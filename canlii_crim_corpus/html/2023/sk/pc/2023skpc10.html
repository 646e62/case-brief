</SPAN>Several years ago, Merlin Kahmahkotayo Jr. was in a common-law
relationship with Melissa Holliday and they have four children. After they
separated, the children resided with their mother. On July 18, 2020, Mr. Kahmahkotayo
stopped by Melissa&rsquo;s residence to deliver a present for one of his children on
her birthday. However, Richard Holliday, Melissa&rsquo;s father, stopped Mr. Kahmahkotayo
as he entered the backyard and asked him to leave before he could see his
daughter. While there is some dispute as to what happened next, there is no
dispute that Mr. Holliday sustained significant trauma to his head during an
altercation with the accused. Mr. Kahmahkotayo is now charged with assaulting
Mr. Holliday &ndash; one count of aggravated assault and one count of assault with a
weapon. Mr. Kahmahkotayo says he acted in self-defense.&nbsp; </P></div>

<P class="Level1" style="margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:0in;

<div class="paragWrapper"><div class="bootstrap unselectable viibes-marker-toolbox" data-with-parag="2" title="Paragraph tools"><div class="dropdown dropleft"><i data-toggle="dropdown" class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i><div class="dropdown-menu"></div></div></div><P class="Level1" style="margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-indent:0in;

</SPAN>I find that Mr. Kahmahkotayo&rsquo;s claim of self-defense must fail. Mr.
Holliday was not capable of being a serious physical threat to him and his
response to the actual threat he was under was not reasonable.&nbsp; Simply put, the</A>
totality of the force applied by Mr. Kahmahkotayo was wholly disproportionate
to actual physical threat (if any) that he faced. Furthermore, I am satisfied
that Mr. Holliday sustained serious bodily harm as a direct result of Mr. Kahmahkotayo&rsquo;s
actions. His injuries were serious and persisted for a significant period of
time, which is sufficient to satisfy the physical elements of an aggravated
assault. &nbsp;</P></div>

</SPAN>Finally, it is not necessary that Mr. Kahmahkotayo intended to wound,
main or disfigure Mr. Holliday. The <I>mens rea</I> requirement for aggravated
assault is objective foresight of bodily harm and I am satisfied that a
reasonable person would have realized that the force Mr. Kahmahkotayo used
would subject Mr. Holliday to the risk of serious bodily harm. </P></div>

Crown called three witnesses &ndash; the complainant, Richard Holliday; his daughter,
Melissa Holliday; and Constable Darcy Burns, a member of the Prince Albert

these reasons for decision, I refer to certain individuals at times by their

</SPAN>Merlin Kahmahkotayo Jr. [Merlin] and Melissa Holliday [Melissa] were in
a common-law relationship for approximately 10 years.&nbsp; Four children were born
from their relationship; Hunter (DOB: Mar 15, 2012); Lillybell (DOB: April 9,
2013); Marylynne (DOB: July 18, 2014); and Mekiwyn (DOB: August 4, 2015).&nbsp; Melissa
and Merlin separated about five years ago.&nbsp; In July of 2020, Melissa and the
children were living at 881 &ndash; 15<SUP>th</SUP> Street West, Prince Albert,
Saskatchewan. At that time, Mr. Kahmahkotayo was living at Sturgeon Lake First

his granddaughter&rsquo;s birthday, and he was at Melissa&rsquo;s house. His grandchildren
were present, together with two other children. Mr. Holliday and Melissa were

playing in the backyard. Mr. Holliday testified that he saw a vehicle drive
down the back alley and stop. Mr. Kahmahkotayo got out and walked toward
Melisa&rsquo;s backyard. Mr. Holliday understood that Merlin was not supposed to come
over unannounced and he was not supposed to be at Melissa&rsquo;s place that day. Mr.

face to face, with Mr. Kahmahkotayo wanting to come in the yard and give a
present to his daughter and with Mr. Holliday blocking him from doing so and telling
him to leave. Mr. Holliday testified that Merlin told him to &ldquo;step back&rdquo; &ndash;

him &ldquo;like a baseball bat&rdquo;. He then fell to the ground. Mr. Holliday told Court
that he thought he might have been &ldquo;knocked out&rdquo; by the force of the impact. He
said the next thing he knew, he was lying face down on the ground. Mr. Holliday
testified that he tried to get up but, but when he did so, Merlin kicked him in

Medical records indicate Mr. Holliday experienced a &ldquo;nasal bone fracture&rdquo; and a
&ldquo;sinus wall fracture, as well as bruising and a laceration on the bridge of the
nose&rdquo;. Mr. Holliday&rsquo;s eye socket was also broken. Medical records indicate
fractures of the right orbital rim. Mr. Holliday was referred to a plastic
surgeon at the Saint Paul&rsquo;s hospital in Saskatoon for follow up for his
fractured nose.&nbsp; Mr. Holliday was also referred to an eye specialist.&nbsp; Finally,
Mr. Holliday had a laceration inside his upper lip that required sutures. In
the days following the incident, Mr. Holliday had black spots in his right eye
that were treated with laser eye surgery &ndash; six treatments in total. Mr. Holliday
testified that it took approximately 5 &frac12; weeks for him to recover except for
his nose, which remained crooked. </P></div>

telling him that she was getting their daughter&rsquo;s ears pierced and that she
planned to have a birthday party for their daughter on Monday &ndash; Monday because
that was the day that Melissa was to receive her July payment under the Canada Child

house. Ms. Holliday testified that she told Merlin not to come by during the
day because her father was already at the house, and that it would cause a

if Merlin came by when her father was there, and she did not want a

father was &ldquo;upset&rdquo; with Merlin. Ms. Holliday explained to Court that she wanted
Mr. Kahmahkotayo to see his children, but just not when her father was there.

that morning.</P></div>

that he should not be there. Ms. Holliday testified that, when she was having

escalated from there. Ms. Holliday testified that she saw Merlin swing the bag
containing the birthday present at her father, and that it was a big swing &ndash;
up, around and down. She said that it was hard to see what was going on because
she was behind her father and his back was toward her. Ms. Holliday testified
that she thought that Merlin had hit her father because she saw her father fall
down. She told Court that initially her father was not face down on the ground.
Ms. Holliday said that, at this point, her father was about halfway to the
ground. Ms. Holliday testified that Mr. Kahmahkotayo then started kicking her
father. She did not say where.</P></div>

</SPAN>Mr. Kahmahkotayo testified that he instinctively responded to Mr.
Holliday&rsquo;s attempted swing at him &ndash; or in response to his belief that Mr.
Holliday was going to swing at him - by punching Mr. Holliday in the face. He
told Court it was just one punch &ndash; it was a closed fist punch to Mr. Holliday&rsquo;s
face. He said that Mr. Holliday then fell to the ground. Mr. Kahmahkotayo
denied kicking Mr. Holliday in the back or anywhere else. However, he admitted
that, when Mr. Holliday tried to get up, he pushed him back down by placing his
foot on Mr. Holliday&rsquo;s bum. Mr. Kahmahkotayo said that it all happened very
fast - so his foot might have made contact with his back, but he thought he
placed his foot on Mr. Holliday&rsquo;s bum. In either event, Mr. Kahmahkotayo denied
kicking Mr. Holliday &ndash; only placing his foot on his back/bum to stop him from
getting back up again. Mr. Kahmahkotayo testified that he prevented Mr.
Holliday from getting back up because he wanted to stop him from coming after
him. </P></div>

&ldquo;yelling and swearing at me&rdquo;. In doing so, his testimony changed. In direct
examination, Mr. Kahmahkotayo said that Mr. Holliday was about to swing at him
and/or that he was preparing to swing at him. However, in response to questions
from the Crown prosecutor as to why he did not just leave, Mr. Kahmahkotayo
said that Mr. Holliday actually swung at him, but that he missed him because
Mr. Kahmahkotayo stepped back. He also acknowledged that, when it appeared that
Mr. Holliday was going to take a swing at him, he could have just walked away &ndash;
but he did not.&nbsp; When asked why he did not just leave, Mr. Kahmahkotayo said

that Mr. Holliday sustained, Mr. Kahmahkotayo denied that he kicked Mr.

</SPAN>Clearly, there is contradiction in the testimony. The complainant and
the accused told two different narratives as to what happened on July 18, 2020.
From the testimony, I must decide what evidence I accept and, based on that
evidence, I must then decide whether or not the Crown has proven its case. It
is a fundamental principle of criminal law that the Crown must present evidence
to the Court to establish each element of the offence and that such evidence
must provide proof beyond a reasonable doubt. If the Crown cannot discharge
this burden, I must acquit the accused. If there is evidence inconsistent with
guilt and I accept that evidence, I must also acquit. If, after hearing all the
evidence, I am left in reasonable doubt by it or I do not know whom to believe,
again I must acquit. In a criminal trial, the burden never shifts from the Crown
to prove its case and to do so beyond a reasonable doubt. See: <I>R v W. (D.),</I>
<A class="reflex3-caselaw" href="/en/ca/scc/doc/1991/1991canlii93/1991canlii93.html">1991 CanLII 93 (SCC)</A>, [1991] 1 SCR 742 at pages 757-58.&nbsp; </P></div>

</SPAN>In evaluating the evidence of the witnesses to determine whether or not
I accept that evidence or whether it raises a doubt in my mind as to the
Crown&rsquo;s case, I can consider a number of factors. These factors include: (a)
the overall likelihood or plausibility of each witness&rsquo;s evidence, (b) the consistency
of that person&rsquo;s evidence with surrounding events, (c) the internal consistency
of the evidence, and (d) the demeanor of the witness and the &ldquo;balance&rdquo; of his/her
evidence.&nbsp; However, I am mindful that I must not simply compare the testimony
of one or another witness, and then choose which version of events I prefer. To
do so would be to misapply the burden of proof. For example, it is possible
that a trial judge might not fully believe an accused&rsquo;s version of events, but
still be uncertain as to what really happened.&nbsp; In that situation, there is
doubt - the benefit of which must go to the accused, See:&nbsp; <I>R v Nyznik</I>,

</SPAN>In this case, I heard contradictory testimony with respect to a number
of facts &ndash; some of these facts relate to elements of the offence, and some
facts are merely collateral, but are relevant for the purpose of assessing credibility
and/or reliability. Credibility is concerned with a witness&rsquo;s veracity. It&rsquo;s about
a witness&rsquo;s honesty &ndash; his/her willingness to tell the truth and to do so without
bias, amplification or obfuscation. Reliability on the other hand does not
involve a witness&rsquo;s willingness to tell the truth. It is about a witness&rsquo;s
ability to accurately retain, recall and communicate facts to the court. A
credible witness&rsquo;s evidence can be wrong and there are a variety of reasons why
someone may not be able to accurately retain and recall past events.&nbsp; For
example, lack of sleep, intoxication, medication, the passage of time, and
intervening events can all have an impact on the durability of our memories.
Furthermore, even reliable witnesses can remember the same event differently,
and not all inconsistencies in the evidence signal a reliability or credibility
issue.&nbsp; On the other hand, sometimes it does. </P></div>

</SPAN>In this case, when I examine the whole of the evidence, I am left with a
concern about the reliability of some of Mr. Holliday&rsquo;s evidence. He
experienced a significant trauma to his head to the extent that he believed
that he was knocked unconscious. First, in light of the injuries he received,
it is entirely possible he was unconscious for a period of time. Second, his
unconsciousness, if it happened, occurred at a crucial point in time &ndash; in the
middle of the altercation. For this reason, I am concerned about Mr. Holliday&rsquo;s
ability to fully and accurately narrate events after he fell to the ground. As
a result, I have given less weight to his evidence (after the point in time he
fell to the ground) unless such evidence has been corroborated by other
evidence that I do accept. Additionally, I have concerns about Mr. Kahmahkotayo&rsquo;s
evidence but for a different reason. Mr. Kahmahkotayo&rsquo;s narration of certain events
was improbable and inconsistent with other evidence I find to be credible and
reliable. Also, a critical part of his evidence changed while under
cross-examination &ndash; namely, whether or not Mr. Holliday actually swung a fist
at him. This was not a case where Mr. Kahmahkotayo&rsquo;s memory was refreshed by
the Crown. Rather, his evidence changed in response to probing
cross-examination. Simply put, I have concerns with respect to the evidence of
both the complainant and the accused &ndash; Mr. Holliday for reasons of reliability
- Mr. Kahmahkotayo for reasons of credibility. </P></div>

was logical and plausible. It was internally consistent and consistent with
surrounding events. In addition, Ms. Holliday&rsquo;s testimony was balanced in that
she was critical of both her father and Mr. Kahmahkotayo. The compelling
inference from her testimony was that her father was misguided in challenging
Merlin in the way he did &ndash; by &ldquo;getting up in his face&rdquo; &ndash; and that he bears some
responsibility for what happened that day. Finally, her demeanor was not of
someone angry with Mr. Kahmahkotayo, but rather of someone sad that violence
had occurred in front of her children. I am left with the compelling inference

embellishment or obfuscation. </P></div>

fact, it is so compelling that it overwhelmed Mr. Kahmahkotayo&rsquo;s denial. Ms.
Holliday&rsquo;s description of her communication was internally logical &ndash; she sent a
message to Merlin when she was at the mall getting her daughter&rsquo;s ears pierced.
She was informing Merlin about a significant event for their daughter &ndash; in fact
for any young child &ndash; getting her ears pierced. Ms. Holliday told the Court
that Mr. Kahmahkotayo said he had a present for their daughter and he wanted to
give it to her. Ms. Holliday told him not to come by the house that day because
her father was already there, and she was concerned about a confrontation. During
this communication, Ms. Holliday told Merlin she was planning a birthday party
for their daughter on Monday. The conversation as described by Ms. Holliday was

that Melissa told him that she was going to take their daughter to get her ears
pierced. However, in this conversation, Mr. Kahmahkotayo did not mention that
he had already bought or was planning to buy a gift for her or that he wanted
to give that present to her on her birthday. It is improbable in the extreme
that Mr. Kahmahkotayo would not mention his desire to give a gift to his
daughter during a conversation with Ms. Holliday about their daughter and her
birthday even if that conversation took place the day before her birthday. The
compelling inference &ndash; in fact the only reasonable inference that can be drawn
from the evidence - is that Mr. Kahmahkotayo did receive Ms. Holliday&rsquo;s message
telling him not to come to her house that day, but that he denied receiving
this message because it cast him in an unfavourable light. This fact is not an
element of either of the offences for which he was charged, but it is relevant

events. Mr. Kahmahkotayo told Court that Mr. Holliday aggressively confronted
him in the yard, that he unkindly told him to leave, and that all this happened
in front of Melissa. Mr. Kahmahkotayo would have me believe that, upon seeing
this confrontation beginning to occur, Ms. Holliday did not say anything to
either her father or him. Rather, according to his testimony, Ms. Holliday calmly
went in the house to get his daughter and the other children just happened to
follow her in the house, leaving him and Mr. Holliday alone in the backyard. </P></div>

</SPAN>In direct examination, when Mr. Kahmahkotayo first narrated his
confrontation with Mr. Holliday in Melissa&rsquo;s backyard, he did not say that Mr.
Holliday swung at him or that he stepped back to avoid being struck by Mr.
Holliday&rsquo;s fist. Rather, Mr. Kahmahkotayo testified that he believed that Mr.
Holliday was <U>about</U> to swing at him because Mr. Holliday was being
aggressive toward him, swearing at him, and he began to pull his arm back to
swing at him. As I have already noted, Mr. Kahmahkotayo&rsquo;s evidence changed
during cross-examination. In answering questions from the Crown prosecutor
about why he did not just walk away from Mr. Holliday if he was being
aggressive toward him, Mr. Kahmahkotayo told Court that Mr. Holliday actually
did take a swing at him. In this changed narrative, Mr. Kahmahkotayo said that
he stepped back to avoid the swing. </P></div>

</SPAN>In my opinion, this is not the kind of evidence that could reasonably
change. It is improbable in the extreme that, if Mr. Holliday actually swung a
fist at Mr. Kahmahkotayo during their confrontation in the yard, he would not
say that in Court when originally asked to describe the incident. The fact that
Mr. Kahmahkotayo&rsquo;s evidence on this point changed, undermined his credibility
as a witness. Furthermore, while Mr. Holliday was agitated by Mr.
Kahmahkotayo&rsquo;s presence in Melissa&rsquo;s yard and while he was prepared to
physically block Mr. Kahmahkotayo from entering further into the yard with his
body, other than Mr. Kahmahkotayo&rsquo;s assertion, there is no evidence that Mr.
Holliday&rsquo;s conduct was assaultive in nature. Ms. Holliday specifically denied seeing
her father take a swing at Merlin or even attempt to. While it could have
happened while her back was turned or when she was in the house with the children,
it seems improbable under the circumstances. Until that point in time, while
Mr. Holliday was verbally aggressive with Mr. Kahmahkotayo, his actions &ndash; his
physical conduct &ndash; involved blocking Mr. Kahmahkotayo from coming further into
the yard with this body and by getting in his face. While his conduct was
provocative, it is improbable that Mr. Holliday tried to punch Mr. Kahmahkotayo.

</SPAN>While Mr. Kahmahkotayo denied that he kicked Mr. Holliday while he was
on the ground (in the face or anywhere else), Ms. Holliday testified that she
saw Merlin kicking her father when she was gathering up the children to take
them in the house and that she saw Merlin kick her father one more time when
she came back out of the house. On this point, Ms. Holliday&rsquo;s evidence was so
clear and so compelling, that it wholly overwhelmed Mr. Kahmahkotayo&rsquo;s denial.
While Mr. Holliday said that Merlin kicked him in the face, Ms. Holliday did
not see that happen. Simply put, it is possible that Mr. Kahmahkotayo kicked
him in the face, and it is equally possible that he did not. Mr. Holliday&rsquo;s
injuries are consistent with being kicked in the face and it is possible that
it happened while Ms. Holliday&rsquo;s back was turned. On the other hand, it is also
possible that Mr. Holliday sustained his injuries when he was punched in the
face &ndash; if it was a particularly violent punch. </P></div>

</SPAN>Mr. Kahmahkotayo was very critical of Mr. Holliday. In his counsel&rsquo;s
words, &ldquo;Mr. Holliday started this whole mess.&rdquo; He noted that all parties agreed
that Mr. Kahmahkotayo was not aggressive when he arrived, and that it would
have been obvious that he only wanted to give a present to his daughter on her
birthday. Mr. Kahmahkotayo said that Mr. Holliday was the aggressor &ndash; that he
was aggressive toward him, that he was abusive, and that he swung first. Mr.
Kahmahkotayo acknowledged that he punched Mr. Holliday. However, he said that
he only did so in self-defense &ndash; in response to Mr. Holliday taking a swing at
him. &nbsp;Finally, Mr. Kahmahkotayo told Court that he never intended to cause the
extent of injuries that Mr. Holliday suffered &ndash; that he responded out of
instinct &ndash; the need to meet force with force. </P></div>

</SPAN>The defence of self-defence is now codified in <A class="reflex2-link" concatenated-id="12792-current-1" s="34" href="/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec34_smooth">s. 34</A> of the <I><A class="reflex2-link" concatenated-id="12792-current-1" href="/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html">Criminal
Code</A></I>. While this section has broad application, the most common
circumstance where it applies is where force is used to resist force. For
example, a person who is the victim of an unprovoked assault is entitled to use
force to defend themselves provided the force used is reasonable and for the
purpose of defending themselves. In advancing the defence of self-defence, an
accused acknowledges the intentional application of force but takes the
position that the force he/she applied was justified under the circumstances.
See: <I>R v Ryan</I>, <A class="reflex3-caselaw" href="/en/ca/scc/doc/2013/2013scc3/2013scc3.html">2013 SCC 3 (CanLII)</A>, [2013] 1 SCR 14 at para. <A class="reflex-parag" href="/en/ca/scc/doc/2013/2013scc3/2013scc3.html#par26">26</A>. I would like to note that
while I refer to an accused &ldquo;advancing&rdquo; self-defence, there is no onus on the
accused to prove anything. If there is an air of reality to the accused&rsquo;s
assertion that he/she acted in self-defence, the Crown must negate the
application of the defence. If it does not do so, the accused is entitled to an
acquittal.</P></div>

</SPAN>Subsection 34(1) provides that a person is not guilty of an offence (including
assault) if three essential elements are present: (1) the accused must have a
reasonable belief that force is being used or threatened against them (or
another person); (2) the actions of the accused must be for the purpose of
defending themselves or protecting others from that force; and (3) the actions
of the accused, including the degree of force used, must be reasonable in the
circumstances. See: <I>R v Pankiw</I>, <A class="reflex3-caselaw" href="/en/sk/skqb/doc/2014/2014skqb381/2014skqb381.html">2014 SKQB 381</A> at para <A class="reflex-parag" href="/en/sk/skqb/doc/2014/2014skqb381/2014skqb381.html#par27">27</A>, 462 Sask R 217.
For the trier of fact, the accused&rsquo;s perception of the threat and their belief
that they are defending themselves (or another) is assessed on a subjective
basis (from the subject&rsquo;s perspective). However, the reasonableness of the
subject&rsquo;s response is measured on a modified objective basis (what would a
reasonable person &ndash; a person with similar characteristics and experiences as
the accused - have done in those circumstances).&nbsp; See: <I>Pankiw</I> at para

</SPAN>As I have already noted in these Reasons, Mr. Kahmahkotayo did not go to
Melissa&rsquo;s house for a confrontation. He went there to give a birthday gift to
his daughter. Because Mr. Holliday was there and because Melissa did not want a
confrontation, she asked Mr. Kahmahkotayo to leave. Unfortunately, the dynamic
between the two men escalated into a confrontation - with Mr. Kahmahkotayo
wanting to give his daughter a gift, with Mr. Holliday unwilling to let him do
so, and with both men set on their respective goals. While Melissa told Mr.
Kahmahkotayo to leave, the reason she did so was because her father was there.
By her own evidence, if her father had not been there, she would have permitted
Mr. Kahmahkotayo to see his daughter and give her his gift. Whether he knew it
or not, Mr. Holliday was the catalyst for the confrontation. His presence
frustrated Mr. Kahmahkotayo&rsquo;s desire to see his daughter on her birthday and
his demeaner toward Mr. Kahmahkotayo unnecessarily inflamed the situation. &nbsp;Nonetheless,
the defence of self-defence does not permit force to be used in response to
disappointment or the frustrations of dealing with an unapologetic and
unreasonable ex-father-in-law. The defence only applied in response to the threat
of <U>physical</U> force. </P></div>

</SPAN>Even if I assume that Mr. Holliday took a swing at him (which I think is
unlikely), the nature of the threat of force that Mr. Kahmahkotayo was exposed
was not serious. Mr. Holliday was 60 years old at the time of the incident. During
his testimony, Mr. Holliday presented as a frail individual who had not aged
well &ndash; I would have guessed he was in his 70&rsquo;s. On the other hand, Mr. Holliday
was not frail of words. He spoke his mind with confidence. Mr. Holliday&rsquo;s conduct
toward Mr. Kahmahkotayo on July 18, 2020 was unnecessarily disrespectful, if
not insulting. </P></div>

</SPAN>The problem for Mr. Kahmahkotayo in advancing self-defence is that Mr.
Holliday was not capable of being a serious <U>physical</U> threat to him and
his response to the actual threat he was under at the time was wholly
disproportionate. Simply put, Mr. Kahmahkotayo&rsquo;s response to the potential threat
was unreasonable under the circumstances. Even if I assume that Mr. Holliday
did swing at Mr. Kahmahkotayo (which I find unlikely), by his own admission,
Mr. Kahmahkotayo stepped back from it. Mr. Kahmahkotayo had numerous other
means available to respond to the potential use of force, including continuing
to step back to create separation from Mr. Holliday. However, Mr.
Kahmahkotayo&rsquo;s response to the potential use of force was to punch Mr. Holliday
with sufficient force to knock him to the ground, and then to kicked Mr.
Holliday while he was on the ground. Medical records indicate Mr. Holliday
experienced a nasal bone fracture and a sinus wall fracture, as well as
bruising and a laceration on the bridge of the nose. Mr. Holliday&rsquo;s eye socket
was also broken. Finally, Mr. Holiday had a laceration inside his upper lip
that required sutures.&nbsp; These injuries occurred either because of one massive punch
or during the subsequent kicks while he was on the ground. Either way, Mr.
Kahmahkotayo caused Mr. Holliday&rsquo;s injuries. </P></div>

am satisfied that the Crown has negated the defence of self-defence. While Mr.
Kahmahkotayo&rsquo;s desire to bring a gift to his daughter on her birthday was reasonable,
his actions cannot be justified under s. 34 of the <I>Code</I>. </P></div>

</SPAN>Mr. Kahmahkotayo was charged with assault with a weapon, to wit: a
present. This charge arose because Mr. Holliday&rsquo;s believed that Mr.
Kahmahkotayo struck him with the gift bag he brought for his daughter &ndash; he
believed it was the present that struck him in the arm and his head, and
knocked him to the ground. In support of this belief, Ms. Holliday saw the gift
bag swing through the air and strike her father. However, the contents of the
gift bag as described by the parties &ndash; a dress, colouring book, small toys,
etc. &ndash; would not have had sufficient mass to cause any of the serious injuries
that Mr. Holliday sustained. Simply put, Mr. Kahmahkotayo did not strike Mr.
Holliday with a present &ndash; he struck Mr. Holliday with his fist. The gift bag
was merely an unintended passenger that came along with Mr. Kahmahkotayo&rsquo;s punch.
Under these circumstances, I am not satisfied &ndash; certainly not beyond a
reasonable doubt &ndash; that the gift bag Mr. Kahmahkotayo brought for his daughter
became a weapon during the assault. Rather, it was just another victim in a sad
turn of events. </P></div>

wound, as the word is used in s. 268(1) of the <I>Code</I>, is a break in the

integrity, health or well-being of the complainant. This is a finding of fact,

resolved with sutures. The injuries to his right eye were serious and required
laser treatment to resolve. Mr. Holliday reports that his nose remained crooked
even after it healed. All of these injuries required advanced medical
intervention. I am satisfied that these injuries were serious, and their
cumulative effect was to interfere in a substantial way with Mr. Holliday&rsquo;s
