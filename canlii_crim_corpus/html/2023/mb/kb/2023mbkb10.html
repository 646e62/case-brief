</SPAN>The police investigation determined that Ahmed
was beaten and died in a residence at 1046 Royse Avenue (&ldquo;Royse&rdquo;) on October
10, 2020. &nbsp;Brightnose-Baker and a masked intruder brandishing a firearm forced
Ahmed into the bathroom of the small bungalow. &nbsp;Ahmed could be heard yelling
and begging for his life as he was viscously assaulted. </P></div>

blunt force trauma to the head. </P></div>

</SPAN>Upon arrest, Brightnose-Baker gave a statement to
the police admitting involvement in the assault of Ahmed. &nbsp;Brightnose-Baker
claims when he left the residence, Ahmed was still alive and the evidence against
him supports a conviction for manslaughter not murder.&nbsp; I pause to note that
the statement from Brightnose-Baker can only be used as evidence against him
and it cannot be used as evidence against Daher. </P></div>

beyond a reasonable doubt that he was involved in this matter. &nbsp;There was no
physical evidence such as fingerprints or DNA to connect Daher to this
homicide. &nbsp;He submits I might be suspicious that he was the masked intruder
brandishing a firearm but maintains the Crown has failed to discharge their
onus to prove identity beyond a reasonable doubt. </P></div>

</SPAN>This case involves a violent, senseless death
connected to the criminal drug subculture in Winnipeg. &nbsp;The victim and all
civilian witnesses who testified are or were heavy drug users. &nbsp;The drug of
choice was predominately methamphetamine (&ldquo;meth&rdquo;), although some witnesses
consumed other hard drugs. &nbsp;The evidence clearly demonstrates that Winnipeg has
a serious meth problem. &nbsp;The police and civilian witnesses testified about the
crime, danger and violence associated with the criminal drug problem in the
city. </P></div>

</SPAN>It is clear that all of the witnesses involved in
this drug lifestyle understand the code of the street. &nbsp;There is tremendous
pressure to remain silent, not to cooperate with the police or prosecution as
cooperation or the perception of cooperation will have you labelled a &ldquo;rat&rdquo;. &nbsp;&nbsp;Words
have power and being labelled a &ldquo;rat&rdquo; puts your health and safety at risk. </P></div>

</SPAN>At the time of this incident, it is fair to
describe Royse as a &ldquo;flop house&rdquo;, a place where people go to do drugs. &nbsp;Colin
Leiterman (&ldquo;Leiterman&rdquo;) and James Freitas (&ldquo;Freitas&rdquo;) lived there as roommates
and shared the rent.&nbsp; Meghan Burnett (&ldquo;Burnett&rdquo;) was the girlfriend of Freitas
and she was present on October 10, 2020. &nbsp;I have not heard any evidence from
Freitas or Burnett, as they did not attend court. &nbsp;I issued warrants for their
arrest on the first day of the trial.&nbsp; I also issued a warrant for the arrest

never before met the man. &nbsp;They were both in the living room, said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s

who struck Ahmed in the head with the toilet tank lid. &nbsp;She also speculates

inflict these types of injuries. &nbsp;The type of force required would be similar
to swinging a baseball bat to the skull. &nbsp;Dr. Littman opined the head wounds
and skull fractures were caused by at least three or four blows and up to 10 or
more. &nbsp;The wounds were caused by a blunt object. &nbsp;Dr. Littman agreed that a
number of different objects could have caused the injuries including a toilet
tank lid. </P></div>

were many lacerations caused by sharp force injures throughout the body. &nbsp;Some

later in life.&nbsp; It is clear that she is an intelligent and thoughtful person. &nbsp;She

</SPAN>Derendorf did not exaggerate or embellish her

logical and fits with all of the other evidence presented in court. &nbsp;She was
cross-examined at length by counsel for Daher. She was unmoved. &nbsp;She provided
emotional but consistent evidence about Daher&rsquo;s violent assault against her.
The more she was questioned, the stronger her evidence. &nbsp;She provided details
about her injuries both physical and emotional. &nbsp;She was unshaken on
cross-examination. &nbsp;The most difficult witness to cross-examine is the witness

&ldquo;skinner&rdquo;.&nbsp; Daher told her he tortured and killed Ahmed when he was in the tub

torturing Ahmed, he learned information of his home address and I conclude the
masked passenger in the taxi was Daher going to the victim&rsquo;s residence. </P></div>

Ahmed was beaten and he was afraid of Daher so he gave Ahmed a few punches to
seem like he was taking part of it. &nbsp;Brightnose-Baker said Ahmed wanted to
live. &nbsp;He told Derendorf he wished Ahmed would just die to be out of the misery

they went to 1046 Royce. &nbsp;I find Brightnose-Baker was armed with a collapsible
baton. &nbsp;I suspect Ahmed recognized Brightnose-Baker from the incident on Victor
and tried to leave. &nbsp;I accept the evidence from Martel. &nbsp;It was
Brightnose-Baker who struck Ahmed with the baton while in the living room. &nbsp;He
also struck Martel twice in the arm resulting in bruising to his hand that was
still visible ten days later. </P></div>

</SPAN>I reject Brightnose-Baker&rsquo;s evidence that it was
Leiterman who had the baton and struck Ahmed. &nbsp;Leiterman was never questioned
on this point. &nbsp;As I said, this was a targeted attack. &nbsp;Brightnose-Baker and
Daher were involved in a dangerous lifestyle. Common sense suggests they were

was there from the start to the end. &nbsp;He admits that he cleaned up blood with a
cloth and a mop. &nbsp;He cleaned the residence for an hour. &nbsp;This was not his
residence. &nbsp;There was only one reason for him to clean it up and that was to
remove evidence. &nbsp;The length of time he was there, the injuries inflicted and
the blood in the residence speaks to the condition of Ahmed and the intent of
the accused. &nbsp;The totality of the evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt Daher
and Brightnose-Baker meant to cause his death and are guilty of second-degree
murder. </P></div>

</SPAN>The totality of the evidence proves Daher was
the masked intruder who brandished the sawed-off shotgun. &nbsp;On October 20, 2020,
Martel told the police Daher pointed the sawed-off shotgun at him and told him
to get out of the way.&nbsp; I acknowledge Martel backed away from that statement in
his testimony. &nbsp;Again, that is not surprising given he was testifying in the
presence of the co-accused. &nbsp;It was clear to me that Martel was afraid during
his testimony. &nbsp;He does not want to be known as a rat since that is a dangerous
label.&nbsp; </P></div>

</SPAN>I find Daher did point the sawed-off shotgun at
Martel and told him to get out of the way. &nbsp;This was a targeted attack. &nbsp;Daher
was after Ahmed. &nbsp;Martel was in the way. Ahmed knew he was in trouble and was
fighting back against Brightnose-Baker. &nbsp;Daher was armed with a sawed-off
shotgun. &nbsp;He pointed it at Martel to gain control and compliance. &nbsp;That type of
weapon is possessed to intimidate and instill fear. &nbsp;It is favoured for its lethal
nature and ease of concealment. &nbsp;It is often hidden in a pant leg, jacket or
backpack. &nbsp;I note, Daher had a backpack when he left in the taxi. &nbsp;He still had
a sawed-off shotgun after this incident when he moved in with Derendorf on
Austin. </P></div>
