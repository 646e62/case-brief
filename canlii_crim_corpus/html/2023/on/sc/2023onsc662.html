</SPAN>This case arises out of an alleged home invasion
in the early morning hours of May 6, 2020. The complainants allege that several
individuals entered their home while they were sleeping, physically assaulted
them and stole money and other valuables including an iPhone. There were four
individuals who resided in the home at the time of this incident. They were Mr.
Conrad Leung, his wife Sara Wu, and their two children, Calvin and Christopher
Leung.</P></div>

</SPAN>After the incident had occurred 911 was called
at 5:26 a.m. Subsequently, Calvin Leung noticed that his cellphone was missing.
He was able to track it with the benefit of a computer program on his laptop to
a Comfort Inn located at 8330 Woodbine Avenue. At the Comfort Inn police
initially arrested an Asian male identified as Mr. Zhen Zhen who had a key card
to a hotel room. It was subsequently determined that the key card was connected
to Room 242 at the Inn. Police then arrested three individuals in Room 242.
They were identified as a black male, Mr. Kwabena Asare, another black male,
Mr. Elijah Bishop and another Asian, Mr. Bin Chen, who is the defendant in this
action. </P></div>

the Crown advised that they are no longer pursuing a charge of aggravated
assault against Mr. Chen. Instead, the Crown asserts that Mr. Chen should be
convicted of the lesser included offence of assault causing bodily harm. This
request was made on the basis that the Crown did not tender scientific or
medical evidence of the nature of Ms. Wu&rsquo;s injuries and that her non-expert
testimony about the nature of her injuries was insufficient to establish beyond

</SPAN>With respect to this Count, Ms. Wu testified
that she thought two people entered her room. One was pressing down on her head
and one was putting duct tape on her mouth. The intruders then tied her hands
behind her back and used plastic ties to bind her hands. While she was being
tied up she was moving and the intruders hit her on the head. The intruders
also used a bag to cover her head and dragged her off the bed. As the intruders
tied her hands they twisted her around. After the incident her right forearm
was found to be very painful and injured. She was taken to the hospital and
underwent surgery for a fracture of her right forearm. There is a visible scar
on her right forearm from the surgery. She was also in a cast for two to three
weeks and was not able to use her right arm during that period of time. She
described the pain in her arm as being a &ldquo;9 out of 10&rdquo;. Based on the evidence
of Ms. Wu on that issue, which was not called into question during the course
of her cross-examination and the corroborating evidence of the scar on her
right forearm, I have concluded that Ms. Wu was subject to an assault causing
bodily harm during the home invasion.</P></div>

</SPAN>In order to establish liability under s. 21(2),

</SPAN>The accused argues that he was not involved in

him ever being in the house either by way of fingerprints or his DNA. Further
the defence points to the fact that Mr. Chen is never seen carrying any bags or
equipment into the hotel and there is nothing to suggest that he was a part of
the group who committed the break and enter. The defence acknowledges that even
if Mr. Chen is found to have been in the vehicle outside the residence, there
was no evidence that he actually entered the residence. His mere presence at
the scene of the home invasion is not sufficient to make a finding of guilt.</P></div>

reasons why Mr. Chen did not participate in the robbery. For example they
suggest that he may have decided at the last minute not to participate in the
robbery.</P></div>

</SPAN>I start from the proposition that the evidence
of Mr. Chen&rsquo;s participation in the robbery is wholly circumstantial. In <I>R.
v. Villaroman</I>, <A class="reflex3-caselaw" href="/en/ca/scc/doc/2016/2016scc33/2016scc33.html">2016 SCC 33</A>, the Supreme Court dealt with the issue of
circumstantial evidence. The Court notes that the essential component of
circumstantial evidence is that in order to convict, a court must be satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt that the only rational inference that can be drawn
from the circumstantial evidence is that the accused is guilty. The Court goes
on to note that when assessing circumstantial evidence the trier of fact should
consider other plausible theories and other reasonable possibilities which are
inconsistent with guilt. Other plausible theories must be based on &ldquo;logic and
experience applied to the evidence or the absence of evidence, not on
speculation.&rdquo; The Court notes that the line between a &ldquo;plausible theory&rdquo; and
&ldquo;speculation&rdquo; is not always easy to draw. But the basic question is whether the
circumstantial evidence, viewed logically and in light of human experience, &ldquo;is
reasonably capable of supporting an inference other than that the accused is
guilty.&rdquo; In clarifying the law to be drawn between speculation and reasonable
inferences the Court notes that a trier of fact should not act on alternative
interpretations of the circumstances that it considers to be unreasonable and
that alternative inferences must be reasonable, not just possible.</P></div>

They are Mr. Asare, Mr. Bishop and Mr. Zhen. In the Agreed Statement of Facts,
DNA evidence clearly linked Mr. Bishop and Mr. Asare to the victims of the home
invasion. In particular, the Agreed Statement of Facts identifies that Conrad
Leung&rsquo;s DNA and Mr. Asare&rsquo;s DNA were both found on a glove recovered by the
police from the garbage bin in Room 242 at the Comfort Inn hotel. In addition,
the Agreed Statement of Facts identifies that Ms. Wu&rsquo;s DNA was found on a latex
glove seized from Mr. Bishop&rsquo;s pocket by police immediately following Mr.
Bishop&rsquo;s arrest at Room 242 of the Comfort Inn hotel.</P></div>

</SPAN>With respect to Mr. Zhen, he is clearly
identified in the surveillance video that matches his booking video and is
clearly seen in the Comfort Inn timeline video carrying the backpack that
contains the handguns, tools of crime, and the stolen iPhone and purse, and
which was subsequently found in Room 242 of the Comfort Inn by the police.</P></div>

</SPAN>The timeline video was introduced into evidence
from the Comfort Inn hotel. The video shows the parking area of the hotel as
well as the eastern entrance to the hotel. Evidence at the trial confirmed that
Room 242 is located on the second floor on the very eastern side of the hotel.
The pictures from the hotel video can then be compared to the booking video of
the four accused persons who were later taken to the police station that
morning. The characteristics of Mr. Asare which are consistent between the
hotel video and the booking video are that he was wearing black shoes. These
shoes had a very distinctive white or reflective spot on the top of the shoes.
The shoes are also black around the outside of the soles. He is also wearing a
hooded jacket and black pants. I am satisfied that video taken from the hotel
and the booking videos demonstrate that Mr. Asare entered and left the Comfort
Inn east side exit on several occasions that evening. That together with the
DNA evidence satisfies me that Mr. Asare was one of the intruders at the Leung
residence.</P></div>

Bishop is also seen in sneakers which are black, but which have white outside
the sole. His skin colour is black which is observable at 11:03 of the hotel
video as he enters the eastern entrance. Together with the DNA evidence, I am
satisfied that Mr. Bishop was also one of the perpetrators of the home
invasion.</P></div>

</SPAN>Mr. Zhen is of Asian descent. He is seen
entering and leaving the eastern exit of the hotel with a backpack which
matches a backpack found in Room 242 of the Comfort Inn. He is also observed to
be wearing sneakers with white around the outside of the soles and which have
black uppers. He is seen to be of a slim build. At 5:41 a.m. he is seen entering
the east entrance of the Comfort Inn hotel wearing a sweater which has five
distinctive white rings on his left arm. These match exactly to the sweater he
was wearing at the time of booking. I am satisfied that it was in fact Mr. Zhen
seen coming and going from the Comfort Inn. Given that the backpack carried by
him was found in Room 242 to contain the break in tools as well as the property
stolen in the home invasion, it seems likely that Mr. Zhen was the leader of
the group who committed the home invasion.</P></div>

</SPAN>The fourth person seen in the timeline video at
the hotel I have concluded is Mr. Chen. He can be seen arriving at the eastern
entrance of the hotel at 3:36 a.m. He has got long hair and is wearing a ball
cap. He is also wearing a coat which has two distinctive white rings at the
collar. This is consistent with the coat he was wearing in the booking video.
Another distinct similarity is the outline of his grey shirt which is seen at

</SPAN>The hotel timeline video is also significant as
it shows that Mr. Chen is seen entering the eastern entrance to the hotel and
walking up the stairs to the second floor at 3:36 a.m. with Mr. Zhen (the
evidence is that the Comfort Inn only had two floors). Mr. Asare and Mr. Bishop
have previously entered the hotel and gone up to the second floor as well.
There is then a 26-minute and 40-second gap. I infer that Mr. Chen, Mr. Zhen as
well as Mr. Asare and Mr. Bishop have all gone to Room 242 of the hotel.</P></div>

</SPAN>There is then a 1-hour and 27-minute gap.
According to the evidence of the complainants, the home invasion takes place
somewhere around 4:30 to 5:00 a.m. The first 911 call made by Calvin during the
course of the home invasion is received by 911 at 5:16 a.m. A second 911 call
occurred at 5:18 a.m. This apparently was from one of the intruders trying to
satisfy the 911 operators that there was no need to be concerned about any
problem at the house. A third 911 call occurred at 5:26 a.m. This was
Christopher Leung calling after the intruders left the home. His evidence is
that he called about 90 seconds after the intruders departed. Based on this
evidence I have concluded that the intruders left the residence at around 5:24
to 5:26 a.m.</P></div>

</SPAN>At 5:36 a.m. the vehicle containing the four
individuals pulled into the parking lot of the Comfort Inn from the street and
parked. The four individuals spent three minutes inside the van which remained
parked. At 5:40 a.m. the four individuals exited the van and proceeded to the
east entrance to the hotel.</P></div>

</SPAN>Detective Bosomworth estimated in his evidence that
it would tale approximately 10 minutes travelling fast to go from the Leung
home to the Comfort Inn. If they were driving at the speed limit it would take
no more than 14 minutes assuming there were no traffic issues. It is apparent,
therefore, that the intruders&rsquo; vehicle travelled directly from the Leung home
to the Comfort Inn. The evidence of Calvin Leung is that he could track the
intruders&rsquo; vehicle going along Highway 407. It is apparent that the vehicle
would not have had an opportunity to pick up Mr. Chen at a different location.
I therefore infer from this evidence that Mr. Chen went to the scene of the
home invasion and returned from the scene of the home invasion together with
the other three individuals who were in the car. This evidence satisfies me
that Mr. Chen was at the scene of the home invasion. There is, a significant
issue, however, as to whether Mr. Chen entered the home with the other three
individuals. Or whether, as suggested by the defence, he might not have entered
the home and remained either in the car or outside in the vicinity of the home.</P></div>

</SPAN>I have therefore concluded that Mr. Chen was
physically at the scene of the home invasion when it occurred on May 6, 2020
based on the evidence of Calvin Leung that he tracked the vehicle used by those
who invaded the home travelling along Highway 407, together with the evidence
of Detective Bosomworth that it would take about 10-14 minutes for the vehicle
to travel from the scene of the home invasion to the Comfort Inn hotel.</P></div>

</SPAN>There is, as noted earlier, a significant issue
as to whether Mr. Chen entered the home at the time of the home invasion. The
defence position is that there is a reasonable doubt that there were four
people in the home at the time of the home invasion. The Crown position is that
all four individuals were in the home.</P></div>

</SPAN>Three of the complainants testified that they
heard Chinese being spoken by the intruders. Conrad Leung testified that he
heard one person saying something in Mandarin in his room to someone in the
hallway and heard the other person answer back in Mandarin. Conrad Leung
testified that while his family spoke Cantonese, he has some familiarity with
the Mandarin language. The other language spoken by the intruders was in
English.</P></div>

least one other person involved in the home invasion who would understand what
was being said. </P></div>

someone speaking in Mandarin during this incident.</P></div>

<div class="paragWrapper"><div class="bootstrap unselectable viibes-marker-toolbox" data-with-parag="58" title="Paragraph tools"><div class="dropdown dropleft"><i data-toggle="dropdown" class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i><div class="dropdown-menu"></div></div></div><P class="MainParagraph" data-viibes-parag="58" data-viibes-start="57" data-viibes-end="56">[<A class="reflex-paragAnchor" name="par58">58</A>]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>I accept the evidence that two of the
individuals who were part of the home invasion spoke in Mandarin. Nevertheless,
this evidence does not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Chen was in
the home. That is because there was no evidence before me which confirms
whether or not the two black intruders spoke Mandarin. Nevertheless, it seems
more likely that the speakers talking in Mandarin were of Asian descent which
would suggest that the two people speaking Mandarin were Mr. Zhen and Mr. Chen.
Having said that, while it seems likely that Mr. Chen and Mr. Zhen were the
ones who spoke Mandarin at the time of the home invasion, it is only a factor
to consider and is not determinative in the absence of any evidence as to
whether either of the two black intruders spoke Mandarin. </P></div>

</SPAN>Another important issue is the number of people
who entered the home. The defendant argues that there were only three people
who could be identified as participating in the home invasion. Of course, if
there were four people who came into the home it would inevitably mean that Mr.
Chen must have been the fourth person who entered the home. The complainants
were cross-examined closely with respect to their estimate of how many
intruders were in the home. </P></div>

</SPAN>Sara Wu in her evidence stated that she believed
three to four people were in the house. She stated that initially she thought
that there were two intruders in her room. One was pressing down on her head
and one was putting duct tape over her mouth. She also could hear voices
outside of her room including her husband who was heard asking someone not to
hurt his family. One of the intruders subsequently left the room. In
cross-examination she stated that she believed there were three and maybe four
people who left the home. </P></div>

</SPAN>Calvin Leung testified that he saw two intruders
directly but thought that there were three or four in the house in total. Later
he testified that he thought there were four intruders in the home. He first
testified that there were two intruders in the master bedroom. One was left in
the master bedroom with he and his mother. He believed two intruders were with his
dad as he believed that the intruders when clearing the rooms involved two
people. This appeared to be an assumption on his part. He also felt there was
one person with his brother. Later he stated that he thought there was one
person with his mother, one person with his father, one person with his brother
and one person who found his cellphone in his room. There is clearly an
inconsistency in his evidence as to how he calculated the number of intruders
who were in the house. In addition, in cross-examination it was suggested to
him that there could not have been more than three persons in the house. He
responded that he was not able to determine that. In light of Calvin Leung&rsquo;s
differing versions of his evidence as to how many people were in the house, I
do not place any reliance on his evidence suggesting that there was a fourth
person who entered the home. </P></div>

</SPAN>Conrad Leung was quite firm in his evidence in
stating that it sounded like four or five people came into the home. He
testified that he encountered two people who came into his room. He could hear
one person in his wife&rsquo;s room and he could hear one person in the hallway. That
made for a minimum of four people in the home. Conrad Leung&rsquo;s evidence is
supported by the evidence of Ms. Wu and his son Calvin Leung who testified that
initially there were two people in the master bedroom and that subsequently one
of them left. It is also supported by the evidence of Christopher Leung who
testified that initially he ran into two people, one of whom who tackled him.
He testified there was one person holding him down, one person in the hallway
and he thought there might be two people in his mother&rsquo;s bedroom. Conrad Leung
was cross-examined about his estimate of four people being in the house. He
remained quite firm in stating that he did not think there were only three
people in the house. He thought there were four or five people in the
residence.</P></div>

</SPAN>I found that Conrad Leung was a very credible
witness. His explanation as to how he calculated the minimum number of people
in the house was quite precise and he did not move off this position during the
course of his evidence. It was also consistent with the evidence of the other
family members about their experience during the home invasion.</P></div>

</SPAN>Christopher Leung also testified that he thought
there were four to five people in the home. He stated that when the intruders
left the home he heard four to five sets of footsteps. He also thought he heard
two people in his mother&rsquo;s room, another person in the hallway and one person
was holding him down. There was also some support for this evidence in that we
know from the evidence of Sara Wu and Calvin Leung that there were initially two
intruders in the mother&rsquo;s room and the evidence of Conrad Leung is that he
heard another person in the hallway. In cross-examination, it was suggested to Christopher
Leung that there may have been only three intruders in the house. He disagreed
with this suggestion but when asked if he could be sure about the number of
people in the house he responded &ldquo;no&rdquo;. In re-examination, he advised that he
meant to disagree with the suggestion that there were only three intruders in
the house.</P></div>

</SPAN>I felt that Christopher Leung was a good
witness. He appeared to have a good recollection of the details of the home
invasion. Nevertheless, I felt that at the conclusion of his cross-examination
he was in fact indicating that he was not sure about the number of intruders in
the home.</P></div>

</SPAN>In the end I felt that the most reliable
estimate about the number of intruders in the home came from Conrad Leung.
Having said that, I recognize that when the home invasion occurred the
complainants were taken by surprise. This was a rapidly evolving event that
took place in the dark. While I felt that Conrad Leung&rsquo;s evidence was the most
reliable evidence about the number of people in the home I am not prepared to
accept it as proof beyond a reasonable doubt that there were four intruders in
the home. I do, however, find that it is a very substantial piece of evidence
which strongly suggests that Mr. Chen entered the home together with the 3
other intruders.</P></div>

<div class="paragWrapper"><div class="bootstrap unselectable viibes-marker-toolbox" data-with-parag="67" title="Paragraph tools"><div class="dropdown dropleft"><i data-toggle="dropdown" class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i><div class="dropdown-menu"></div></div></div><P class="MainParagraph" data-viibes-parag="67" data-viibes-start="66" data-viibes-end="65">[<A class="reflex-paragAnchor" name="par67">67</A>]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>Although Mr. Chen is seen in the hotel wearing a
baseball cap and while none of the complainants identified an intruder was wearing
a baseball hat, I do not consider this as being particularly significant.
Conrad Leung gave evidence that a bag was put over his head which he later
determined was his pillow case. Sara Wu also testified that a plastic bag was
put over her head. Calvin Leung testified that tape was put around his head
covering his eyes. In these circumstances the opportunity for the complainants
to observe the intruders was extremely limited. It is also significant that
when the home invasion occurred it was dark and the ability of the family to
see the intruders was further compromised.</P></div>

<div class="paragWrapper"><div class="bootstrap unselectable viibes-marker-toolbox" data-with-parag="68" title="Paragraph tools"><div class="dropdown dropleft"><i data-toggle="dropdown" class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i><div class="dropdown-menu"></div></div></div><P class="MainParagraph" data-viibes-parag="68" data-viibes-start="67" data-viibes-end="66">[<A class="reflex-paragAnchor" name="par68">68</A>]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>Similarly, I do not place any weight on the fact
that no DNA or fingerprints were found which linked Mr. Chen to being inside
the home. We know that gloves were found in Room 242 of the hotel from Mr.
Bishop and Mr. Asare. DNA on these gloves linked both of those individuals to
the home invasion. No additional gloves were found but it is reasonable to
believe that all of the intruders wore latex gloves and in this scenario the
absence of a DNA link with Mr. Chen and Mr. Zhen is explained by the failure of
the police to find the gloves worn by Mr. Chen and Mr. Zhen, assuming that Mr.
Chen was one of the intruders.</P></div>

<div class="paragWrapper"><div class="bootstrap unselectable viibes-marker-toolbox" data-with-parag="69" title="Paragraph tools"><div class="dropdown dropleft"><i data-toggle="dropdown" class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i><div class="dropdown-menu"></div></div></div><P class="MainParagraph" data-viibes-parag="69" data-viibes-start="68" data-viibes-end="67">[<A class="reflex-paragAnchor" name="par69">69</A>]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>I do find it significant that prior to the home
invasion Mr. Chen was upstairs at the Comfort Inn. I infer that in the
26-minutes and 40-seconds that he was on the second floor of the hotel he was
in Room 242 together with Mr. Asare, Mr. Bishop and Mr. Zhen and that they were
meeting to discuss the proposed home invasion. I conclude on this basis that
Mr. Chen took part in the planning of the home invasion. I accept the defence
position that Mr. Chen&rsquo;s mere presence at the scene does not establish his
guilt or the fact that he was one of the intruders during the home invasion.
Nevertheless, it is a factor (and I consider it to be a significant one) that
following the planning meeting for the home invasion, Mr. Chen entered a
vehicle with the three other individuals who were involved in the home invasion
and that he was at the scene of the home invasion at the time it occurred. It
is also significant that arriving back at the Comfort Inn, Mr. Chen was
arrested in Room 242, together with two other individuals who can definitely be
linked to the home invasion.</P></div>

<div class="paragWrapper"><div class="bootstrap unselectable viibes-marker-toolbox" data-with-parag="70" title="Paragraph tools"><div class="dropdown dropleft"><i data-toggle="dropdown" class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i><div class="dropdown-menu"></div></div></div><P class="MainParagraph" data-viibes-parag="70" data-viibes-start="69" data-viibes-end="68">[<A class="reflex-paragAnchor" name="par70">70</A>]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>Taking all of these circumstances and evidence
into account, I have concluded that the only rational inference and the one I
draw is that Mr. Chen was actively engaged in the home invasion and entered the
home as one of four intruders. I reject the suggestion that he was an innocent
bystander who was simply on the scene at the time the home invasion occurred.
The suggestion that he might simply have changed his mind at the last minute
and refused to go into the house is in my view speculation, especially given
that after the four individuals returned to the hotel Mr. Chen accompanied them
back into Room 242. The Crown has therefore proved beyond a reasonable doubt
that Mr. Chen was one of the intruders who broke into the Leung home. At all
times Mr. Chen is seen on the video to be free of any interference from the
other intruders. I have therefore concluded that his actions were intentional
and voluntary.</P></div>

<div class="paragWrapper"><div class="bootstrap unselectable viibes-marker-toolbox" data-with-parag="71" title="Paragraph tools"><div class="dropdown dropleft"><i data-toggle="dropdown" class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i><div class="dropdown-menu"></div></div></div><P class="MainParagraph" data-viibes-parag="71" data-viibes-start="70" data-viibes-end="69">[<A class="reflex-paragAnchor" name="par71">71</A>]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</SPAN>I have concluded that the common purpose test
under s. 21(2) has been satisfied in this case by the Crown. I have concluded
that Mr. Chen formed an intention in common with the three other intruders to
carryout an unlawful purpose, namely to conduct an unlawful break in and that
he knew or ought to have known that the commission of the offences he is
charged with would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common
purpose. With respect to the assault on Ms. Wu, the evidence indicates that two
pistols were seized from Room 242 of the hotel. There is also evidence that two
knives were found as well as plastic zip ties in the hotel room. It is apparent
that in the planning of the home invasion it was anticipated that people would
be in the home and would have to be subdued with the probable result being an
assault which carried a probable risk of bodily injury. The purpose of the home
invasion was to steal property and cash from the home. Thus, the theft of property
(in this case a cellphone) and the use of a handgun to rob Calvin Leung must
have been directly contemplated. It must also have been directly contemplated
that the individuals in the home would have to be confined and that the home
would have to be subject to a break and enter in order to commit the indictable
offence of robbery.</P></div>
