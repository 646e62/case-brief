Prior to his death he had been engaged in an ongoing and bitter custody and access dispute with his former wife, the appellant, Melissa Merritt, relating to their two children. Previously, Caleb&rsquo;s parents, Bill Harrison, and Bridget Harrison, who had become embroiled in the custody dispute, also met untimely and sudden deaths in the same home where Caleb died, Bill on April 16, 2009, and Bridget on April 21, 2010.<A href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><SPAN style="font-size:13.0pt;font-family:

He was ultimately charged with first degree murder in all three deaths. At his trial, Mr. Fattore attempted to plead guilty of manslaughter in Caleb&rsquo;s death, but the Crown rejected his plea, and he was tried on charges of first degree murder relating to Caleb, Bridget, and Bill. There were significant questions relating to the cause of Bill&rsquo;s death, and Mr.&nbsp;Fattore was acquitted on that charge, but he was convicted of first degree murder in the deaths of Caleb and Bridget.</P></div>

She also argued that the trial judge erred in his jury instruction relating to the use, as circumstantial evidence of her guilt, of her omission to mention in two police statements that on a family mall visit the evening before Caleb&rsquo;s body was found, Mr. Fattore had gone to a Walmart store to purchase shoes (the &ldquo;Walmart omissions&rdquo;). Video evidence was subsequently presented at trial showing Mr.&nbsp;Fattore, alone, purchasing the shoes at the Walmart, as well as forensic evidence linking those shoes to Caleb&rsquo;s killing.</P></div>

They had two children together (the &ldquo;children&rdquo;). In 2005, after Caleb was charged with assaulting Ms. Merritt, they separated. Caleb moved in with Bill and Bridget. Ms. Merritt initially moved in with her parents but in 2006 she met Mr. Fattore and they quickly began cohabitating, having four children of their own by 2012.</P></div>

Caleb&rsquo;s parents became enmeshed in the custody dispute. Indeed, in the course of the ongoing litigation Ms. Merritt made a failed allegation against Bridget of abusing the children.</P></div>

However, in March of 2009 he was sentenced to 18-months imprisonment as the result of a conviction of impaired driving causing death. On March 18, 2009, the custody order was varied to provide Bill and Bridget with Caleb&rsquo;s parenting time while Caleb was incarcerated.</P></div>

There were no obvious signs of physical trauma other than a sternum fracture. Notwithstanding the sternum fracture, violence was cast into doubt as a cause of his death because there were no associated injuries, as one might expect if the injury to the sternum had occurred at the time of his death. His cause of death was therefore undetermined. The pathologist attributed Bill&rsquo;s death to &ldquo;acute cardiac arrythmia&rdquo;, a diagnosis of exclusion.</P></div>

On November 27, 2009, Ms. Merritt was arrested in Nova Scotia for abducting the children contrary to a court order, and the children were returned to Bridget.</P></div>

On April 21, 2010, before Caleb&rsquo;s application for sole custody was resolved, Bridget was found dead in her home. Bridget&rsquo;s body was found at the bottom of the main floor staircase. Her cause of death was determined to be from neck injuries sustained either by a fall down the stairs due to a medical event at the top of the stairs, or manual strangulation. There was no forensic evidence linking any suspects to Bridget&rsquo;s death. Expert witnesses who would later testify at the appellants&rsquo; trial disagreed on the likely mechanism of her death, with three of the four expert witnesses concluding that her death was caused by neck compression, with the remaining expert witness contending that Bridget likely died in a fall.</P></div>

Caleb had also sustained abrasions and bruises to his upper body and his right arm. There were signs of a struggle in the bedroom where he died, but no signs of forced entry.

She told the police that things had been fine between her and Caleb and that they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t even have to go to Family Court anymore&rdquo; but sort things out on their own outside of court. She recounted her movements with Mr. Fattore the evening before, on August 22, 2013, telling the police that they went to Subway and the Pita Pit at a mall after going to a softball game. As indicated above, Ms. Merritt did not mention that while they were at the mall, Mr. Fattore went to the Walmart to buy shoes that would later be linked forensically to Caleb&rsquo;s killing.

   <H2>Fattore Appeal: Did the trial judge err in finding Mr.&nbsp;Fattore&rsquo;s Post-Arrest statement to be voluntary?</H2>

Mr.&nbsp;Fattore claims that the trial judge erred in arriving at this conclusion. He also argued that the erroneous admission of the statement was a material error. He submitted that it played a critical role in his conviction for killing Bridget and contributed to the rejection of his trial testimony in which he gave an account of unintentionally killing Caleb, an account that if not rejected beyond a reasonable doubt would have led to a manslaughter rather than a murder conviction. He argued, as well, that the erroneous admission of his post-arrest statement influenced his decision to testify, requiring a new trial.</P></div>

He submitted that it is evident on the record that his choice to self&#8209;incriminate after more than eleven hours of resistance was caused by improper inducements being held out in oppressive circumstances. Specifically, he urged that Sgt. King improperly induced him to self-incriminate, after he was worn down from hours of interrogation, by exploiting his greatest vulnerability, his deep commitment to his blended family. He argued that shortly before his abrupt change from denying his guilt to confessing to two murders, Sgt. King had made clear that if he wanted to help Ms. Merritt so that she could gain her liberty and return to parenting their children he had to make the choice to accept the &ldquo;time limited offer&rdquo; to &ldquo;man up&rdquo; and take responsibility for the killings. He argued that in the face of this pressure, and in all of the circumstances, his choice to self&#8209;incriminate was not voluntary.</P></div>

The trial judge observed that despite the more than eleven hours that passed before Mr. Fattore admitted to the killings, he had remained engaged and &ldquo;was in full control of his faculties and abilities&rdquo;.</P></div>

The evidence before the trial judge supported each of these findings as well as the trial judge&rsquo;s finding that the only assurance Sgt. King gave was that those with decision-making power would consider any truthful and corroborated information provided by Mr. Fattore that might show that Ms. Merritt was less involved than the police thought.

He recognized explicitly that these comments were a &ldquo;problematic&rdquo; &ldquo;red flag&rdquo; that, in the context of the interview, &ldquo;raise[d] particular concern&rdquo;. However, he found that Mr. Fattore understood that in making these comments Sgt. King was not referring to a <EM>quid pro quo </EM>offer. Instead, Sgt. King was seeking to persuade Mr. Fattore in a &ldquo;common sense fashion&rdquo; that his ability to help Ms.&nbsp;Merritt would diminish if he waited until after the police interview to disclose information that Ms. Merritt&rsquo;s role in the killings was less than the police believed. As the trial judge put it, Sgt.

The trial judge&rsquo;s finding that the reference to a &ldquo;limited time offer&rdquo; did not relate to a <EM>quid pro quo </EM>promise is supported both by a contextual examination of the relevant exchanges, and by the fact that there was no evidence that Sgt.

He submitted that &ldquo;it is fanciful to find that [he] could collude with anyone&rdquo; and he pointed out that the police intercepts already raised concern that he and Ms. Merritt had been colluding about what they would tell the police. But these submissions miss the point. The material issue is not whether Sgt. King was correct in suggesting that an immediate statement would actually be more credible than a later one, or even whether Mr. Fattore was persuaded of this. The material question is whether, viewed objectively, Sgt. King offered Mr. Fattore a <EM>quid pro quo </EM>inducement.

It is therefore inadmissible. It follows that if a partially heard statement &ndash; in this case proof of an incomplete sentence &ndash; is admitted into evidence in a jury trial and the jury determines that there is insufficient context to give meaning to the words, the jury must disregard the partial or incomplete statement. After all, no jury can properly rely on evidence that is<EM> </EM>irrelevant and lacking in probative value. Jurors must therefore be provided with a direction that if they cannot determine the meaning of the partial or incomplete statement, they cannot use it as an admission and must disregard it.</P></div>

The Crown denied that those words could be heard, and never suggested that the words were audible. At no point did the trial judge suggest that they were.

Specifically, he submitted that the intercepted tapes as a whole show that she only learned of everything after the fact of the killings, and that the statement was made in a context in which Ms.&nbsp;Merritt had been expressing concern about her potential liability as an accessory after the fact.</P></div>

There was a very real possibility on the evidence before the jurors that they may not be able to do so.</P></div>

A sentence, of course, is a complete thought, and any clause or even a single word of a sentence can direct its meaning. Depending upon what the unintelligible words were, they were capable of changing entirely the meaning of &ldquo;the audio tapes would&rsquo;ve fucked us&rdquo;. By way of example only, if the &ldquo;unintelligible&rdquo; portion of the sentence indeed included the words, &ldquo;they think&rdquo;, then the airport intercept statement would not be an admission of guilt of anything. The missing words could well have played a central but unknown role in the meaning of the sentence. If the meaning of the words could not be heard or discerned from context or could not be determined from context to be unimportant, it would be arbitrary for jurors to rely on the words that could be heard.</P></div>

Ms. Merritt was suspected of complicity in three murders at the time and she was under arrest for two murders. Which murder charge or charges was she saying she believed she was &ldquo;fucked&rdquo; on? This mattered because unless jurors could relate the &ldquo;admission&rdquo; to a specific charge, it could not provide evidence against her at her trial.</P></div> 
   <div class="paragWrapper"><div class="bootstrap unselectable viibes-marker-toolbox" data-with-parag="101" title="Paragraph tools"><div class="dropdown dropleft"><i data-toggle="dropdown" class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i><div class="dropdown-menu"></div></div></div><P class="AParaNumbering" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in" data-viibes-parag="101" data-viibes-start="100" data-viibes-end="99">[<A class="reflex-paragAnchor" name="par101">101</A>]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>In addition, Ms. Merritt was not only at risk of criminal liability on the murder charges. She was also in jeopardy as an accessory after the fact, and there are compelling reasons to believe that if she was acknowledging guilt in the airport intercept statement, this is what she was referring to. It is not in dispute that the audio tapes Ms. Merritt was referring to in the airport intercept statement were the Nova Scotia audio tapes secured prior to her arrest. Those Nova Scotia audio tapes do not contain any admissions by her of guilt in any of the murders. This reduces materially the prospect that she was expressing concern in the airport intercept statement that those audio tapes disclose her complicity in any of the murders, let alone in Caleb&rsquo;s murder. What is in fact clearly established in the audio tapes she was referring to is that she was an accessory after the fact. Moreover, immediately before the airport intercept statement was uttered, Ms. Merritt and Mr.&nbsp;Fattore were discussing her jeopardy as an accessory after the fact, giving a context to the airport intercept statement that could cast significant doubt on its meaning.</P></div>

This made it gravely important for jurors to understand that if they could not hear the part of the statement marked &ldquo;unintelligible&rdquo; and could not determine the meaning of the airport intercept statement as a whole from its context, the partial or incomplete statement that they could hear could not be used as an admission of her guilt.</P></div>

He took the position that it was not necessary to do so because the overall context could be of some significance in assisting jurors to determine what was said in the inaudible portion of the statement. With respect, this response, reproduced in para. 90 above, missed the point of the objection. The trial judge answered an objection to the charge relating to what jurors should be told to do if they could not determine the meaning of the airport intercept statement from context, with the answer that jurors might be able to determine the meaning of the airport intercept from context. Even if there was a prospect that jurors could give meaning to an incomplete statement by relying on context, they still need to know how to proceed if they could not do so. This is not a case where the trial judge simply failed to give the required direction to jurors to ignore the evidence if unable to determine its meaning from context. He deliberately chose not to give that direction, and in my view, he did so for a mistaken reason.</P></div>

I am not persuaded of this, even though there are statements in the charge where the trial judge told jurors to assess the meaning of statements in context, and that &ldquo;only an accused person&rsquo;s words, as understood in context, can be used as evidence&rdquo;. Ordinarily this would arguably be enough to give jurors a functional understanding that they must disregard partial statements if they cannot determine their meaning. But not in this case. I make three points.</P></div>

In my view, the trial judge&rsquo;s general comments about interpreting what the accused said in context carries that ambiguity.</P></div>

As Rowe J. noted in <EM>Schneider</EM>, at para. 81, jurors are likely to give significant weight to confession-like evidence. In examining whether the statement in that case should be admitted as an admission he endorsed the utility of a &ldquo;strong caution&rdquo;. In my view, general directions by a trial judge, not linked specifically to the potentially problematic evidence, are not a strong caution and should not be relied upon to ameliorate the significant risk of prejudice that arises from the potential misuse of a partial statement that is being offered as an admission. In his jury charge, the trial judge should have given the proper analysis and the limitations on the use of the airport intercept statement dedicated attention but he did not do so.</P></div>

She did not tell the police that while the family was at a mall, Mr. Fattore went to the Walmart to purchase shoes. There is a transaction receipt and video evidence from the Walmart store showing Mr. Fattore doing so during a visit to the store that evening. There is also forensic evidence linking those shoes circumstantially to the killing, as well as proof of an attempt to dispose of the shoes.</P></div> 
   <div class="paragWrapper"><div class="bootstrap unselectable viibes-marker-toolbox" data-with-parag="123" title="Paragraph tools"><div class="dropdown dropleft"><i data-toggle="dropdown" class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i><div class="dropdown-menu"></div></div></div><P class="AParaNumbering" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in" data-viibes-parag="123" data-viibes-start="122" data-viibes-end="121">[<A class="reflex-paragAnchor" name="par123">123</A>]<SPAN style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>The Crown argued that Ms. Merritt&rsquo;s failures to tell the police about Mr.&nbsp;Fattore&rsquo;s purchase of the shoes were deliberate and that this deception constituted an attempt by her to hide her own complicity in Caleb&rsquo;s killing. There was a clear foundation in the Nova Scotia audio tapes for the Crown&rsquo;s contention that Ms.&nbsp;Merritt&rsquo;s statement did not include Mr. Fattore&rsquo;s Walmart shoe purchase because she intended to mislead the police, such that the omissions qualified in law as &ldquo;fabrications&rdquo;. Specifically, in the Nova Scotia audio tapes recorded after her police interviews, Ms. Merritt was overheard expressing apprehension about what she had told the police about the shoes and suggesting an alternative false account that she could have provided.</P></div>

He testified that he had acted alone in killing Caleb and only later told Ms. Merritt, and that this conversation occurred before she spoke to the police. If this were true, then Ms. Merritt&rsquo;s misleading omissions had to have been for the purpose of protecting him, and not herself. However, there were significant problems with the credibility of this affirmative evidence. It contradicted what Mr. Fattore had told Sgt.&nbsp;King during his post-arrest interview, namely that he did not tell Ms. Merritt that he had killed Caleb until after her police statements, and he had made a similar statement in the airport intercepts. There was therefore a realistic risk that the jury would reject Mr. Fattore&rsquo;s affirmative evidence and find there was no evidence affirmatively supporting the innocent possibility that Ms. Merritt misled the police by omitting the shoes to protect Mr.&nbsp;Fattore.</P></div>

   <P class="CQuote">Keep in mind that you may not use what Mr. Fattore said in his out-of-court statement to Sergeant King as evidence to prove that Ms. Merritt did not know about Mr.&nbsp;Fattore&rsquo;s involvement until August 27.

There are two related problems. First, it was an error for the trial judge to direct the jurors that they could reject the innocent accessory after-the-fact explanation if they rejected Mr.&nbsp;Fattore&rsquo;s testimony and found there to be no other direct evidence that Ms.&nbsp;Merritt was not involved in the crime but was merely acting as an accessory after-the-fact.

Yet the trial judge effectively invited jurors to reject the innocent accessory after the fact inference if there was no affirmative evidence supporting Ms. Merritt&rsquo;s position. To be sure, a jury should consider the absence of affirmative evidence supporting an innocent inference in deciding whether to reject it, but in my view, it is inconsistent with the presumption of innocence to invite a jury to reject an innocent inference unless such affirmative evidence exists.</P></div>

These directions relate to whether the Crown has met the standard of proof that applies to the jury&rsquo;s ultimate determination of guilt or innocence. It is settled law that this standard of proof does not apply to the admission or evaluation of after-the-fact conduct evidence: <EM>White</EM>, at paras. 38-41.

First, they would have to extrapolate that if they are to consider the absence of evidence in deciding the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence, they should do so, as well, in deciding whether to reject the innocent after-the-fact conduct inference. Second, they would have to conclude that they should ignore the trial judge&rsquo;s dedicated instruction that they could reject the innocent after&#8209;the&#8209;fact conduct evidence if it is not supported by affirmative evidence, but instead go further and consider whether there is an absence of sufficient evidence to draw the inculpatory inference. I appreciate that jurors must be credited with common sense, and that perfection is not required in jury directions, but I cannot accept that these elements of the charge would give jurors a functional understanding of the task at hand.</P></div>

The Crown had no direct evidence implicating Ms. Merritt, and, in my view, a properly instructed jury could be left with a reasonable doubt on the circumstantial evidence as to whether Ms. Merritt was an accessory after the fact to Caleb&rsquo;s murder, rather than a party to the killing. It is best that I not engage in a more detailed evaluation of the evidence to explain my thinking, given that I would set aside the conviction and order a retrial.</P></div>

&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">[4]</SPAN></SPAN></A> I pause to note that the &ldquo;audio tapes&rdquo; that Ms. Merritt was referring to in the airport intercept statement were the Nova Scotia audio tapes. None of those Nova Scotia audio tapes contain admissions of murder by Ms. Merritt, only statements showing that she was aware by the time those audio tapes were made that Mr.&nbsp;Fattore had killed Caleb and Bridget, and that she was actively assisting Mr. Fattore in overcoming the evidence that implicated him in the killings. In order to advance its theory that Ms. Merritt&rsquo;s partial comment that the &ldquo;audio tapes would&rsquo;ve fucked us anyways&rdquo; was a reference to she herself being &ldquo;fucked&rdquo; on the murder charges, the Crown was inviting jurors to speculate that she must have made other admissions relating to the murders that &ldquo;the police could have captured on the audio between her and Fattore&rdquo; but did not. There was no evidence of this. In my view, the Crown&rsquo;s suggestion that Ms. Merritt had made admissions of guilt that were not caught on the Nova Scotia audio tape amounted to unfair speculation and was highly prejudicial. I recognize that Ms. Merritt&rsquo;s trial counsel did not ask the trial judge for a direction to jurors not to speculate about whether such other admissions had been made, but the Crown&rsquo;s submission underscores the potential prejudicial impact that this evidence may have had on Ms. Merritt&rsquo;s trial.</P>

&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">[6]</SPAN></SPAN></A> The Crown had submitted that during the conversation in which the airport intercept statement was made, Mr. Fattore and Ms. Merritt were discussing a &ldquo;deal&rdquo; in which he would take the rap for both of them on the murder charges, with Ms. Merritt receiving only an accessory after the fact conviction, even though she too was complicit in the murders. This is the &ldquo;deal&rdquo; that the trial judge was referring to in this passage. The trial judge went on to review the evidence supporting the Crown position that this is what the conversation leading up to the airport intercept statement was about, as well as the evidence supporting Ms. Merritt&rsquo;s competing position that Mr. Fattore&rsquo;s attempt to take responsibility for the killings and his attempt to ensure that Ms. Merritt was prosecuted only as an accessory after the fact was not evidence that Ms. Merritt had been involved in the killings, but rather an accurate reflection of her actual culpability.</P>

    <P class="MsoFootnoteText" style="text-align:justify"><A href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7" title=""><SPAN class="MsoFootnoteReference"><SPAN style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">[7]</SPAN></SPAN></A> In my view, directions on after-the-fact conduct have nothing to do with the proper evaluation of the Crown&rsquo;s invitation to use the airport intercept statement as an admission of guilt because after-the-fact conduct and admissions of guilt are different kinds of evidence, calling for different modes of analysis. After-the-fact conduct evidence is circumstantial proof offered to support an inference that the accused must be guilty because they &ldquo;acted in a manner which, based on human experience and logic, is consistent with the conduct of a guilty person and inconsistent with the conduct of an innocent person&rdquo;: <I>R. v. White</I>, <A class="reflex3-caselaw" href="/en/ca/scc/doc/1998/1998canlii789/1998canlii789.html">1998 CanLII 789 (SCC)</A>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 72, at para. <A class="reflex-parag" href="/en/ca/scc/doc/1998/1998canlii789/1998canlii789.html#par19">19</A>, quoting <I>R. v. Peavoy</I>, (1997), <A class="reflex3-caselaw" href="/en/on/onca/doc/1997/1997canlii3028/1997canlii3028.html">1997 CanLII 3028 (ON CA)</A>, 34 O.R. (3d) 620, 117 C.C.C. (3d) 226 (C.A.), at p.&nbsp;238. The issue with after-the-fact conduct evidence is with the inferences that can reasonably be drawn. In contrast, an admission of guilt is direct evidence, since, by definition, direct evidence is evidence that if believed, resolves a matter in issue: <I>R. v. Villaroman</I>, <A class="reflex3-caselaw" href="/en/ca/scc/doc/2016/2016scc33/2016scc33.html">2016 SCC 33</A>, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 1000, at paras. <A class="reflex-parag" href="/en/ca/scc/doc/2016/2016scc33/2016scc33.html#par23">23-24</A>. A finding that Ms. Merritt made an admission of guilt, if believed, is a finding that she has directly acknowledged that the alleged charge is true. No inferences are needed to use an admission. The issue here is more basic: Can meaning be given to what the accused said, as an admission of guilt?</P>
