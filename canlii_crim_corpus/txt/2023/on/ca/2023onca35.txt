         The appellant appeals from his conviction on a charge of child luring. The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in rejecting his evidence that he honestly believed the complainant was 18 years of age.
         We do not accept this argument.
         It was acknowledged that the appellant had engaged in sexual communications with the complainant when she was 14 years of age for a period of over two years. This involved explicit sexual messages, photos, videos, and video-chats. The Crown was required to prove that the appellant knew that the complainant was under 18. The appellant’s defence was that he honestly believed that the complainant was 18 years of age.
         The trial judge properly applied the three-step W.D. approach. He rejected the appellant’s evidence, and specifically his evidence as to the nature of his relationship with the complainant and his claim that the complainant never told him her true age. The trial judge found the complainant’s evidence to be credible and that the appellant’s evidence did not leave him with a reasonable doubt. Critically, the trial judge found that the complainant told the appellant that she was 14 years old, and that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant knew she was under 18 years of age during the time he communicated with her.
         This finding precluded any possibility there was an air of reality that the appellant believed the complainant to be 18. The appellant invites this court to revisit the trial judge’s credibility findings, but that is not our role. The trial judge’s credibility findings were fully explained and are entitled to deference. The appellant has not established any basis for this court to interfere with them.
         The appeal is dismissed.
