The appeal filed in this case relates to a firearms prohibition order made by the Court of Québec, Criminal and Penal Division, pursuant to subsection 111(5) Cr.C.
        
The Crown seeks the summary dismissal of the appeal on the ground that it should have been filed with the Superior Court.
        
I agree. As per section 84 and subsection 111(8) Cr.C., an appeal from an order made pursuant to subsection 111(5) must be filed with the Superior Court. Moreover, subsection 685(2) Cr.C. empowers a judge of the Court to summarily dismiss an appeal that ought to have been filed with another court. FOR THESE REASONS, THE UNDERSIGNED:
        
GRANTS the motion to dismiss the appeal summarily;
        
DISMISSES the appeal.
