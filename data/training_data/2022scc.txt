2022 SCC 1

APPEAL from a judgment of the Alberta Court of Appeal (Paperny, Slatter and Veldhuis JJ.A.), 2020 ABCA 344, 17 Alta. L.R. (7th) 26, 394 C.C.C. (3d) 358, [2020] A.J. No. 1005 (QL), 2020 CarswellAlta 1746 (WL Can.), affirming the conviction of the accused for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. Appeal dismissed.

                    Wade Hlady, for the appellant.

                    Monique Dion, for the respondent.

                    The judgment of Moldaver, Brown, Rowe and Jamal JJ. was delivered orally by

[1]               Moldaver J. — Mr. Ali appeals as of right to this Court. A majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal affirmed his conviction for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. They found that the trial judge did not err in determining that the police’s strip search of Mr. Ali, incident to his lawful arrest, complied with s. 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in accordance with the principles governing strip searches set out by this Court in R. v. Golden, 2001 SCC 83, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 679.

[2]               A majority of this Court agrees with the conclusion of the majority of the Court of Appeal and would dismiss the appeal. Where a strip search is conducted as an incident to a person’s lawful arrest, there must be reasonable and probable grounds justifying the strip search, in addition to reasonable and probable grounds justifying the arrest (see Golden, at para. 99). These grounds are met for the strip search where there is some evidence suggesting the possibility of concealment of weapons or other evidence related to the reason for the arrest (see Golden, at paras. 94 and 111).

[3]               Like the majority of the Court of Appeal, we are satisfied that there were reasonable and probable grounds justifying the strip search: the police had confidential source information that their target was in possession of a large quantity of cocaine and that he kept most of his drugs on his person; Mr. Ali was found next to a table with drugs, other than cocaine, and with items consistent with drug trafficking, including a scale, money, and a ringing cell phone; Mr. Ali’s pants were partially down as he was being arrested; and one of the officers reported seeing Mr. Ali reaching towards the back of his pants. Viewed in its totality, this was clearly some evidence suggesting the possibility that Mr. Ali had concealed drugs, particularly cocaine, in and around the area of his buttocks.

[4]               We would not give effect to Mr. Ali’s argument that a hearsay error arose because the officer who requested the strip search, Cst. Darroch, testified that he was told by another officer, Cst. Odorski, that Mr. Ali was reaching towards the back of his pants, and Cst. Odorski did not refer to this in his testimony at trial. Mr. Ali now concedes that Cst. Darroch’s testimony was not inadmissible hearsay because it was not entered for the truth of its contents; the question, he maintains, was whether Cst. Darroch could reasonably rely on the information from Cst. Odorski as a factor in deciding whether he had reasonable and probable grounds to request the strip search. Defence counsel chose not to cross‑examine either officer about this information. It stood uncontradicted. This tactical choice undermines Mr. Ali’s submission that it was unreasonable for Cst. Darroch to rely on Cst. Odorski’s information.

[5]               For these reasons, we would dismiss the appeal.

                    The following are the reasons delivered orally by

[6]               Côté J. — I agree with the majority’s disposition of the appeal, but for different reasons.

[7]               In my view, the respondent Crown failed to discharge its burden of establishing the legal basis for the strip search of Mr. Ali in accordance with the principles set out by this Court in Golden. As such, I find that Mr. Ali’s s. 8 Charter rights were violated, substantially for the reasons of Veldhuis J.A., at paras. 27‑61.

[8]               However, I part ways with Veldhuis J.A. with respect to the proper remedy. Relying on Golden, at paras. 118‑19, Mr. Ali argues that this Court should substitute an acquittal because conducting an analysis under s. 24(2) of the Charter would be a mere theoretical exercise.

[9]               I disagree. As in Golden, I acknowledge that Mr. Ali has already served his custodial sentence. Nevertheless, he remains subject to restrictions to his liberty, including a firearms prohibition and a DNA order. As such, determining whether the evidence ought to be admitted will have tangible consequences, both for Mr. Ali and for the public.

[10]            Moreover, the facts of this case are plainly distinguishable from Golden. The strip search in Golden was coercive and forceful, conducted in a public area without authorization from a senior officer, and may have jeopardized the accused’s health and safety. The search of Mr. Ali has none of these characteristics. It is undisputed that it was conducted in a reasonable manner. In my view, it is worthwhile to assess whether admitting evidence obtained as a result of the Charter breach would do further damage to the repute of the justice system.

[11]            I further acknowledge that, as the courts below found no breach of s. 8 in this case, they did not consider whether the evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2). However, I accept the Crown’s submission that the record before this Court is sufficient to determine whether the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Therefore, I see no utility in sending the matter back for redetermination. In these circumstances, it is open to this Court to conduct its own first‑instance s. 24(2) analysis (R. v. Spencer, 2014 SCC 43, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 212, at para. 75).

[12]            Applying the three lines of inquiry from R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, I would not exclude the evidence.

[13]            First, the seriousness of the police conduct in this case was at the lowest end of the spectrum. Cst. Darroch believed in good faith that he had the requisite grounds to strip search Mr. Ali. He relayed his grounds to his superior officer, who authorized the search at the police station. I see no basis to suggest that the police wilfully disregarded Mr. Ali’s Charter rights. This factor favours admission.

[14]            Second, the impact of the strip search on Mr. Ali’s privacy interests, while serious, was somewhat attenuated by the reasonable manner in which it was conducted. At trial, counsel for Mr. Ali noted the search was “as humane as possible given the circumstances” (trial transcript, A.R., at p. 173). In my view, this factor tips only moderately in favour of exclusion.

[15]            The final Grant inquiry strongly favours admission. Mr. Ali was in possession of 65 grams of crack cocaine. The Crown would have no case without this evidence. There is a strong societal interest in adjudicating this case on its merits.

[16]            On balance, I conclude that excluding the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. To be clear, I would emphatically re‑affirm the principles arising from Golden and the high threshold the Crown must meet to justify a warrantless strip search. However, while the Crown failed to meet that threshold in this case, the conduct of the police did not undermine the integrity of the justice system. Therefore, I would not exclude the evidence.

[17]            For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal and affirm the conviction.

                    Judgment accordingly.


2022 SCC 2

APPEAL from a judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal (Chamberland, Moore and Cournoyer JJ.A.), 2021 QCCA 815, [2021] AZ‑51766617, [2021] J.Q. no 5447 (QL), 2021 CarswellQue 6162 (WL Can.), affirming a decision of Garneau J.C.Q., 2019 QCCQ 16135, [2019] AZ‑51770107, [2019] J.Q. no 27825 (QL), 2019 CarswellQue 18799 (WL Can.). Appeal dismissed.

                    Jason Vocelle Lévesque and Jade Coderre, for the appellant.

                    Nicholas St‑Jacques and Lida Sara Nouraie, for the respondent.

                    English version of the judgment of the Court delivered orally by

[1]               Kasirer J. — The Crown appeals from a majority decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal upholding, in favour of the respondent, a stay of proceedings entered because of the violation of his constitutional right to be tried within a reasonable time. The majority found a net delay of 35 months and 2 days (1,066 days), which exceeds the ceiling set in R. v. Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631.

[2]               The issue in the appeal is whether two particular delays — a first period of 84 days and a second of 112 days — must be attributed to the defence because of its conduct.

[3]               With regard to the period of 84 days, we agree with Chamberland J.A., dissenting in the Court of Appeal, that the delay between March 1 and May 24, 2018 resulted from illegitimate defence conduct and must therefore be attributed to the respondent.

[4]               It is true that the characterization of delay is a question of law and that the trial judge was not bound by the respondent’s admission in this regard. However, the trial judge did not provide any explanation, even an implicit one, to clarify why he was rejecting the admission for this period (reasons of Chamberland J.A., at para. 173). Since he chose to go against the parties’ suggestion, and in the absence of submissions by them on this specific point, it was especially important that the trial judge provide reasons explaining what he had decided and why (see R. v. G.F., 2021 SCC 20, at paras. 71‑74). With respect, he did not do so.

[5]               Moreover, as the dissenting judge suggested, it is not sufficient that the step taken by the respondent be legitimate for the delay not to be attributable to him. In this case, it is the manner in which the defence conducted itself with respect to its motion for an unredacted copy of the information that was illegitimate, particularly because of how late that motion was brought. It was not until 15 months after being given the redacted document that the defence decided to bring its motion, even though the parties had already been debating the redaction of other documents for several months (reasons of Chamberland J.A., at paras. 179‑84, properly relying in particular on R. v. Rice, 2018 QCCA 198, at para. 60 (CanLII); see also R. v. Cody, 2017 SCC 31, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 659, at para. 32).

[6]               In the circumstances, the entire 84‑day delay between March 1 and May 24, 2018 is attributable to the defence. The motion for an unredacted copy of the information in support of the search warrant and the motion challenging the warrant itself were intrinsically connected, since, according to the defence, it was not possible to hear the challenge to the warrant without settling the debate over redaction. By delaying the filing of the motion for an unredacted copy of the information, the respondent necessarily delayed the hearing on the challenge to the warrant. He must therefore be held responsible for the delay between the day he raised the issue of an unredacted copy of the information (March 1, 2018) and the day the motion challenging the warrant was finally to be heard (May 24, 2018).

[7]               With regard to the second period in issue, namely the period of 112 days between May 21 and September 10, 2019, the Crown’s ground of appeal must be dismissed. The majority was correct to intervene, because this delay could not be attributed entirely to the respondent despite the fact that his counsel was unavailable on certain dates.

[8]               This Court did of course explain in Jordan that where the court and the Crown are ready to proceed but the defence is not, the resulting delay is attributable to the defence (para. 64). All participants in the criminal justice system, including the defence, must take a proactive approach in order to prevent unnecessary delay by targeting its root causes (Cody, at para. 36). That being said, in some cases, the circumstances may justify apportioning responsibility for delay among these participants rather than attributing the entire delay to the defence.

[9]               Here, the parties had asked the judge as early as November 2018 to add a third trial date to the two dates already scheduled in January 2019. Their request was denied. On the first day of the trial in January 2019, it became clear that the two scheduled dates would not be enough, in part because of the prosecution’s changes in strategy. Even though they discussed potential dates for the continuation of the trial and counsel for the respondent informed the judge and the prosecution that she would be unavailable on certain dates in May 2019, the judge proposed and insisted on a date in September 2019 without considering the possibility of continuing the trial on an earlier date when both parties were available. The judge had therefore known since November 2018 that an additional day would be needed, and in January 2019, when he was assessing potential availability for the continuation of the trial, proximity to the Jordan ceilings had to be taken into consideration (R. v. K.G.K., 2020 SCC 7, at para. 61). That being said, it was not until August 7, 2019 that the respondent informed the prosecution of his intention to file a motion under s. 11(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Therefore, in addition to the conduct of defence counsel and the prosecution’s changes in strategy, it was because of institutional delay and the court’s lack of initiative that no other date was offered sooner (reasons of Cournoyer J.A., at para. 148).

[10]            In the particular circumstances of this case, we are of the view that it is “fair and reasonable” to apportion responsibility for the 112‑day delay and to attribute up to half of the delay between June 1, 2019 (the day after the last date on which counsel for the respondent was unavailable) and September 10, 2019 (the actual date on which the trial continued) to the defence (R. v. K.J.M., 2019 SCC 55, at para. 96). Even calculating from this premise, since the total delay between these two dates is 101 days, we attribute 51 days (June 1 to July 22, 2019) to the defence. A delay of 10 days (between May 21 and 31, 2019) should also be attributed to the respondent given the concession he made in the Court of Appeal (reasons of Cournoyer J.A., at para. 150, fn. 83).

[11]            In the end, in addition to the period identified by the majority of the Court of Appeal, a delay of 84 days (period of March 1 to May 24, 2018) and a delay of 61 days (from May 21 to 31, 2019 and from June 1 to July 22, 2019) are attributable to the defence. This brings the total number of days attributable to the defence to 225, and the net delay to 950 days, or more than 31 months. The 30‑month Jordan ceiling has therefore been exceeded and the delay is presumed to be unreasonable. No exceptional circumstance has been raised to justify exceeding the ceiling.

[12]            It should be noted that the respondent was charged in June 2016, close to the date on which the decision in Jordan was rendered. The expectation today is that such a situation would not happen again.

[13]            For these reasons, the Court dismisses the appeal and upholds the stay of proceedings entered by the trial judge.

                    Judgment accordingly.

                    English version of the judgment of the Court delivered orally by

[1]               Kasirer J. — The Crown appeals from a judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal quashing four convictions and entering a stay of proceedings in favour of the respondents because of a violation of their right to be tried within a reasonable time. The appellant asks that the stay of proceedings be set aside and that the case be remanded to the Court of Appeal for a decision on the nine grounds of appeal that it chose not to address, as it found it unnecessary to do so in the circumstances.

[2]               On September 14, 2009, the respondents were charged with laundering proceeds of crime, conspiracy and criminal organization offences. In 2014 and 2015, they filed motions for a stay of proceedings under ss. 11(b) and 24(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. On September 17, 2015, before this Court rendered its decision in R. v. Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631, the Court of Québec dismissed the motions, finding that a stay of proceedings was not an appropriate remedy. Because the judge found a 77‑month delay between the charges and the anticipated end of the trial, he held that s. 11(b) of the Charter had been infringed. However, he declined to enter a stay of proceedings on the ground that the accused had not been prejudiced by the delay. On this point, the judge held that [translation] “there is as much prejudice resulting from the charge, and not from the unreasonable delay”, and that there was a “clear and compelling” societal interest in having the accused stand trial (Court of Québec reasons, A.R., vol. I, at p. 60). The judgment of conviction was rendered on June 22, 2016.

[3]               In the Court of Appeal’s view, the judge had no choice but to enter a stay of proceedings after finding an infringement of s. 11(b) (citing R. v. Rahey, 1987 CanLII 52 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 588). The Court of Appeal declined to review the trial judge’s reasons concerning the infringement of s. 11(b), finding that the appeal record was not sufficiently complete to permit it to determine whether the judge’s assessment of the delays was inadequate or wrong.

[4]               In this Court, the Crown acknowledges that the trial judge made an error, but it takes the view that the error was not determinative of the outcome. It argues that the Court of Appeal erred in entering a stay of proceedings in reliance on the trial judge’s erroneous and premature conclusion that s. 11(b) had been infringed.

[5]               With respect, the trial judge erred in assessing the prejudice suffered by the accused at the remedy stage rather than considering it in determining whether s. 11(b) had been infringed, in accordance with the criteria applicable at the time set out in R. v. Morin, 1992 CanLII 89 (SCC), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 771. Despite that error, however, a functional analysis of his reasons shows that he considered the relevant factors and reached the correct conclusion, namely that the motions for a stay of proceedings should be dismissed. Although he was mistaken about the stage of the analysis at which prejudice had to be considered, his refusal to enter a stay of proceedings nonetheless makes it possible to conclude that s. 11(b) was not infringed based on the Morin criteria. The Court of Appeal failed to make this finding (paras. 17‑18).

[6]               In the circumstances, we are all of the view that the Court of Appeal erred in entering the stay of proceedings that the judge had himself denied.

[7]               With respect, the Court of Appeal erred in refusing to re‑examine the unreasonableness of the delays on the ground that the record before it was incomplete. On appeal, the Crown filed a statement of admissions by the parties — filed by the parties at trial under s. 655 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 — that contained a detailed chronology of events, the content of which was not analyzed at all by the Court of Appeal. In our opinion, the evidence in the record allowed the appeal judges to carry out that analysis. It should be noted that a statement of admissions by the parties was not part of the appeal records in the cases on which the Court of Appeal relied, at para. 14 of its reasons, to justify its refusal to re‑examine the delays in this case. Although a court is not bound by admissions of law, a joint statement may be useful on appeal and may help reduce the delays leading to the infringement alleged by an accused (see, e.g., R. v. Bryant, 2021 QCCA 1807, at para. 3).

[8]               The evidence in the record shows that the respondents directly caused most of the delays of which they complain and that they attempted to derail the trial by filing multiple applications, motions and interlocutory appeals, which were unsuccessful for the most part. These delays are largely but not exclusively attributable to the defence and must be subtracted from the total delay.

[9]               The respondents also caused additional delays by insisting that a certain lawyer represent them despite a clear conflict of interest. In 2011, the preliminary inquiry judge found that Mélanie and Dax Ste‑Marie could not be represented by the same lawyer. As a result, they represented themselves. Despite the conflict of interest, they continued to insist that the lawyer retained by their father, Michel Ste‑Marie, represent all three of them. They maintained that position for more than two years. That course of conduct was of course untenable and caused additional delay.

[10]            We reach the same conclusion with respect to Richard Felx. Although the conflict of interest did not directly involve him, he never expressed concern about the delays caused by his co‑accused. Moreover, the prosecution offered him his own preliminary inquiry several times, but he always refused.

[11]            Jordan reaffirmed the principle, which is applicable in this case, that the defence should not be allowed to benefit from its own delay‑causing conduct or from its tactics aimed at causing delay (paras. 60 and 63; see Morin, at p. 802; R. v. Askov, 1990 CanLII 45 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1199, at pp. 1227‑28).

[12]            The appellant argues that once the deductions are made, the net delay is 35 months at the most (A.F., at para. 41). The respondents Mélanie Ste‑Marie, Dax Ste‑Marie and Richard Felx refer to this same calculation in their factum (R.F., at para. 37).

[13]            Assuming for the sake of argument that the residual delay exceeds the ceiling set in Jordan, the presumption of unreasonableness may be rebutted on the basis of the transitional exceptional circumstance (Jordan, at paras. 96‑97). The transitional exceptional circumstance may apply where it is shown that “the time the case has taken is justified based on the parties’ reasonable reliance on the law as it previously existed” (R. v. Cody, 2017 SCC 31, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 659, at para. 68). In R. v. Rice, 2018 QCCA 198, at para. 202 (CanLII), Vauclair J.A. noted that, for this purpose, the court may examine the conduct of the accused: [translation] “[t]he absence of haste is an indicator of the lack of concern the accused has for delays and may be helpful in assessing prejudice”. This is in line with the factual determination made by the trial judge in this case, who found that the prejudice complained of by the respondents did not result from delay. In this situation, in light of the transitional exceptional circumstance identified in Jordan, it should be concluded that s. 11(b) of the Charter was not infringed and that the trial judge was right to dismiss the motions for a stay of proceedings.

[14]            For these reasons, we would allow the appeal, set aside the stay of proceedings and remand the case to a new panel of the Quebec Court of Appeal for consideration of the other grounds of appeal that remain outstanding.

                    Judgment accordingly.


2022 SCC 4

The appeals from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Alberta (Calgary), Numbers 1901-0142A and 1901-0143A, 2021 ABCA 172, dated May 12, 2021, were heard on February 15, 2022, and the Court on that day delivered the following judgment orally:

Moldaver J. — We would dismiss the appeals and uphold A.E. and T.C.F.’s convictions for sexual assault. The trial judge erred in law, in that he essentially applied a principle of “broad advance consent” (R. v. Barton, 2019 SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579, at para. 99). Consent must be linked to the sexual activity in question, it must exist at the time the activity occurs, and it can be withdrawn at any time (Barton, at para. 88; R. v. Hutchinson, 2014 SCC 19, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 346, at para. 17). The trial judge failed to address the scope of the complainant’s consent to sexual activity and failed to consider whether her consent was withdrawn. Accordingly, the trial judge’s determination that the complainant had subjectively consented to the sexual activity in question was not entitled to deference.

As this Court set out in R. v. Cassidy, 1989 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 345, in order to substitute a conviction on an appeal from acquittal, “all the findings necessary to support a verdict of guilty must have been made, either explicitly or implicitly, or not be in issue” (pp. 354-55). The Cassidy test is met in this case, thereby permitting a substituted conviction under s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. The trial judge’s explicit and implicit findings demonstrate that both A.E. and T.C.F. continued, and A.E. escalated the sexual interactions with the complainant even after she cried out “No”, without taking any steps to find out if she was withdrawing her consent. Specifically, A.E. slapped the complainant’s buttocks, and T.C.F. continued to engage the complainant in sexual activity and ordered her to perform fellatio. In the circumstances, T.C.F.’s assertion of an honest but mistaken belief in consent lacks an air of reality and is unsupported by any reasonable steps (Criminal Code, s. 273.2(b); Barton, at para. 122). Finally, in view of our conclusion that the Cassidy test is met here, we need not comment on Martin J.A.’s statement of the test for substituted convictions, found at para. 91 of his reasons.

With respect to the allegations of bias raised by A.E., we are all of the view that nothing asserted by him called into any question the integrity and impartiality of the Court of Appeal of Alberta in this case.

The appellant A.E. also asks this Court to stay his conviction for sexual assault under Kienapple v. The Queen, 1974 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729, on the basis that it is a lesser included count within his conviction for sexual assault with a weapon. We would not give effect to this submission. In these circumstances, the offences involve different subsets of facts and address different forms of harm (see R. v. M. (R.), 2020 ONCA 231, 150 O.R. (3d) 369, at para. 52). Specifically, the charge of sexual assault with a weapon addresses the injuries that the complainant suffered as a result of the use of the toothbrush, as well as the elevated risk that it brought about.

We note that the Court of Appeal of Alberta addressed other issues in obiter, including: T.C.F.’s liability for sexual assault with a weapon; whether surreptitious recording constitutes fraud vitiating consent; and whether consent to sexual activity can be given in situations involving intentional bodily harm. In the circumstances, it is unnecessary for us to address these issues.

In the result, the appeals from conviction are dismissed and the matters are remitted to the Court of Queen’s Bench for sentencing.

2022 SCC 5

The appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Quebec (Montreal), Number 500-10-007001-199, 2021 QCCA 783 , dated May 12, 2021, was heard on March 15, 2022 and the Court has pronounced orally on the same day the following judgment:

The Chief Justice — The Crown is appealing as of right a decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal. He argues that the majority judges overstepped their appellate role by reassessing the evidence without, however, identifying any error in the trial judge's reasoning.

The accused claims to have acted in self-defence pursuant to s . 34 of the Criminal Code , RSC 1985, c. C-46 . As our Court recently recalled in R. v. Khill , 2021 SCC 37 , three components must be present in order for the accused to successfully raise this defence: (1) the catalyst; (2) motive; and (3) reaction (para. 51).

The trial judge rejected the self-defence argument. She is of the view that the second criterion of this defense is not met. She does not believe that the accused used force to defend himself or to protect himself against the use or threat of use of force. On the contrary, it concludes, in light of its assessment of the evidence, that he acted out of revenge. It therefore finds the accused guilty of aggravated assault, assault with a weapon and possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace.

The majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the accused's appeal, quashed the guilty verdicts and ordered a new trial on the ground that the trial judge's analysis of the second criterion of self-defence instance was wrong.

Justice Bachand, dissenting, would have dismissed the appeal instead. Finding that the trial judge's conclusion was supported by the evidence, he concluded that her conclusion was reasonable and entitled to deference.

We are all of the opinion that the majority of the Court of Appeal erred in intervening in this case and we share in part the reasons of Judge Bachand.

When a verdict is rendered by a judge sitting alone, there are two grounds on which an appellate court may be justified in intervening when the verdict is unreasonable, namely (1) when the verdict cannot be supported by the evidence; or (2) where the verdict is flawed due to illogical or irrational reasoning ( R. v. Beaudry , 2007 SCC 5 , [2007] 1 SCR 190; R. v. Sinclair , 2011 SCC 40 , [2011] 3 SCR 3).

Although an unreasonable verdict is a question of law, the assessment of credibility is a question of fact ( R. v. RP ., 2012 SCC 22 , [2012] 1 SCR 746, at para. 10 ). The trial judge's assessment of the credibility of witnesses can only be set aside where it "cannot be supported by any reasonable interpretation of the evidence" (R. v. Burke, 1996 CanLII 229 ( SCC) , [1996] 1 SCR 474, para 7). As Justice Bachand rightly points out, the issue in this case was therefore not to know "whether the conclusion that [the accused] acted out of revenge is the only one that the judge could reasonably draw in view of the evidence adduced”, but rather “to know whether this conclusion finds sufficient support in the evidence and whether it is free from palpable and overriding error” (para. 58, citing Beaudry ). Justice Bachand completed his statement by emphasizing that the trial judge could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent had acted out of revenge and not for the purpose of defending himself.

We are all of the opinion that the majority of the Court of Appeal failed to consider the trial judge's privileged position in assessing the evidence (see Beaudry , at para. 62 ). She criticizes him for having failed to consider certain pieces of evidence without, however, clearly identifying any manifest and decisive error in his analysis. However, "[t]he mere fact that the trial judge did not analyze in depth a given point or a particular piece of evidence does not constitute a sufficient reason to justify the intervention of the appellate courts" ( Housen v. Nikolaisen , 2002 SCC 33 , [2002] 2 SCR 235, para 72 ). The majority could not simply substitute its opinion for that of the trial judge on the assessment of the credibility of witnesses ( R. v. Gagnon , 2006 SCC 17 , [2006] 1 SCR 621, at para. 23 ). Absent a reviewable error, she should have shown deference.

Nor could the majority of the Court of Appeal hold that the trial judge's finding on the second test of self-defence was “tainted by flawed underlying reasoning” (para. 54). A verdict may be characterized as unreasonable when it is based on illogical or irrational reasoning, for example when the trial judge draws a conclusion essential to the verdict, but which is inconsistent with the evidence not contradicted and not rejected by the trial judge. trial ( Beaudry , at para. 98 ; Sinclair , at para. 21). Here, the trial judge's inference from the evidence is not inconsistent with the evidence adduced. His approach is, on the contrary, consistent and based on uncontradicted and undismissed evidence. There was no room for intervention.

For these reasons, we are all of the opinion to allow the appeal, to restore the verdicts of guilt pronounced by the Court of Quebec and to order the respondent Daniel Brunelle to surrender to the prison authorities within 72 hours of this judgment.

                  Karakatsanis and Brown JJ. —

I.               Introduction

[1]                              In British Columbia (Minister of Forests) v. Okanagan Indian Band, 2003 SCC 71, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 371, this Court established a framework for assessing claims for advance costs to offset the anticipated litigation expenses of public interest litigants. Among its requirements was that an applicant demonstrate impecuniosity — meaning, that it “genuinely cannot afford to pay for the litigation” (para. 40).

[2]                              This appeal concerns an application for advance costs by Beaver Lake Cree Nation to fund its litigation under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. A band within the meaning of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I‑5, Beaver Lake has about 1,200 members, approximately 450 of whom live on a reserve located near Lac La Biche, Alberta. In 2008, band chief Germaine Anderson sued on her own behalf and as a representative of all Beaver Lake Cree Nation beneficiaries of Treaty No. 6 and of Beaver Lake Cree Nation (collectively, Beaver Lake).

[3]                              While contending that it is “impecunious”, Beaver Lake has access to resources — both assets and income — that could potentially be applied to fund this litigation. Beaver Lake says, however, that these resources must be applied to address other priorities. The issue to be decided here, then, is how the requirement of impecuniosity applies in this circumstance. That is, we must consider how a First Nation government applicant may demonstrate impecuniosity where it has access to resources that could fund litigation, but says it must devote those resources to other priorities.

[4]                              We conclude that a First Nation government that has access to resources may meet the impecuniosity requirement if it demonstrates that it requires such resources to meet its pressing needs. While the impecuniosity requirement is guided by the condition of necessity, pressing needs are not defined by the bare necessities of life. Rather, and in keeping with the imperative of reconciliation, they ought to be understood from the perspective of that First Nation government. A court may therefore consider the broader context in which a First Nation government sets priorities and makes financial decisions, accounting for competing spending commitments, restrictions on the uses of its resources, and fiduciary and good governance obligations. It follows that, in appropriate cases, a First Nation government may succeed in demonstrating impecuniosity despite having access to resources whose value equals or exceeds its litigation costs.

[5]                              All this said, the threshold of impecuniosity remains high and is not easily met. Bearing in mind the constraints on the judicial role imposed by the separation of powers, the extraordinary nature of the remedy and the importance of accountability for the expenditure of public funds it entails, the court’s analysis must be firmly grounded in the evidence. The court must be able to (1) identify the applicant’s pressing needs; (2) determine what resources are required to meet those needs; (3) assess the applicant’s financial resources; and (4) identify the estimated costs of funding the litigation. This approach is sufficiently flexible to account for the realities facing First Nations governments and the importance of furthering the goal of reconciliation while adhering to the appropriate judicial role.

[6]                              Despite finding that Beaver Lake had, at the time of its application, more than $3 million in unrestricted funds and additional ongoing revenue that could be used to pay for its legal fees, the case management judge held that it was — given the impoverished state of the community and the other needs it was required to meet — impecunious and awarded Beaver Lake advance costs (2019 ABQB 746). The Court of Appeal of Alberta reversed, holding that there was insufficient evidence to support that conclusion (2020 ABCA 238, 448 D.L.R. (4th) 555).

[7]                              In our respectful view, the case management judge erred in her impecuniosity analysis. While her finding that Beaver Lake is an impoverished community with pressing needs is unassailable, her findings were insufficient to conclude that Beaver Lake had satisfied the legal test for impecuniosity.

[8]                              The matter of Beaver Lake’s impecuniosity, however, should be reconsidered in light of the reasons that follow, and to account for the passage of time which will likely have altered Beaver Lake’s current financial state. We would therefore allow the appeal and remit the matter to the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta.

II.            Background

[9]                              Beaver Lake’s underlying claim, in essence, is that the Crown “improperly allowed lands traditionally used by Beaver Lake Cree Nation to be ‘taken up’ for industrial and resource development” thereby “compromis[ing] [its] ability . . . to pursue its traditional way of life” (C.A. reasons, at para. 2). It seeks various declarations of right, injunctions, and damages or equitable compensation.

[10]                          In support of its application, Beaver Lake says that the cost of litigation — which it estimated as $5 million — is well beyond its reach. By the time Beaver Lake’s application was heard, it had already spent approximately $3 million on legal fees, paid from its own funds and from third party fundraising. A 120‑day trial is presently scheduled to begin in January 2024.

[11]                          Citing Okanagan and Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada (Commissioner of Customs and Revenue), 2007 SCC 2, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 38, the case management judge correctly stated the test for awarding advance costs — that an applicant must demonstrate impecuniosity, present a prima facie meritorious case and raise issues of public importance — and recognized that her decision is ultimately discretionary. Canada and Alberta conceded for the purposes of this application that Beaver Lake’s case was prima facie meritorious. And, the case management judge found that the public importance requirement was satisfied, since Beaver Lake’s case raised a novel issue regarding the interpretation of Aboriginal and treaty rights.

[12]                          As to impecuniosity, the case management judge found that Beaver Lake’s financial situation had improved in recent years. It was not under any imminent threat of insolvency or third party or co‑management, its recent financial statements showed a surplus, and it had been able to spend $3 million in legal fees for the litigation (averaging $300,000 each year). After reviewing Beaver Lake’s resources — including government funding for a variety of programs, Impact Benefit Agreements negotiated with industry and miscellaneous revenue streams such as third party fundraising — she determined that Beaver Lake had access to “more than $3 million” in unrestricted funds that could potentially finance its litigation (para. 60 (CanLII)).

[13]                          The case management judge also observed, however, that Beaver Lake has “substantial deficits in housing and infrastructure and . . . high levels of unemployment and social assistance” (para. 30). Relying on the evidence of band council and community members, she held that Beaver Lake was an impoverished community with many pressing needs and concluded that it was impecunious because it “cannot fund the litigation at the rate required to bring it to trial” (para. 63). In the result, she found it appropriate to award advance costs. Beaver Lake, she said, should not have “to choose between pursuing this litigation and attempting to provide for the basic necessities of life” (para. 66). Each of Beaver Lake, Canada and Alberta would therefore contribute $300,000 annually to the credit of Beaver Lake’s legal fees until the trial was concluded or litigation was otherwise resolved.

[14]                          The Court of Appeal allowed Canada’s and Alberta’s appeals and set aside the case management judge’s order. The case management judge erred, it held, in concluding that Beaver Lake was impecunious. Her finding that Beaver Lake had more than $3 million in unrestricted funds alone signified that Beaver Lake “prima facie did not meet the legal test” (C.A. reasons, at para. 17). It was an error in principle to conclude that Beaver Lake was impecunious when it had financial resources, but chose to spend them on other priorities. Distinguishing “discretionary spending on desirable improvements to community infrastructure and standards of living” from “spending on basic necessities”, it held that an applicant is impecunious only where its expenditures on matters in the latter category render it genuinely unable to pay for the litigation (para. 28). Here, no evidence supported the case management judge’s finding that Beaver Lake would have to choose between spending on basic necessities and pursuing the litigation.

[15]                          Before the Court of Appeal, Canada tendered fresh evidence that Beaver Lake had received $2.97 million in settlement of a specific claim. The Court of Appeal therefore held that, in light of this evidence and of the case management judge’s findings, and accounting for her errors in principle in disregarding certain assets that were available to Beaver Lake, Beaver Lake had at least $6 to 7 million to fund the litigation. Further, it said that the advance costs order was “unreasonable”, since it failed to adequately balance the parties’ interests, the quantum of the award was not justified on the record, and the order did not include adequate procedural controls.

III.         Analysis

[16]                          Our analysis proceeds as follows. First, we review the test and underlying principles governing awards for advance costs in public interest litigation. Secondly, we consider the impecuniosity requirement of that test, and how it applies to a First Nation government that has access to financial resources that could potentially pay for its litigation. Finally, we apply the framework to illustrate how, we say respectfully, the case management judge erred in her assessment of impecuniosity in this case.

[17]                          Beaver Lake submits that whether a First Nation government is impecunious must be informed by broad contextual factors and the unique realities of First Nations, including the government’s obligations to its community and the reasonable financial decisions it makes on matters besides litigation. An approach to impecuniosity that focuses exclusively on an applicant’s available financial resources is contrary to the objective of reconciliation inherent in s. 35 litigation. In any event, spending on Beaver Lake’s housing and infrastructure deficits is not just a reasonable financial decision, but a basic need that should take priority over funding the litigation.

[18]                          Alberta and Canada each submit that, given Beaver Lake’s access to significant assets and revenues, it was not impecunious. While Alberta agrees that the test for impecuniosity is not one of “unqualified impecuniosity” (C.A. reasons, at para. 25), Beaver Lake did not provide sufficient contextual evidence identifying or costing its basic needs or demonstrating that it was using its unrestricted financial resources to address those needs. Alberta acknowledges that the goal of reconciliation is relevant under certain branches of the advance costs test, but argues that it has no role to play in the impecuniosity analysis. Canada says that the exceptional nature of an advance costs award means that merely having legitimate and reasonable infrastructure or social needs sets the bar too low. Beaver Lake did not satisfy the onus of proving that its proposed alternate uses for its financial resources meet a high threshold of necessity.

A.           Advance Costs

(1)         Guiding Judicial Discretion

[19]                          We begin with first principles. A court’s equitable jurisdiction over costs confers discretion to decide when, and by whom, costs are to be paid (Okanagan, at para. 35). This includes the power to award advance costs (also referred to as “interim costs”) prior to the final disposition of public interest litigation and in any event of the cause (Okanagan, at para. 1). Such awards are “meant to provide a basic level of assistance necessary for the case to proceed” (Little Sisters, at para. 43).

[20]                          In Okanagan, this Court held that advance costs could be awarded based on the strong public interest in obtaining a ruling on a legal issue of exceptional importance, that not only transcended the interests of the parties but also would, in the absence of public funding, have failed to proceed to a resolution, creating an injustice (para. 34; R. v. Caron, 2011 SCC 5, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 78, at para. 6). Access to justice is an important policy consideration underlying advance costs awards where a litigant seeks a determination of their constitutional rights and other issues of broad public significance, but lacks the financial resources to proceed. It has also been recognized by this Court as “fundamental to the rule of law” (Trial Lawyers Association of British Columbia v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 2014 SCC 59, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 31, at para. 39; see also B.C.G.E.U. v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 1988 CanLII 3 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 214, at p. 230). Further, costs awards can permit litigants of limited means, including vulnerable and historically disadvantaged groups, to have access to the courts in cases of public importance.

[21]                          But this Court has also emphasized that “Okanagan did not establish the access to justice rationale as the paramount consideration in awarding costs” and that “[c]oncerns about access to justice must be considered with and weighed against other important factors” (Little Sisters, at para. 35). Indeed, as this Court explained in Little Sisters, at para. 5, notwithstanding obstacles to access to justice such as underfunded and overwhelmed legal aid programs and growing instances of self‑representation, the Court in Okanagan “did not seek to create a parallel system of legal aid or a court‑managed comprehensive program”. Rather, Okanagan applies to those rare instances where a court would be “participating in an injustice — against the litigant personally and against the public generally” — by declining to exercise its discretion to order advance costs (Little Sisters, at para. 5). To award advance costs outside those instances would amount to “imprudent and inappropriate judicial overreach” (Little Sisters, at para. 44).

[22]                          The root of the concern underlying this narrow scope for an advance costs order is the separation of powers. In Ontario v. Criminal Lawyers’ Association of Ontario, 2013 SCC 43, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 3, this Court affirmed that “our constitutional framework prescribes different roles for the executive, legislative and judicial branches” (para. 27) and that it is “fundamental that no one of them overstep its bounds, that each show proper deference for the legitimate sphere of activity of the other” (para. 29, quoting New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia (Speaker of the House of Assembly), 1993 CanLII 153 (SCC), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 319, at p. 389). And so, in Caron, at para. 6, the Court observed that “[a]s a general rule, of course, it is for Parliament and the provincial legislatures to determine if and how public monies will be used to fund litigation against the Crown” (see also St‑Arnaud v. C.L., 2009 QCCA 97, at para. 29 (CanLII): “. . . the long‑lasting solution, if there is one, is to be found in distributive justice and falls within the purview of the legislator, rather than in corrective justice, which involves the intervention of the courts”). Allocating public resources among competing priorities is “a policy and economic question; it is a political decision” (Criminal Lawyers’ Association, at para. 43).

[23]                          Where, therefore, an applicant seeks to have its litigation funded by the public purse, courts must be mindful of the constraints of their institutional role. Those constraints necessarily confine a court’s discretion to grant such an award to narrow circumstances (Okanagan, at para. 41). It must be a “last resort” (Little Sisters, at paras. 36, 41, 71 and 73), reserved for the “rare and exceptional” case (Okanagan, at para. 1) and where, again, to refrain from awarding advance costs would be to participate in an injustice.

[24]                          In further keeping with these concerns, the test for advance costs is rigorous. Okanagan states three “absolute requirements” (Little Sisters, at para. 37) that must be satisfied: impecuniosity, a prima facie meritorious case, and issues of public importance. Further, while meeting these requirements is necessary, doing so does not automatically entitle an applicant to an advance costs award (Caron, at para. 39). Where the requirements are satisfied, a court — having considered all relevant individual circumstances of the case — retains residual discretion to decide whether to award advance costs, or to consider other ways of facilitating the hearing of the case (Little Sisters, at para. 37).

(2)         Reconciliation

[25]                          Since Okanagan, this Court has decided Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests), 2004 SCC 73, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 511, Taku River Tlingit First Nation v. British Columbia (Project Assessment Director), 2004 SCC 74, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 550, and Mikisew Cree First Nation v. Canada (Minister of Canadian Heritage), 2005 SCC 69, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 388. These judgments and others affirmed the Crown’s obligation to consult and accommodate Indigenous groups, and emphasized that the “fundamental objective of the modern law of aboriginal and treaty rights is the reconciliation of aboriginal peoples and non‑aboriginal peoples and their respective claims, interests and ambitions” (Mikisew Cree, at para. 1; see also Haida Nation, at para. 32; Taku River, at para. 42; Newfoundland and Labrador (Attorney General) v. Uashaunnuat (Innu of Uashat and of Mani‑Utenam), 2020 SCC 4, at para. 22). In R. v. Desautel, 2021 SCC 17, at para. 22, this Court reiterated that “the two purposes of s. 35(1) are to recognize the prior occupation of Canada by organized, autonomous societies and to reconcile their modern‑day existence with the Crown’s assertion of sovereignty” and that “[t]he same purposes are reflected in the principle of the honour of the Crown, under which the Crown’s historic assertion of sovereignty over Aboriginal societies gives rise to continuing obligations to their successors as part of an ongoing process of reconciliation.” As the parties and several interveners have invoked reconciliation here, it is worth explaining its significance in the advance costs test, with respect to a First Nation government applicant involved in s. 35 litigation.

[26]                          Where litigation raises novel issues concerning the interpretation of Aboriginal and treaty rights and the infringement of those rights, this may have significant weight in a court’s analysis of the public importance branch of the advance costs test and the exercise of its residual discretion. Other aspects of the Crown‑Aboriginal relationship may be relevant to a court’s exercise of its residual discretion since, at this stage, “the court must remain sensitive to any concerns that did not arise in its analysis of the test” (Little Sisters, at para. 72). For example, a court may be more inclined to exercise its discretion to award advance costs where the Crown has employed tactics to delay the resolution of the applicant’s claim (see Hagwilget Indian Band v. Canada (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development), 2008 FC 574, [2008] 3 C.N.L.R. 136, at paras. 20‑24).

[27]                          In assessing impecuniosity, a court must respectfully account for the broader context in which First Nations governments such as Beaver Lake make financial decisions. Promoting institutions and processes of Indigenous self‑governance fosters a positive, mutually respectful long‑term relationship between Indigenous and non‑Indigenous communities, thereby furthering the objective of reconciliation (First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun v. Yukon, 2017 SCC 58, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 576, at para. 10; Beckman v. Little Salmon/Carmacks First Nation, 2010 SCC 53, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 103, at paras. 9‑10). In the context of the impecuniosity analysis, this means that the pressing needs of a First Nation should be considered from the perspective of its government that sets its priorities and is best situated to identify its needs. We return below to what doing so specifically entails in this case.

(3)         The Terms of an Advance Costs Award

[28]                          Where a court decides that an award of advance costs is justified, the terms of the order must be carefully crafted. They must balance the interests of the parties, and should not impose an unfair burden (Okanagan, at para. 41). Accordingly, the order must provide for, or allow for the later provision of, oversight in the form of a “definite structure . . . imposed or approved by the court itself” that sets limits on the rates and hours of legal services and caps the award at an appropriate global amount (Little Sisters, at para. 42). The order should also build in judicial oversight to allow the court to “closely monitor the parties’ adherence to its dictates” (para. 43). In short, an advance costs order is not free rein. Because the public purse is burdened, there must be “scrutiny” of how a litigant spends the opposing party’s money (para. 42).

[29]                          Other terms of the order will, of course, be informed by a court’s findings in deciding impecuniosity. As outlined below, an applicant pleading impecuniosity must provide a litigation plan and sufficient evidence of its financial resources. While this will obviously be relevant to the quantum of the award, which should represent “a basic level of assistance necessary for the case to proceed” (Little Sisters, at para. 43), it will also assist in determining whether, for example, the terms of an advance cost order should include a requirement that the applicant commit to making some contribution to the litigation. It is, therefore, to that requirement of impecuniosity that we now turn.

B.            The Impecuniosity Requirement

(1)         Impecuniosity and First Nations Governments: The Threshold

[30]                          This Court has stated the requirement of impecuniosity in varying, but strict, terms. In Okanagan, it held that an applicant is impecunious if it “genuinely cannot afford to pay for the litigation, and no other realistic option exists for bringing the issues to trial — in short, the litigation would be unable to proceed if the order were not made” (para. 40). Likewise, in Little Sisters, this Court stated that the impecuniosity requirement “means that it must be proven to be impossible to proceed otherwise before advance costs will be ordered” (para. 71). And these general formulations have proven sufficient to decide the cases which have to date called upon the Court to apply the advance costs test. In Okanagan, the applicant bands faced extreme financial difficulty, as they ran deficits to finance day‑to‑day operations and were close to having outside management of their finances imposed upon them. It was impossible for them to fund the estimated litigation costs (paras. 4‑5). In Caron, the applicant had exhausted his limited personal funds, incurred debts, sought and received donations, and faced costly lawyer and expert fees (paras. 11‑13 and 21). Finally, in Little Sisters, this Court did not need to apply the impecuniosity requirement, as the other branches of the advance costs test were not satisfied (para. 67).

[31]                          What makes this a case of first impression is whether and how, in the context of a claim brought by a First Nation government, it can be said that it “genuinely cannot afford to pay” for, or that it is “impossible to proceed” with, public interest litigation, while having access to financial resources that it says must be otherwise allocated.

[32]                          The parties agree that, in such circumstances, the assessment of impecuniosity must look beyond the First Nation government’s financial resources in the abstract. A snapshot in time of its resources will be an important part of the analysis. But to assess whether a First Nation government genuinely cannot afford to pay for litigation, a court must also consider the broader context in which that government makes financial decisions, including its competing spending commitments, restrictions on the uses of its resources, and fiduciary and good governance obligations. A First Nation government may genuinely need to allocate some or all of its resources to priorities other than litigation.

[33]                          The parties and interveners in this appeal presented us with several proposals for modifying or elaborating on the meaning of the impecuniosity requirement to suit the circumstances before us. The intervener the Chiefs of Ontario, submits that where a First Nation government applicant is involved in s. 35 litigation, it should be presumed to be impecunious. Beaver Lake, in its factum, and several interveners argue that an applicant is impecunious where it is unable to finance the litigation because it has expended its resources on other “reasonable financial choices” (see, e.g., A.F., at paras. 4, 55, 58 and 61). Another intervener, the Advocates’ Society, proposes that the impecuniosity requirement should ask whether it would be “unduly onerous” for the applicant to be expected to fund the litigation (I.F., at paras. 3, 24-26 and 28).

[34]                          We would not modify the impecuniosity requirement in these ways.

[35]                          We recognize that access to justice is of particular importance in the context of s. 35 litigation, and further acknowledge that, in some cases, the dire financial circumstances of a First Nation government applicant may be the very result of the alleged interference with its constitutional rights at issue in the litigation. None of this, however, warrants a presumption that all First Nations government applicants are impecunious. First, this presumption is inappropriate, as the financial situation of First Nations governments varies throughout Canada. Secondly, the parameters for an award of advance costs and the impecuniosity branch of the test were developed in Okanagan, which was itself a s. 35 claim by a First Nation government applicant, and which held that impecuniosity “must be established on the evidence” (para. 36 (emphasis added)). Finally, a class‑based presumption of impecuniosity would risk turning the advance costs test into a parallel system of legal aid which, as noted above, would signify imprudent and inappropriate judicial overreach.

[36]                          That said, judicial notice may be taken of the systemic and background factors affecting Indigenous peoples in Canadian society. As this Court reiterated in R. v. Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433, at para. 60, in the context of criminal sentencing, “courts must take judicial notice of such matters as the history of colonialism, displacement, and residential schools and how that history continues to translate into lower educational attainment, lower incomes, higher unemployment, higher rates of substance abuse and suicide, and of course higher levels of incarceration for Aboriginal peoples”. In the context of the advance costs test, courts may also take notice of such matters insofar as they may be relevant to understanding a First Nation government’s financial situation and spending priorities.

[37]                          Nor can we accept thresholds based on a standard of “reasonableness” or on whether it would be “unduly onerous” for the applicant to fund the litigation. While assessing impecuniosity entails reviewing the evidence of a First Nation government’s expenditures on matters besides litigation, the ultimate determination cannot be reached by applying broad and open‑ended standards of reasonableness or undue burdens. These standards would dilute the requirement, repeatedly emphasized in Little Sisters, that advance costs awards “must be granted . . . in circumstances where the need for them is clearly established”, as a “last resort” (para. 36; see also paras. 41, 71, 73 and 78), and that “[a] court awarding advance costs must be guided by the condition of necessity” (para. 44 (emphasis added)).

[38]                          The concept of necessity is captured by this Court’s direction that advance costs are to be ordered as a “last resort”, where the First Nation government “genuinely cannot afford” the litigation and where it is “impossible to proceed”. It follows from this, in our view, that it is open to a court to decide that a First Nation government is impecunious when its prioritization of “pressing needs”, properly understood, has left it unable to fund public interest litigation. Doing so — as opposed, for example, to considering merely whether the First Nation government made a “reasonable” financial choice — is consistent with this Court’s strictures confining grants of advance costs, inasmuch as meeting a pressing need connotes necessity.

[39]                          An approach to impecuniosity that allows a First Nation government’s pressing needs to take priority over the litigation has been usefully applied in lower court decisions. For example, the concept of a First Nation government applicant’s “pressing needs” has been applied to determine if it is genuinely unable to pay for the litigation. In Keewatin v. Ontario (Minister of Natural Resources) (2006), 2006 CanLII 35625 (ON SC), 32 C.P.C. (6th) 258 (Ont. S.C.J.), Spies J. found that the applicant had access to $500,000 to $600,000 annually in trust fund income that could be used to finance the litigation, but concluded that it was nevertheless impecunious because it should use those funds to address “more pressing needs that would take priority over funding this litigation” (para. 83; see also paras. 80-82 and 96). Significantly, this approach also appears to reflect a broadly acceptable threshold for impecuniosity, as it was applied both by the case management judge and the Court of Appeal in this case, the latter identifying the central issue before it as “the extent to which the funding of this litigation can be ‘weighed against the community’s other pressing needs’” (para. 24, quoting the case management judge’s reasons, at para. 60).

[40]                          We are therefore content to affirm that an applicant genuinely cannot afford to pay for the litigation where, and only where, it cannot meet its pressing needs while also funding the litigation. And, as we explain further below, where the applicant is a First Nation government, pressing needs must be understood from the perspective of the First Nation government.

(2)         Assessing Pressing Needs

[41]                          Bearing in mind the extraordinary nature of the remedy, and the constraints of the judicial role in ordering the expenditure of public funds, assessing whether a First Nation government has sufficient resources to pay for the litigation after meeting its pressing needs requires that a court have a sufficient record to (1) identify the applicant’s pressing needs; (2) determine what resources are required to meet those needs; (3) assess the applicant’s resources (both assets and income); and (4) identify the estimated cost of funding the litigation. The level of evidential granularity required for a trier of fact to apply the legal test will vary, depending on the circumstances of the applicant. Detailed proof of an applicant’s pressing needs and the extent to which they are unfunded, and estimated litigation costs, may be required to ensure accountability over the expenditure of public funds. At the same time, it must not be prohibitively expensive to establish impecuniosity.

(a)           Identifying the Pressing Needs of a First Nation Government

[42]                          Where an applicant has access to financial resources that could potentially be used to pay for the litigation, it bears the onus of proving that it genuinely cannot afford to pay for the litigation because it must commit those resources to address other pressing needs. Identifying the pressing needs of a First Nation government will always be a fact‑specific determination; different communities may have different governance structures, funding arrangements and priorities, and so the evidence to establish pressing needs will vary from community to community.

[43]                          There can be no question that expenditures on basic necessities of life, including adequate housing, a safe water supply, and basic health and education services, rise to the level of addressing a pressing need. Spending to improve standards of living, for example, to provide enhanced health and education services or to promote cultural survival, may also qualify.

[44]                          Further, and as we have already observed (at para. 25), the goal of reconciling Aboriginal interests with the broader interests of society will inform how a court identifies the pressing needs of a First Nation government. Reconciliation requires a court to consider the pressing needs of a First Nation government applicant from its perspective as a government that sets its own priorities and is best situated to identify its needs. Accordingly, a court identifying the pressing needs of a First Nation government may have regard to what that government has prioritized in the past as indicated, for example, by records of Crown consultation, of negotiations with the Crown for funding, by band council resolutions requesting access to capital and revenue moneys, and in records of internal departmental or other meetings dealing with its budgeting and priorities. Certain prioritized expenditures, such as allocating funds to construct a skating rink or to promote the First Nation’s culture, may not appear to a court to address a pressing need on their face. And yet, a community may adduce evidence of how it has prioritized this project because it promotes its Indigenous identity or, for example, an urgent problem of youth in crisis has led it to promote physical health, outdoor activities or traditional cultural practices (Keewatin, at para. 59).

(b)         The Extent of Unfunded Pressing Needs

[45]                          Identification by a court of needs as truly pressing will not establish impecuniosity. An applicant should also adduce evidence of the costs of meeting those needs and the extent to which it cannot cover those costs. The amount of detail required will depend on the circumstances, including the nature of the unmet needs and any difficulties in estimating the cost of those needs.

[46]                          Additionally, where the applicant has access to resources that could potentially pay for the litigation but which it says must be devoted to its pressing needs, it must demonstrate that those resources are in fact being devoted to addressing those pressing needs. We concur with the Court of Appeal of Alberta’s statement in the present case that “[f]unds that are available to meet infrastructure and services deficits must be used for that purpose before a claim can be made for advance [costs], based on an argument that available funds are needed for those other priorities” (para. 31). In this regard, evidence of an applicant’s plan for the use of its financial resources would be relevant.

(c)           Assessing the Applicant’s Financial Resources

[47]                          It follows from our jurisprudence that in some cases, a finding of impecuniosity can be made even where the applicant does not adduce detailed evidence, either because the applicant does not have any available financial resources, as in Okanagan, or because it is obvious that its financial resources would be outstripped by the nature and extent of its pressing needs as compared with its estimated litigation costs.

[48]                          Lower court cases illustrate how a finding of impecuniosity can find support in the evidence adduced by a First Nation government applicant. In Missanabic Cree First Nation v. Ontario, 2011 ONSC 5196, 38 C.P.C. (7th) 385, the First Nation government satisfied the impecuniosity requirement where it adduced years of financial statements disclosing that its liabilities exceeded its assets, that it had significant long‑term debt, and that it did not have any unrestricted revenue sources that could be used towards the litigation (paras. 41‑47). In Hagwilget Indian Band, litigation between the applicant band and Canada had persisted for 20 years, leaving the band “with virtually no resources” (para. 12). It was manifest to the court that the band could not pursue the litigation without advance costs, since its funding was closely controlled by the government, it had been unsuccessful in obtaining other sources of funding, it owed counsel over $140,000, ran deficits, had no available credit, and had to close its band council offices for over three weeks due to lack of funding (paras. 12‑14). In Keewatin, the record established that securing funding from individual members was impractical, virtually all funding came from the federal and provincial governments and was earmarked for specific priorities, the band ran deficits in successive years, the majority of its members were unemployed, lacked adequate housing and an adequate water supply, and other sources of funding had been explored but were inadequate to fund the litigation. On this basis, the band was found to be impecunious (para. 108).

[49]                          Where a First Nation government applicant has extensive assets and ongoing revenue, however, more detailed evidence of its financial resources is required to demonstrate impecuniosity. This may include an account of its assets, liabilities, income and expenses, information about restrictions on revenue, number of employees and salaries, and evidence of its ability and efforts to obtain funding from alternative sources. And where a responding party challenges an applicant’s contention that certain financial resources are unavailable because they have been or are being spent to address pressing needs, the applicant may be required to justify the challenged expenditures.

[50]                          In all cases, because advance costs are a measure of last resort, an applicant must demonstrate that it made sufficient efforts to obtain funding from alternate sources. Depending on the circumstances, if an applicant requires ministerial permission to access certain funds, it should demonstrate that it sought this permission (and been declined), or justify its choice to refrain from doing so (Little Sisters, at para. 68). Similarly, a court should generally consider whether the applicant attempted to obtain private funding through fundraising campaigns or tried to obtain a loan (paras. 40 and 70). What is required in each case will vary depending on the evidence of what funding is realistically available. For example, in Caron, this Court deferred to the application judge’s finding that it was not “realistically possible” for the applicant to launch a formal fundraising campaign as the litigation unfolded, given the trial schedule and its demands (para. 41, quoting R. v. Caron, 2007 ABQB 632, 424 A.R. 377, at para. 30).

(d)         Comparing Estimated Litigation Costs and the Applicant’s Surplus Resources

[51]                          Little Sisters instructs that “cost estimates [for the litigation] form an integral part of the evidence; the court should subject them to scrutiny, and then use them to consider whether the litigant is impecunious” (para. 69). Consistent with this direction, an applicant must submit an up‑to‑date litigation plan so that a court can know, at least approximately, the cost of pursuing the litigation.

[52]                          Ultimately, after assessing the financial resources available to a First Nation government applicant, the extent to which it must commit those resources to pressing needs in priority to the litigation and the estimated cost of the litigation, a determination can be made regarding whether the applicant has surplus resources with which it may finance the litigation in whole or in part.

C.            Application of the Framework to This Appeal

[53]                          Disturbing the case management judge’s discretionary decision to award advance costs cannot be undertaken lightly (Little Sisters, at para. 49). At the same time, in making an exceptional award of advance costs, “trial judges must . . . be careful to stay within recognized boundaries” (para. 49). Even discretionary decisions are not completely insulated from review, and appellate intervention is warranted where a trial judge has misdirected himself or herself as to the applicable law, including the identification of the requisite legal criteria, their definition and their application (Okanagan, at paras. 36 and 43).

[54]                          Here, the case management judge, acting without the benefit of these reasons, made general observations about Beaver Lake’s financial resources and pressing needs to find that it was an impoverished community. On the record before her, that finding is unassailable. But with great respect, it is, without more, insufficient. She did not make the particular findings necessary in these circumstances to decide impecuniosity or to determine the amount of advance costs required to enable Beaver Lake to pursue the litigation. Indeed, the record before her was itself insufficient to support such findings. For these reasons, and because Beaver Lake’s financial circumstances have changed since its initial application (indeed, the fresh evidence before the Court of Appeal demonstrates that those circumstances are dynamic), this matter must be remitted for a new hearing so that impecuniosity can be decided in accordance with these reasons.

(1)         Beaver Lake’s Pressing Needs

[55]                          As we have already recounted, the case management judge found that Beaver Lake has “substantial deficits in housing and infrastructure and . . . high levels of unemployment and social assistance” (para. 30). These findings, too, were fully available on the record before her. Beaver Lake adduced and was cross‑examined on extensive affidavit evidence regarding the community’s living conditions that spoke of food insecurity and lack of access to lands, social assistance, unemployment, inadequate housing, inadequate infrastructure, insufficient resources for health and education programs, poor water quality and access, health needs, and overall poverty. Further, the record showed that ameliorating these conditions had been identified as significant priorities by the band.

[56]                          In light of this evidence, we agree that the case management judge appropriately identified Beaver Lake’s pressing needs. Such matters fall within the basic necessities of life which, as such, clearly rise to the level of pressing needs within the circumstances of this applicant. In particular, allocating resources to improve deficits in housing, infrastructure, and basic social programming would, from the perspective of this First Nation government, constitute the addressing of pressing needs. We therefore disagree with the Court of Appeal inasmuch as it suggests that expenditures thereon represent “spending on desirable improvements” rather than spending on pressing needs (para. 28).

(2)         The Extent of Beaver Lake’s Unfunded Pressing Needs

[57]                          The case management judge did not make findings regarding the estimated costs of Beaver Lake’s pressing needs, or the extent to which those costs are not covered by the financial resources available to Beaver Lake. Nor were the necessary specific findings made to show how those resources were being applied to meet those needs.

[58]                          Indeed, the case management judge could not have made those findings on the record before her. A constant refrain in the evidence and submissions was that Beaver Lake could not meet its pressing needs because it lacked sufficient funds. Yet, there was no specific account of how much it would cost to address Beaver Lake’s pressing needs, or why no other resources were available to meet those needs. The case management judge should have been told, for example, why federal funding allocated to Beaver Lake’s pressing needs falls short of adequately addressing them.

[59]                          The evidence concerning Beaver Lake’s financial resources did not fully answer whether those resources were required to address its pressing needs, and whether any funds would remain that could potentially pay for the litigation. For example, evidence of financial statements, while helpful, were insufficient since they do not identify Beaver Lake’s current or future needs, or the extent to which funding has or has not been allocated to meeting them (A.R., vol. XII, at pp. 180-83).

[60]                          Beaver Lake’s band administrator, John Geoffrey Rankin, deposed that, in discharging his responsibility to develop business strategies that align with the community’s short‑ and long‑term objectives, he meets weekly with band departmental managers to review progress on priorities, develop and assess departmental budgets, and assist with additional funding requests (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 12‑13). However, the content and outcome of those meetings were not before case management judge. Placing this evidence before the court could help it understand not only the community’s pressing needs (although, as we have discussed, they were adequately demonstrated in this case), but also how existing and future resources are to be allocated to meet those needs, whether those resources will be sufficient, and whether there are pressing needs that will nonetheless go unmet.

[61]                          It follows that the court will require evidence that quantifies the financial resources required to meet the First Nation government’s pressing needs. Here, for example, it was unclear just how much it would cost to provide adequate housing. Mr. Rankin’s affidavit indicated that 50 members are on the waitlist for housing, 20 houses are in need of immediate major repairs, and 8 houses need to be replaced due to health and safety concerns (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 24‑25). But it would be difficult for a court to know what resources must be allocated to these needs without estimates of how much that work would cost, coupled with an explanation of why other sources of funds could not cover these costs. While some of these costs may be unpredictable, more information should be provided where possible; if further information is not available at the time of application, Beaver Lake should explain why it is not. Similarly, Beaver Lake’s evidence was that repairs were needed for its sewer system and treatment lagoon, but whether its resources, present or future, could be allocated to that expense was not explained. We were told at the hearing that Canada has agreed “to provide the funds and that [it] is costing up to $8 million” (transcript, at p. 26; see also p. 90). However, a court would need to know whether the funding is conditional, whether those conditions are practically achievable, whether this government funding is sufficient and, if not, whether Beaver Lake proposes to allocate resources to address this need.

(3)         Beaver Lake’s Financial Resources

[62]                          The case management judge considered Beaver Lake’s resources to arrive at the conclusion that it had more than $3 million in unrestricted assets potentially available for the litigation. She was entitled to make this finding based on the evidence provided by Beaver Lake, which consisted of financial statements, affidavits from band council and community members, government reports and correspondence, and expert evidence concerning Beaver Lake’s assets and sources of revenue.

[63]                          Additional evidence regarding Beaver Lake’s assets and income, including any restrictions on those resources, and its liabilities and expenses could help the court more accurately determine what resources Beaver Lake could access. It would also be helpful if Beaver Lake were to provide a more detailed account of its efforts to obtain funding from alternate sources. The following examples illustrate how the analysis of Beaver Lake’s financial resources would have benefitted from further elaboration.

[64]                          First, Beaver Lake created the Heritage Trust as a vehicle to manage income received from projects carried out on its traditional lands, which Beaver Lake allocates towards community development programs and services according to the terms of the Trust Agreement. Under the Trust’s terms, Beaver Lake can draw up to 10 percent once every four years for these community activities, some of which at least, on their face, may correspond to some of Beaver Lake’s pressing needs. Beaver Lake explained that the purpose of the restriction on withdrawals from the Trust is to enable it to build capital to start to address its deep deficits; however, more clarity regarding the purposes of the funding and how it is allocated would be helpful. It is unclear on the current record why the Trust funds are insufficient to meet at least some of Beaver Lake’s pressing needs.

[65]                          Secondly, Beaver Lake has access, under certain conditions, to the Indian Oil and Gas Canada Trust, which consists of funds derived from ongoing revenue from oil and gas extraction on the Beaver Lake Reserve. There are no restrictions on the purposes for which the funds could be used, although accessing funds from the Trust requires ministerial approval. While we note Beaver Lake’s explanation that the Trust is an “emergency fund” used for immediate needs such as urgent infrastructure repairs (A.F., at para. 36), knowing more about the binding quality of those restrictions or of Beaver Lake’s past use of these funds for emergency purposes, and whether Beaver Lake sought approval to finance the litigation (or if not, why not) would assist the court.

[66]                          Finally, while Beaver Lake received approval to become a borrowing member of the First Nations Finance Authority (R.R., Alberta, vol. I, at pp. 141 and 143; case management judge’s reasons, at para. 58), the evidence does not show that it has sought to obtain a loan to pursue litigation. It would assist the court to know why this is so or, alternatively, if indeed it has applied for a loan, the Authority’s response.

[67]                          In short, the case management judge required a more particularized and comprehensive record in order to consider whether Beaver Lake had made sufficient efforts to obtain funding from alternate sources, and whether other sources of funds are available to be used for the litigation. This is no small consideration: a court must be satisfied that an applicant has explained with sufficient detail whether its financial resources can be used to finance the litigation, and if not, why not.

(4)         Comparing Beaver Lake’s Estimated Litigation Costs and Surplus Resources

[68]                          Consistent with this Court’s direction in Little Sisters, the case management judge reviewed Beaver Lake’s litigation plan and determined the quantum of funds required to pursue the litigation. She accepted Beaver Lake’s estimate of $5 million for the litigation. As part of this exercise, the case management judge was required to determine whether Beaver Lake had any surplus resources to finance the litigation in whole or in part and to assess the funds necessary to advance the litigation. As the matter is being remitted for a new hearing, and given the amount of time that has elapsed from the initial application, and further given that Beaver Lake’s litigation plan was dated 2014 and marked “without prejudice”, Beaver Lake should submit a current litigation plan to assist the court with this determination. This information, combined with a more detailed record that addresses the questions raised above, would help the court understand the extent to which Beaver Lake must commit its present and future resources to pressing needs instead of the litigation, quantify the estimated cost of the litigation, and determine whether Beaver Lake has any surplus resources to finance the litigation in whole or in part.

(5)         The Fresh Evidence

[69]                          In our view, the evidence of the amount received by Beaver Lake from the resolved specific claim ($2.97 million) is not conclusive; indeed, it raises more questions. Nor does it speak to Beaver Lake’s current financial resources or pressing needs. Chief Anderson deposes that the settlement funds will be applied to various priorities, including another lawsuit, infrastructure and housing, upgrading Beaver Lake’s water treatment system, gas lines installation, electricity and sewage, and COVID‑19 support payments (A.R., vol. VIII, at pp. 85‑86). However, it is unclear whether the funding for “sewage” overlaps with the sewage lagoon and, if so, whether Canada has already covered the cost of meeting that pressing need. Further yet, the amounts to be paid in COVID‑19 supports is unspecified, as are the sources from which those payments are to be made. Finally, while Chief Anderson identifies those needs, and while those needs may well qualify as pressing, it is unclear how much those needs cost and what other sources may be applied to cover them.

[70]                          In any event, the fact of the specific claim settlement should, in our view, have led the Court of Appeal to return the matter to the Court of Queen’s Bench for consideration. Indeed, the case management judge’s order contemplated precisely that procedure, directing that “if Beaver Lake receives compensation from its outstanding claims or otherwise receives a windfall, then this order shall be revisited” (para. 67).

(6)         The Terms of the Advance Costs Order

[71]                          In the absence of a sufficient record on which the case management judge could make findings regarding the cost of meeting Beaver Lake’s pressing needs, the resources available to fund those needs, and any resources left over for the litigation, it is unclear how the case management judge arrived at the amount of $300,000 to be paid by each party. Nor is it clear whether this amount was to be paid proportionally or in priority order as expenses were incurred (i.e., Beaver Lake, then Alberta, then Canada). Further, the terms of the order did not provide the “definite structure” which this Court in Little Sisters stated was necessary to provide oversight and direction to the award’s administration, or a global cap or limits on legal fees (paras. 42‑43).

IV.         Disposition

[72]                          We would allow the appeal and remit the application to the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta. We are mindful of the time and resources expended by the parties in the nearly 14 years since this litigation began. This is, however, a case of first impression. Moreover, the matter now requires reconsideration, both in accordance with these reasons and in light of the passage of time since the original hearing.

[73]                          We would also award solicitor‑client costs to Beaver Lake in this Court and in the courts below. Solicitor‑client costs, being a form of special costs (S.A. v. Metro Vancouver Housing Corp., 2019 SCC 4, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 99, at paras. 67‑71), are awardable where the case involves matters of public interest that are truly exceptional, where the applicant shows it has no personal, proprietary or pecuniary interest in the litigation that would justify the proceedings on economic grounds, and where it would not have been possible for the litigation to be pursued with private funding (Carter v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 5, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 331, at para. 140). The case management judge in the present case found that Beaver Lake’s underlying litigation satisfied the public importance branch of the advance costs test. Additionally, in our view, the question of advance costs for a First Nation government claimant possessing resources of its own represents a truly exceptional matter of public interest. As we have explained, this is not only a case of first impression, but one that goes to the heart of the separation of powers.

[74]                          While Beaver Lake has some personal, proprietary or pecuniary interest in the underlying litigation, it did not initiate proceedings on primarily private or economic grounds. The case management judge found, at para. 26, that a contingency fee arrangement was not practical in this case, in part, because Beaver Lake’s “primary claim . . . is for a declaration and the claim for monetary relief is secondary”. Finally, in the specific context of an interlocutory application for advance costs, while we cannot say that Beaver Lake has shown that it would not have been possible to pursue this matter with private funding, the entire point of this appeal was to explain what it must show in order to meet that threshold. These are unique circumstances.

 

                    Appeal allowed.

2022 SCC 7

The appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador, Number 201901H0005, 2021 NLCA 39, dated June 25, 2021, was heard on March 18, 2022, and the Court on that day delivered the following judgment orally:

Karakatsanis J. — This appeal as of right comes to us based on the dissent of Hoegg J.A. in the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador. For the following reasons, we are all agreed to allow the appeal.

The respondent, Trent White, was charged with several offences following an incident on a fishing vessel off the coast of Labrador in 2017. The charges included aggravated assault, an offence for which Mr. White had a right to choose between a trial in the Provincial Court, a trial in the Supreme Court before a judge alone, and a trial in the Supreme Court before a judge and jury (Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 536(2)). His trial counsel told the court that Mr. White was electing for a trial in Provincial Court. He was later convicted of assault, aggravated assault, and mischief.

Mr. White appealed, seeking a new trial on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. According to him, his trial counsel had failed to advise him of his choices and had elected for a Provincial Court trial on his behalf without discussion or instructions. Mr. White did not indicate, however, that he would have considered a different election, or that he would elect differently on a retrial.

A majority of the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador accepted Mr. White’s uncontradicted evidence, allowed his appeal, and ordered a new trial. Reasoning that an election is one of the important rights of an accused, the majority concluded that his counsel’s failure to advise his client, or to seek his instructions on the choice, undermined trial fairness and resulted in a miscarriage of justice, satisfying the test for ineffective assistance of counsel (para. 23 (CanLII)). Citing the Ontario Court of Appeal’s decision in R. v. Stark, 2017 ONCA 148, 347 C.C.C. (3d) 73, it explained that Mr. White was “not required to establish further prejudice” (para. 12).

We agree that the right to elect the mode of trial is an important right that should be exercised by the accused. But we do not agree that Mr. White has shown that the circumstances of this case resulted in a miscarriage of justice.

Rather, we agree with Hoegg J.A., in dissent, that ineffective assistance of counsel was not made out. Ineffective assistance has a “performance component” and a “prejudice component”: for such a claim to succeed, the appellant must establish that (1) counsel’s acts or omissions constituted incompetence; and (2) that a miscarriage of justice resulted (R. v. G.D.B., 2000 SCC 22, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520, at para. 26). Here, Mr. White failed to state that he would have chosen differently had counsel informed him of his right to elect his mode of trial. Even accepting Mr. White’s evidence that there was no discussion or consultation regarding his right of election, it did not rise to a miscarriage of justice in this case.

In G.D.B., the Court explained that counsel’s failure to discuss and obtain instructions on fundamental decisions relating to an accused’s defence “may in some circumstances raise questions of procedural fairness and the reliability of the result leading to a miscarriage of justice” (para. 34). Stark itself recognizes this at para. 32. However, the Court has never provided that the loss of those decisions alone warrants a new trial on ineffective assistance grounds. To the extent that Stark suggests otherwise, it is incorrect. The accused must, in most cases, demonstrate more than the loss of choice.

Although it did not address ineffective assistance of counsel, the Court in R. v. Wong, 2018 SCC 25, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 696, explained that to withdraw a guilty plea on the basis that the accused was unaware of legally relevant consequences, an accused must show subjective prejudice. Subjective prejudice demanded that an accused demonstrate there was a “reasonable possibility” they would have acted differently (para. 6). The Court was unanimous that a mere failure to exercise an informed choice was insufficient. In our view, these principles also apply to an accused’s election of the mode of trial.

Further, Mr. White’s request for a new trial cannot succeed on the basis of an appearance of unfairness. The standard for establishing a miscarriage of justice on this basis is high; the defect must be “so serious that it shakes public confidence in the administration of justice” (R. v. Davey, 2012 SCC 75, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 828, at para. 51, quoting R. v. Wolkins, 2005 NSCA 2, 229 N.S.R. (2d) 222, at para. 89). While the loss of his right to elect was serious, the facts of this appeal do not rise to that standard. Indeed, if Mr. White’s convictions were set aside, and he proceeded with the same election on retrial, that could undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.

Finally, even if Mr. White’s loss of his election amounted to a procedural error under s. 536(2) of the Criminal Code, the Provincial Court retained jurisdiction to hear the matter, since the court had jurisdiction “over the class of offence” under s. 686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code (R. v. Esseghaier, 2021 SCC 9, at para. 48, fn. 2).

For these reasons, we would allow the appeal and remand the matter to the Court of Appeal to address Mr. White’s remaining grounds of appeal, which were not addressed below.


2022 SCC 8

The appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador, Number 201901H0095, 2021 NLCA 47, dated August 18, 2021, was heard on March 21, 2022, and the Court on that day delivered the following judgment orally:

The Chief Justice — A majority of this Court, made of Justice Moldaver, Justice Karakatsanis, Justice Brown, Justice Kasirer and Justice Jamal, would dismiss the appeal, essentially for the reasons of the majority of the Court of Appeal, whereas myself, Justice Côté, Justice Rowe and Justice Martin would allow the appeal, essentially for the reasons of Justice Goodridge.

The appeal is therefore dismissed.

                  Moldaver J. —

I.               Introduction

[1]                             Managing a criminal trial is a demanding task. This trial was no exception. It devolved into a nine-day, highly contested jury trial over a seemingly straightforward issue: whether Mr. Samaniego and/or his co-accused, Mr. Serrano, had possession of a handgun. The experienced trial judge had her hands full keeping the proceedings on track. Without her patience and her overriding concern that all parties be treated fairly, it almost certainly would have resulted in a mistrial. Cut-throat defences led to bickering among the parties; time estimates were honoured more in the breach than in the observance; and the jury was repeatedly required to leave the courtroom while the trial judge dealt with case management and evidentiary issues, many of which were attributable to the manner in which the main Crown witness was cross-examined by Mr. Samaniego’s trial counsel (“trial counsel”).

[2]                              This appeal centres on that cross-examination. It was neither a model of brevity nor clarity. On the contrary, it went on at great length and drew numerous objections from both Crown counsel and Mr. Serrano’s counsel for being repetitive, unfocused, and misleading. To make matters worse, when the trial judge tried to clarify the purpose and relevance of trial counsel’s questions, she was often met with unclear and unhelpful responses.

[3]                             In the course of trial counsel’s cross-examination, over her objection, the trial judge made a number of rulings curtailing lines of questioning. Four of these rulings form the basis of this appeal. The jury eventually convicted Mr. Samaniego of possession of a loaded restricted firearm, contrary to s. 95(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. On his appeal from conviction to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, a majority of the court found no error in the four rulings and dismissed Mr. Samaniego’s appeal (2020 ONCA 439, 151 O.R. (3d) 449). The crux of the disagreement between the majority and the minority centred on whether the impugned rulings were discretionary, falling within the trial judge’s exercise of her trial management power, or whether they constituted erroneous evidentiary rulings that warranted a new trial. The majority found that the rulings were an exercise of the judge’s trial management power and revealed no error. The dissenting judge found evidentiary errors in all four rulings and would have ordered a new trial. He stressed that the trial management power could not override proper evidentiary considerations and justify improper evidentiary rulings. Mr. Samaniego now appeals to this Court as of right.

[4]                             For reasons that follow, I would dismiss Mr. Samaniego’s appeal. Under their trial management power, trial judges are permitted to control their courtroom and streamline the functioning of the trial. Exercises of trial management will generally not overlap with evidentiary rulings, but sometimes they do. This does not mean that erroneous evidentiary rulings can be justified under the guise of trial management. They cannot.

[5]                             In this case, some of the impugned rulings involved trial management decisions, while others involved a mixture of evidentiary determinations and trial management decisions. As I will explain, I am satisfied that three of the impugned rulings were free from error. The fourth ruling was erroneous in part; in my view, however, it occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

II.            Background

A.           The Offence

[6]                             As part of an agreed statement of facts, the parties acknowledge that on August 17, 2015, Mr. Samaniego and his co-accused, Mr. Serrano, went to a Toronto nightclub called Las Brisas. The security guard greeted Mr. Serrano at the door and allowed him into the club; the two were good friends. The guard denied Mr. Samaniego entrance because Mr. Samaniego had threatened him at the club on a prior occasion. The parties further agree that, later in the evening, the guard’s friend called the police about a gun at the club. When the police arrived, they saw Mr. Serrano and Mr. Samaniego walking away and observed Mr. Serrano discard a gun. They arrested both men for possession of a loaded restricted firearm.

[7]                             The parties’ stories differ on what happened at the club before the police arrived. Surveillance video at the club showed the two accused and the security guard, but not the gun. Identity was admitted. The main issue at trial was whether one or both of the accused had possession of the gun.

[8]                             The Crown’s position was that both men had the gun in their possession at some point that evening. In support of its position, Crown counsel relied heavily on the security guard’s testimony. The guard testified that Mr. Samaniego became angry at him when he allowed Mr. Serrano into the club, but barred Mr. Samaniego from entering. Mr. Samaniego threatened him with a finger/thumb motion that looked like a gun and showed him a gun in his waistband. Mr. Serrano came out of the club and defused the situation by taking the gun away from Mr. Samaniego. Mr. Serrano went back into the club, came out, dropped the gun in front of the guard and picked it back up. The guard then asked a friend, who was close by, to call the police. Mr. Serrano and Mr. Samaniego left the club and were arrested a short time later.

[9]                             The two accused ran cut-throat defences. Mr. Serrano maintained that he had no knowledge of Mr. Samaniego bringing a gun to the club. It was never his intention to possess it; he only took it to protect the security guard from Mr. Samaniego. Moreover, he argued that there was no evidence that he knew the gun was real, restricted, or loaded.

[10]                        Mr. Samaniego’s defence was that Mr. Serrano had sole possession of the gun; he never touched it. In support of his position, he sought to impeach the security guard’s credibility, arguing that the guard implicated him to protect Mr. Serrano, the guard’s “good friend”. He did so by covering up for Mr. Serrano, withholding information from the police and falsely portraying Mr. Serrano in the best possible light.

B.            Mr. Samaniego’s Cross-Examination of the Security Guard

[11]                        Trial counsel’s cross-examination of the security guard lasted approximately a day and a half, spanning over 150 pages of transcript. Time estimates were repeatedly exceeded. On the first day of her cross-examination, she questioned the guard for approximately 2 hours and advised that she would need 45 minutes the next morning. An hour into her cross-examination the following morning, the judge reminded her of her timeline. Counsel advised that she needed another 30 minutes at most. That estimate proved to be grossly inaccurate; the remainder of her cross‑examination took up the entire day.

[12]                        As the record reveals, the cross-examination was often repetitive, wandering, and misleading. Some questions were difficult to understand, particularly for the security guard who required the assistance of an interpreter. The purpose and relevance of many lines of inquiry were difficult to discern. The judge had to excuse the jury five times to discuss issues arising from the cross-examination. Many of these discussions were lengthy and covered ground that had already been dealt with.

[13]                        The potential for prejudice caused by both accused running cut-throat defences added another dimension of difficulty for the judge. Some of trial counsel’s lines of inquiry were highly prejudicial to Mr. Serrano. It was essential that the judge closely monitor the risk this prejudice posed, bearing in mind her obligation to ensure that both accused received a fair trial.

[14]                        In sum, the trial judge had her hands full trying to ensure trial fairness, minimize jury disruption, and rein in a cross-examination that was lengthy, disjointed, and confusing. That she was able to keep the trial on the rails in the circumstances is a credit to her patience and the care she exhibited throughout to protect the interests of the parties, the witnesses, and the members of the jury.

III.         Issues

[15]                        There are four issues:

A.                     Jurisdiction: Does Mr. Samaniego’s appeal to this Court raise a question of law?

B.                     What is the scope of the trial management power?

C.                     Did the trial judge err by curtailing cross-examination in any of the four rulings?

D.                     If so, can the curative proviso be applied to sustain Mr. Samaniego’s conviction?

IV.         Analysis

A.           Jurisdiction: Mr. Samaniego Appeals on a Question of Law

[16]                        Mr. Samaniego appeals to this Court under s. 691(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. That provision allows an accused to appeal as of right on a question of law from a dissenting judgment at the court of appeal.

[17]                        The Crown submits that Mr. Samaniego’s appeal is barred because the disagreement at the Court of Appeal does not raise a question of law; rather, the disagreement between the majority and dissenting judge is largely factual, hinging on differing interpretations of trial counsel’s purpose for engaging in certain areas of cross-examination. This does not, in the Crown’s view, raise a question of law. A judge’s choice to intervene in cross-examination is a question of mixed fact and law (Fanjoy v. The Queen, 1985 CanLII 53 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 233, at p. 238). Mr. Samaniego characterizes the disagreement at the Court of Appeal differently. He maintains that it raises a question of law regarding the rules of evidence and their application.

[18]                        I agree with Mr. Samaniego’s characterization of the disagreement. While the subject of the appeal was the trial judge’s intervention in cross-examination, this was not the crux of the Court of Appeal’s disagreement. The court disagreed on the characterization of the judge’s interventions and the evidentiary principles that govern them. That raises a question of law (R. v. Biniaris, 2000 SCC 15, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, at para. 23).

B.            Scope of the Trial Management Power

[19]                        Before examining the impugned rulings, it is necessary to discuss the content and scope of the trial management power.

[20]                        The trial management power allows trial judges to control the process of their court and ensure that trials proceed in an effective and orderly fashion. While this Court has not provided explicit guidance on the nature and scope of the power, it has implicitly endorsed the concept (R. v. Anderson, 2014 SCC 41, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 167, at para. 58; Ontario v. Criminal Lawyers’ Association of Ontario, 2013 SCC 43, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 26).

[21]                        The power has three interrelated purposes: ensuring that trials proceed fairly, effectively, and efficiently (R. v. John, 2017 ONCA 622, 350 C.C.C. (3d) 397, at para. 47; R. v. Polanco, 2018 ONCA 444, at para. 22 (CanLII)).

[22]                        Judges may intervene to manage the conduct of trials in many ways, including restricting cross-examination that is unduly repetitive, rambling, argumentative, misleading, or irrelevant (R. v. Ivall, 2018 ONCA 1026, 370 C.C.C. (3d) 179, at paras. 167-68; R. v. Snow (2004), 2004 CanLII 34547 (ON CA), 73 O.R. (3d) 40 (C.A.), at para. 25). The trial management power is an essential and versatile tool; it must, however, be exercised carefully (R. v. Felderhof (2003), 2003 CanLII 37346 (ON CA), 68 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.), at para. 38). Parties should generally be allowed to present their cases as they see fit (Polanco, at para. 29).

[23]                        Managing the conduct of trials to ensure timely justice is particularly important, considering this Court’s decision in R. v. Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631, at para. 139. Excessive trial delay can be mitigated by proper trial management.

[24]                        Ensuring efficiency does not mean sacrificing the rules of evidence. Mr. Samaniego submits that trial management decisions and evidentiary rulings must always remain separate to ensure that erroneous evidentiary rulings are not glossed over under the guise of trial management on appellate review. While I disagree that trial management and evidentiary rulings must always remain separate, I agree that trial management does not provide a safe haven for erroneous evidentiary rulings.

[25]                        Trial management decisions and the rules of evidence must generally remain separate issues on appellate review. The standard of review for evidentiary errors is correctness, while deference is owed to trial management decisions. Extricable evidentiary errors are held to a more stringent standard of review than trial management decisions. The trial management power is not a license to exclude otherwise relevant and material evidence in the name of efficiency.

[26]                        Sometimes trial management decisions will overlap with the rules of evidence. For example, where counsel tries to revive a line of inquiry that the trial judge has previously barred in an evidentiary ruling, the rules of evidence and trial management overlap. Drawing on the previous evidentiary ruling — that the line of questioning is barred by an evidentiary rule — the judge exercises their trial management power to curtail irrelevant and repetitive questioning. As this example illustrates, it is important on appellate review that trial management decisions are examined in the context of the trial as a whole, rather than as isolated incidents. Trial management decisions, as the one in this example, engage the judge’s discretion. Absent error in principle or unreasonable exercise, these discretionary decisions deserve deference (R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at para. 44).

C.            The Impugned Trial Rulings

[27]                        Mr. Samaniego submits that the trial judge improperly curtailed four lines of questioning during his counsel’s cross-examination of the security guard: (1) whether there was a cocaine transaction between Mr. Serrano and the security guard; (2) whether the security guard was “scared” at any time during the incident; (3) whether the security guard “refused” to identify the two accused; and (4) who dropped the gun and who picked it up. He does not raise ineffective assistance of counsel. The Crown submits that the judge properly curtailed all four lines of questioning as an exercise of her trial management power.

[28]                        As I will explain, the trial judge did not err in curtailing the first three impugned lines of questioning. This Court only divides on the fourth ruling set out in the preceding paragraph, namely who dropped the gun and who picked it up. On that ruling, while I am satisfied that the curtailment of questioning was erroneous in part, I conclude that the error was harmless and occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.

(1)         Whether There Was a Cocaine Transaction Between Mr. Serrano and the Security Guard

(a)           Background and Ruling

[29]                        Trial counsel attempted to pursue a line of questioning intended to suggest that Mr. Serrano went to the club that night either to sell cocaine to, or buy cocaine from, the security guard. She asked the guard if he took cocaine that day. He said no. She asked if he saw Mr. Serrano taking cocaine. He said no. Trial counsel then suggested to the guard that Mr. Serrano had cocaine on him when he was arrested: “Surprise[d] to learn that . . . he had some cocaine on him when he was arrested?” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 85). The guard replied that he did not understand.

[30]                        Both the Crown and Mr. Serrano’s counsel objected to this line of questioning. The judge excused the jury and conducted a voir dire. The Crown submitted that the questioning was improper. While acknowledging that Mr. Serrano was initially charged with possession of cocaine, the Crown did not seek a committal on that charge at the preliminary inquiry. Mr. Serrano’s counsel expressed concern that the issue of cocaine possession was raised at all, given that the parties had agreed to stay away from it, as it amounted to bad character evidence.

[31]                        Trial counsel indicated that she was unaware that the cocaine issue was off limits, even though she knew that the charges against Mr. Serrano had been withdrawn. Her position was that Mr. Serrano went to the club to sell cocaine to, or buy cocaine from, the security guard. She relied on the fact that cocaine was found on Mr. Serrano when he was arrested. She further pointed to a split‑second clip in the surveillance video where the guard and Mr. Serrano touched hands, suggesting that this was a drug deal.

[32]                        The trial judge watched the surveillance video clip twice and concluded that there was no foundation for trial counsel’s suggestion that there was a cocaine transaction between Mr. Serrano and the guard. The momentary touching of hands did not support an inference that any substance was exchanged, much less cocaine. She concluded that this line of questioning was irrelevant to the charges and “completely speculative”.

[33]                        Later in the cross-examination during another voir dire, trial counsel again maintained that she should be able to ask about the cocaine because it was in the disclosure material. The judge found that this information formed no part of the case. It had not been established and trial counsel had given no indication in the pre-trial form that she was going to be relying on discreditable conduct. The judge did not allow further cross-examination on this point.

(b)         The Trial Judge Did Not Err in Curtailing This Line of Questioning

[34]                        This ruling involved both an initial evidentiary ruling — that there was no good faith basis for the line of questioning — and a subsequent trial management decision — rejecting trial counsel’s renewed attempts to pursue this questioning.

[35]                        The trial judge’s initial evidentiary ruling discloses no error. She correctly assessed whether there was a good faith basis for the questions based on trial counsel’s articulated purpose. Trial judges should not have to go behind counsel’s articulated purpose when making a ruling. While judges may inquire into counsel’s proposed purpose, as a general rule, it is not their function to guess at or suggest more appropriate purposes than those proffered by counsel. In some cases, the purpose of a line of questioning may be apparent from the context, even where it has not been explicitly articulated. However, to ensure a fair trial, trial judges must be careful not to be seen as making arguments for a represented accused or the Crown. This is particularly important in a case like this, where the co-accused were running cut-throat defences.

[36]                        Nor is it the function of appellate judges to assume the role of trial counsel, formulating questions that counsel could have asked, identifying the legal basis for them, and making arguments that counsel could have made to show that they were permissible. Regrettably, the learned dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal did not heed this admonition. With respect, his reasons bear little relationship to the questions trial counsel sought to ask or the purposes articulated by her for asking them.

[37]                          Returning to the issue at hand, trial counsel repeatedly said that she wanted to ask about cocaine to demonstrate that Mr. Serrano went to the club to sell cocaine to, or buy cocaine from, the security guard. The trial judge was entitled to rely on the purpose articulated by counsel for the proposed line of questioning. Even though the judge did not explicitly use the words “good faith”, her findings demonstrate that she answered the correct question: Was there a reasonable inference available on the facts that there was a cocaine transaction between Mr. Serrano and the guard? The judge found that the drug deal hypothesis was “completely speculative” and without any basis after reviewing the surveillance video. This finding is tantamount to finding that no reasonable inference could be drawn and, therefore, that there was no good faith basis to ask the questions (R. v. Lyttle, 2004 SCC 5, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 193, at para. 48).

[38]                        When trial counsel revived her attempts to ask about the cocaine later on in the cross-examination, the trial judge reasonably exercised her trial management power to curtail irrelevant questioning that would not have furthered any issue at trial (Ivall, at para. 168). Her decision is owed deference and does not warrant intervention.

(2)         Whether the Security Guard Was “Scared” at Any Time During the Incident

(a)           Background and Ruling

[39]                        Trial counsel asked the security guard a series of questions, apparently designed to establish that he was lying about being “scared” at the club that night. She began by having him read out a portion of his police statement where, in response to being asked how he felt when Mr. Serrano dropped the gun beside him, he replied: “I was not scared, but surprised” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 82). Trial counsel then asked the guard to confirm that he said he was not scared. The guard agreed that he was not scared at that moment. Shortly thereafter, trial counsel suggested to him that he was not scared at all on the day of the incident. The guard agreed.

[40]                        Later on during a voir dire, Mr. Serrano’s counsel objected to trial counsel’s portrayal of the security guard’s evidence about not being scared during the incident. Specifically, Mr. Serrano’s counsel argued that it was unfair for trial counsel to maintain that the guard was not scared that day, based on an isolated portion of his police statement, where elsewhere in the statement, he said he was scared. Trial counsel agreed that there was another passage in the statement where the guard said he was scared.

[41]                        The judge found that it was unfair to excerpt parts of the police statement in a misleading way. She decided that the easiest way to deal with this problem was to provide a corrective instruction to the jury immediately, rather than take the security guard back to the confusing statement. She instructed the jury that, in addition to the passage trial counsel highlighted where the guard said he was not scared for his safety, there was another passage in his police statement where he said he was scared. Trial counsel did not object or express any disagreement with this instruction.

[42]                        Immediately following the corrective instruction, trial counsel asked the security guard if he agreed that there was a passage in his police statement where he said he was not scared and another passage where he said he was scared. The guard agreed.

(b)         The Trial Judge Did Not Err in Curtailing This Line of Questioning

[43]                        The judge’s trial management decision to curtail and clarify trial counsel’s misleading suggestion was reasonable and is owed deference. It was misleading to suggest that the security guard was not scared that day and only reference a passage of the police statement which supported this suggestion, knowing that elsewhere in the statement, he told the police he was scared. While not an irrelevant line of questioning, it would have been a needless waste of court time to allow trial counsel to pursue it, only to learn later that the questions were misleading and could only serve to distract or confuse the jury. The judge reasonably exercised her trial management power to stop this misleading questioning and correct it with an instruction to the jury.

[44]                        Mr. Samaniego suggests that it was wrong for the judge to provide the corrective instruction before the security guard formally adopted the passage in his police statement where he said he was scared. I disagree. There was no error for three reasons.

[45]                        First, directly after the instruction, trial counsel had the security guard adopt the passage of his police statement where he said he was scared. This momentary delay caused no prejudice to Mr. Samaniego.

[46]                        Second, all parties agreed that the security guard’s police statement contained a passage where he said that he was scared. Adopting the passage was an evidentiary formality in the circumstances.

[47]                        Third, trial counsel did not raise any objection to the judge providing a corrective instruction. This may have been a tactical choice because further highlighting the guard’s prior consistent statement would have undermined Mr. Samaniego’s overarching theory: that the guard was lying. While not determinative, lack of objection to the judge’s instruction is informative as to the materiality of an alleged error (R. v. Calnen, 2019 SCC 6, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 301, at para. 38).

[48]                        Mr. Samaniego suffered no unfairness from the judge drawing attention to a passage of the security guard’s police statement that he had not yet explicitly adopted. The judge was reasonably responding to misleading questioning by trial counsel. Any minor prejudice was fleeting because the guard adopted the passage from his statement immediately after the corrective instruction.

(3)         Whether the Security Guard “Refused” to Identify the Two Accused

(a)           Background and Ruling

[49]                        At trial, trial counsel attempted to confront the security guard with a line from his preliminary inquiry testimony, in which, according to counsel, he was “refusing” to identify the two accused. The trial judge did not allow the questions.

[50]                        On the first of several days of examination-in-chief at the preliminary inquiry, the security guard testified about his interactions with the two accused. The proceeding was adjourned in the middle of his examination-in-chief. Over four months later, the preliminary inquiry resumed and the Crown continued its examination‑in‑chief by reminding the guard that he had testified months earlier about his interactions with the two accused. The guard agreed. The Crown then showed him a surveillance video of the night in question.

[51]                        At the outset of the renewed questioning, the guard had difficulty identifying the persons in the video as the two accused. Crown counsel indicated that he had spoken with both defence counsel and it was agreed that the video showed the guard interacting with the two accused. The guard replied: “I do understand what you say, but the thing is that I’m not sure — I don’t recall really whether those are the same people” (R.R., vol. I, at p. 40). The Crown indicated again that there was no issue that the two people in the video were the two accused. The rest of the video was played and the guard answered questions in which he identified the two accused in the video. Trial counsel did not cross-examine him at the preliminary inquiry on any source of confusion regarding identification.

[52]                        At trial, however, she sought to cross-examine the guard on his evidence from the preliminary inquiry in which he testified that he could not recall whether the two accused were the persons in the video. In a voir dire to determine the propriety of a proposed line of questioning, she told the trial judge that she intended to ask the security guard about this aspect of his testimony because it demonstrated that he did not want to identify the two accused. The judge reiterated that identity was admitted. She ruled that trial counsel could not pluck a line from the preliminary inquiry testimony that was not relevant to an issue at trial, nor pursued as an issue at the preliminary inquiry.

[53]                        Later on during the voir dire, trial counsel tried to revive this line of questioning, maintaining that at the preliminary inquiry, the security guard was “refusing to identify” the two accused in the video (A.R., vol. II, at p. 190). Again, the judge reiterated that identification of the two accused was not an issue and that trial counsel had not pursued it as an issue at the preliminary inquiry.

(b)         The Trial Judge Did Not Err in Curtailing This Line of Questioning

[54]                        The trial judge appropriately prevented trial counsel from pursuing this misleading line of questioning. The judge was entitled to rely on trial counsel’s articulated purpose for her questions. Trial counsel’s purpose was to suggest that the security guard refused to identify the two accused at the preliminary inquiry. This was simply not true. The guard’s comment about not recalling whether the two persons in the video were the two accused must be taken in context. At the preliminary inquiry, the guard identified the two accused as those involved in the incident, both before and after the impugned comment. To suggest he refused to identify the accused was misleading.

[55]                        Furthermore, if there was any concern that the security guard was refusing to identify the two accused, this concern was dispelled at trial. The guard identified the two accused as the persons in the surveillance video near the beginning of his examination-in-chief. There was no issue that the guard could not, or would not, identify the accused as the two persons in the video.

[56]                        The judge reasonably exercised her trial management power to curtail this misleading and irrelevant line of questioning. Her decision is owed deference. The questions were not relevant to the resolution of any live issues in the case. Rather, they were misleading, wasteful of court time, and disruptive to the jury. Mr. Samaniego was entitled to a fair trial, not an endless one (Ivall, at para. 168).

(4)         Who Dropped the Gun and Who Picked It Up

(a)           Background and Ruling

[57]                        Shortly after the incident at the club, the security guard told the police in a recorded statement that Mr. Serrano dropped the gun in front of him at the club and picked it back up. At the preliminary inquiry, the guard initially testified that he was unsure who dropped the gun and picked it up. The Crown tried to refresh his memory by asking him to read his police statement. He testified that he still did not remember.

[58]                        The Crown then asked the guard to reread a portion of his police statement. The security guard testified that he could not really remember what happened because it was a long time ago, but he confirmed that his memory was fresher when he gave his police statement. In the face of this response, the Crown sought and received permission from the preliminary inquiry judge to have his statement on this point entered into evidence as past recollection recorded — a method of refreshing the memory of a witness who does not have a present recollection of an event by having them adopt a document that reliably recorded their memory at or around the time of the event (D. M. Paciocco, P. Paciocco and L. Stuesser, The Law of Evidence (8th ed. 2020), at pp. 539-40).

[59]                        At trial, the security guard testified in accordance with his police statement: that Mr. Serrano dropped the gun and picked it up. Trial counsel confronted the guard with the contrary evidence he had initially given at the preliminary inquiry and asked: “. . . why did you not tell what you’re telling us today or yesterday?” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 177).

[60]                        Crown counsel objected. She submitted that this was not a fair question because the security guard had adopted his police statement at the preliminary inquiry as past recollection recorded due to a genuine memory lapse. It was misleading for trial counsel to suggest that he was lying by not giving the same version of events at trial as he did at the preliminary inquiry. The Crown suggested that trial counsel “can put to the witness that his memory was fading on some aspects at the preliminary inquiry and ask him why he remembers those portions today, but not to say he was lying at the preliminary inquiry” (p. 184).

[61]                        The judge agreed that trial counsel could challenge the security guard on the contents of his police statement and on his failing memory. She could not, however, question him about his first version of events before adopting his police statement as past recollection recorded. The trial judge decided that, since the preliminary inquiry judge ruled that the guard’s police statement was his evidence on that point, she could not go “back behind that ruling” (p. 184).

(b)         The Trial Judge Erred in Curtailing This Line of Questioning

[62]                        The trial judge’s ruling had two aspects. The first was an unproblematic trial management ruling targeting misleading questioning that would have confused the jury and needlessly prolonged the trial. The judge reasonably ruled that trial counsel could not pursue a line of questioning designed to show that the security guard had not told the same story at trial as he did at the preliminary inquiry. This was a misleading suggestion because the guard did tell the same story at trial and at the preliminary inquiry — both times in accordance with his police statement. While it was true that he offered a contrary story at the preliminary inquiry before adopting his police statement, trial counsel was not seeking to expose the inconsistent versions given at the preliminary inquiry. Rather, her suggestion implied that he said only one thing at the preliminary inquiry and the opposite at trial. This was simply not true.

[63]                        The trial judge was entitled to rely on trial counsel’s framing of her proposed line of questioning. She did so and reasonably concluded that it was misleading to suggest that the security guard lied at trial and/or the preliminary inquiry by not telling the same story. That was a misleading characterization of the facts. As such, she was entitled to exercise her trial management power to curtail the proposed questions that, while not irrelevant, unfairly characterized the facts to the point that asking them would have been more distracting than informative (John, at para. 60). She did, however, allow trial counsel leeway to reframe her questions to ask the guard about his failing memory. This aspect of her ruling reveals no error.

[64]                        The second, and more problematic, aspect of the trial judge’s ruling was her further restriction of any cross-examination about the security guard’s preliminary inquiry testimony prior to his adoption of his police statement. This was an evidentiary ruling, reviewable on a correctness standard. It was incorrect for the judge to tell trial counsel she could not go “behind” the preliminary inquiry judge’s ruling on past recollection recorded. Trial judges are not bound by evidentiary rulings made at the preliminary inquiry. More importantly, the guard’s adoption of his police statement as true did not erase his different initial version of events. With respect, the trial judge erred in holding that there was no inconsistency trial counsel could probe, had she sought to do so. The remaining question is whether this error was fatal. In my view, it was not.

D.           The Curative Proviso Applies

[65]                        The curative proviso set out in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code allows a court of appeal to dismiss an appeal from conviction where “no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred”. The Crown may rely on the curative proviso where the error is harmless or trivial or where the evidence is so overwhelming that a conviction was inevitable (R. v. Sekhon, 2014 SCC 15, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 272, at para. 53). No one suggests that the evidence in this case was overwhelming; accordingly, our sole concern is whether the error was harmless or trivial, such that there is no reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been different had it not been made (R. v. R.V., 2019 SCC 41, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 237, at para. 85; R. v. Khan, 2001 SCC 86, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 823, at para. 28).

[66]                        The Crown raised the curative proviso for the first time in oral submissions. Even though it was not raised in its factum, this does not necessarily bar its application. Appellate courts may apply the curative proviso if the Crown has implicitly raised it by arguing, in essence, that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred or that the evidence of guilt is so overwhelming such that the verdict would have been the same (R. v. Ajise, 2018 SCC 51, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 301, at para. 1, aff’g 2018 ONCA 494, 361 C.C.C. (3d) 384, at para. 32; R. v. Cole, 2021 ONCA 759, at paras. 155-58 (CanLII); R. v. Hudson, 2020 ONCA 507, 391 C.C.C. (3d) 208, at para. 49). Though it would have been preferable had the Crown raised the proviso in its factum, I am satisfied that the content of its factum and the invocation of the proviso in oral argument allows this Court to consider it. There is no prejudice to Mr. Samaniego. Experienced appellate counsel representing him made submissions on the proviso in his main argument and again in reply. He did not submit that we should bar the Crown from raising it. In any event, even if he had, I would have granted leave to the Crown to do so in the interests of justice.

[67]                        In support of its position, the Crown submits that the incorrect curtailment of one line of questioning, designed to impeach the security guard’s credibility, would not have impacted the result. Trial counsel was able to effectively challenge the guard’s faulty memory on the point in issue — who dropped the gun and who picked it up — and used this to cast doubt on the overall credibility and reliability of the guard’s evidence.

[68]                        Mr. Samaniego, on the other hand, submits that any improper curtailment of cross-examination in a case where credibility is the central issue should result in a new trial. Being prevented from pursuing a valuable line of inquiry to further his pivotal theory that the security guard was lying constitutes reversible error. With respect, I would not give effect to his submissions for three reasons.

[69]                        First, both in cross-examination and her closing address, trial counsel brought home to the jury, in no uncertain terms, the primary theory of Mr. Samaniego’s defence, namely that the security guard was lying to protect his good friend, Mr. Serrano. Trial counsel vigorously and repeatedly attacked the guard’s credibility in cross-examination. In total, she spent one and a half days challenging his credibility on virtually every facet of his evidence. On three occasions, she put the primary theory of Mr. Samaniego’s defence directly to him. In the context of this lengthy cross‑examination, one further opportunity to attack the guard’s credibility would, in my view, have been all but inconsequential in advancing the primary theory of Mr. Samaniego’s defence. There was no mystery about it; even Mr. Serrano’s counsel and the Crown drew the jury’s attention to it in their closing addresses. If the jury knew nothing else, they knew that Mr. Samaniego’s defence hinged on undermining the credibility of the security guard by showing that he and Mr. Serrano were good friends and the guard was lying about Mr. Samaniego’s involvement to protect Mr. Serrano.

[70]                        The jury’s evident knowledge of the primary theory of Mr. Samaniego’s defence distinguishes this case from Lyttle, where the trial judge prohibited defence counsel from advancing their primary theory aimed at undermining the credibility of a key witness. Indeed, the judge threatened a mistrial if defence counsel ignored his ruling. On appeal to this Court, the line of questioning that Mr. Lyttle’s defence counsel sought to pursue was found to be proper. As such, the trial judge’s ruling effectively deprived Mr. Lyttle from presenting the primary theory of his defence to the jury. In those circumstances, it goes without saying that the proviso could not reasonably apply. That is a far cry from this case. Here, Mr. Samaniego was able to advance the primary theory of his defence without hindrance.

[71]                        Let me be clear. There is no categorical rule that any improper interference with cross-examination bars application of the proviso. I need look no further than this Court’s recent decision in R.V. Writing for a majority of the Court, Karakatsanis J. applied the proviso, despite finding that defence counsel’s cross-examination was improperly curtailed on a point that was highly relevant, and indeed critical, to defence counsel’s attack on the complainant’s credibility (paras. 7 and 98). As is the case here, Karakatsanis J. found that enough cross-examination was permitted — and occurred — which “allowed the defence to test the evidence with sufficient rigour” (para. 9). In both this case and R.V., the triers of fact were well aware of the critical defence theory based on the questions defence counsel were allowed to ask (para. 98).

[72]                        Second, on the facts of this case, any possible prejudice arising from this single misstep by the trial judge would have been minimal. Had trial counsel been able to probe the security guard on his inconsistent accounts at the preliminary inquiry, in my view, this would not have furthered Mr. Samaniego’s primary theory; on the contrary, it would have worked against it.

[73]                        At every step of the way, the security guard’s account of who dropped and picked up the gun served to incriminate Mr. Serrano, not vindicate him. Beginning with the police interrogation, had the guard wanted to protect Mr. Serrano, surely he would not have told the police that it was Mr. Serrano who dropped the gun in front of him and picked it up. Putting the gun in Mr. Serrano’s hand incriminated him. At the preliminary inquiry, the guard retreated from his initial testimony that he could not remember who dropped and picked up the gun; in its place, he adopted his police statement that it was Mr. Serrano who did so. Again, this did not help Mr. Serrano, it incriminated him. And finally at trial, the guard testified in accordance with his police statement — again incriminating Mr. Serrano. Viewed in this light, it is fanciful to think that Mr. Samaniego’s primary theory would have been furthered had trial counsel been allowed to probe the discrepancy about who dropped the gun and who picked it up.

[74]                        Finally, it is speculative to suggest that trial counsel would have even asked the security guard about why he gave two versions of events at the preliminary inquiry. At no point during the lengthy voir dire did trial counsel indicate that she wanted to ask this question. She repeatedly told the judge that her proposed questioning concerned the security guard’s failing memory between the preliminary inquiry and trial — questioning that the trial judge allowed. She focused on the fact that the guard adopted his police statement as past recollection recorded at the preliminary inquiry because he could not remember who dropped and picked up the gun, whereas at trial, he could remember. The trial judge allowed this questioning so long as trial counsel stayed away from the guard’s version of the events before the past recollection recorded ruling. In doing so, the judge was entitled to rely on trial counsel’s articulation of the purpose for the questions, without fear of being second-guessed on appeal.

[75]                        While the judge should not have curtailed cross-examination on the security guard’s version of events before the past recollection recorded ruling, there is no indication that trial counsel intended to ask such questions. It is speculative, at best, to suggest that she would likely have pursued this line of questioning when she made no attempt to do so at any point in her cross-examination.

[76]                        Mr. Samaniego was entitled to a fair trial, not a perfect trial (R. v. Harrer, 1995 CanLII 70 (SCC), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 562, at para. 45). My colleagues refrain from deciding whether the trial judge erred in the other three impugned rulings. Instead, they focus on one mistake, arising out of one ruling, on one area of cross-examination — and maintain that Mr. Samaniego did not receive a fair trial. While one error may be enough in some circumstances to render a trial unfair, I am not persuaded that the single error here was enough. Viewed properly in the context of the trial as a whole, the jury had what they needed to infer that the guard may not have been telling the truth about who dropped the gun and who picked it up.

[77]                        My colleagues and I agree that an accused’s right to cross-examination is a fundamental part of full answer and defence, but that this right is not unlimited (Côté and Rowe JJ.’s reasons, at para. 183). We also agree that the curative proviso can only rarely apply in cases where cross-examination has been improperly curtailed (para. 170; R.V., at para. 86). But we part company as to whether this is one of those rare cases where the error was harmless and the proviso can apply. In my view, for the reasons I have provided in paras. 69-75, it is.

[78]                        Overall, I am satisfied that the judge’s technical error caused no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. It is difficult to see how the prejudice alleged by Mr. Samaniego materialized. Trial counsel was able to vigorously challenge the security guard’s credibility and repeatedly emphasize the primary defence theory that he was lying to protect Mr. Serrano. Furthermore, there was no indication that she wanted to ask the questions improperly barred by the trial judge. Even if she did want to pursue the line of questioning barred by the judge, this would likely have undermined — rather than supported — the primary theory advanced by Mr. Samaniego. In the context of this trial, the trial judge’s error was harmless and would not have affected the outcome. There was no miscarriage of justice.

V.           Disposition

[79]                        I would dismiss Mr. Samaniego’s appeal and affirm his conviction.

I.               Introduction

[80]                        Trial judges have the authority to control the proceedings over which they preside. Through the exercise of their “trial management” powers, courts can promote efficient adjudication by controlling how parties present their case. But these trial management powers end where the law of evidence begins. Rulings on the admissibility of real or oral evidence, including rulings on permissible lines of cross‑examination, are evidentiary decisions. The propriety of those rulings is governed by the rules of evidence, not the court’s trial management authority.

[81]                          As this case demonstrates, an overly broad and haphazard approach to trial management powers undermines trial predictability and consistency, and an accused’s right to make full answer and defence. Most litigation is a truth-seeking exercise. Cases typically turn on a dispute about the facts, not on disagreements about what the law requires. The rules of evidence outline how parties can establish the facts needed to build their case. In a predictable manner, it lets parties know what information they can present to support their case, how they can tender this information, and what use they can make of this information once admitted. These rules cannot be ignored because a trial judge is presiding over a difficult or complex case. Excluding relevant and material evidence under the guise of a trial judge’s trial management powers creates legal uncertainty and undermines an accused’s right to make full answer and defence. That is what occurred here.

[82]                          The appellant, Victor Samaniego, and his co-accused, Jose Patricio Serrano, were charged with possession of a loaded restricted firearm. The only issue at trial was who had possession of the gun outside of a nightclub. Mr. Samaniego and Mr. Serrano each ran a “cut-throat” defence, accusing the other of bringing the gun to the nightclub.

[83]                          The only evidence linking Mr. Samaniego to possession of the gun was the testimony of the nightclub’s security guard. His credibility was the most important issue at trial.

[84]                          At trial, the trial judge made four impugned rulings during Mr. Samaniego’s cross-examination of the security guard. For the purposes of this appeal, it is sufficient to consider only one of these rulings: the trial judge’s exclusion of a prior inconsistent statement by the security guard made at the preliminary inquiry about who dropped and picked up the gun. At the preliminary inquiry, the security guard initially testified that he did not see who dropped and picked up the gun outside of the nightclub. At trial, he testified that Mr. Serrano dropped and picked up the gun. Mr. Samaniego sought to impugn the security guard’s credibility with this inconsistency, but the trial judge prevented him from doing so. We do not discuss the other three impugned rulings, as it is unnecessary to do so.

[85]                          Mr. Samaniego and Mr. Serrano were both convicted. On appeal, Mr. Samaniego challenged the four mid-trial rulings, including the ruling above. A majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. They labelled all of the trial judge’s rulings as harmless “trial management” decisions. The dissenting judge disagreed. In his view, the impugned rulings were incorrect evidentiary decisions, not trial management decisions. Since these rulings deprived Mr. Samaniego of highly probative evidence, a new trial was necessary.

[86]                          We would allow the appeal. In our view, the trial management powers cannot be used to exclude relevant, material, and otherwise admissible evidence. The trial judge’s ruling improperly prevented Mr. Samaniego from pursuing a highly relevant and material line of questioning. It was therefore an erroneous evidentiary ruling, not a trial management decision. Contrary to the trial judge’s reasons, the fact that the security guard’s police statement was admitted for the truth of its contents did not erase the security guard’s initial inconsistent preliminary inquiry testimony. The trial judge erred by concluding otherwise.

[87]                        This error cannot be saved by the curative proviso. The error was significant. The Crown’s case against Mr. Samaniego turned entirely on the security guard’s credibility. Any inconsistency in the security guard’s testimony was therefore highly relevant to Mr. Samaniego’s defence. But an inconsistency going to the heart of the indictment — who had possession of the gun — was the most important type of testimonial inconsistency that defence counsel could hope to explore. This is especially so given the facts of this case, as the security guard’s initial unwillingness to incriminate his friend, Mr. Serrano, at the preliminary inquiry until he was confronted with a contradictory police statement buttressed Mr. Samaniego’s central defence theory: that the security guard was willing to testify falsely in order to protect Mr. Serrano.

[88]                          The significant harm flowing from this error was not diminished by the fact that Mr. Samaniego could impugn the security guard’s credibility in other ways. An effective cross-examination often involves a coordinated series of attacks that, cumulatively, undermine the witness’s credibility. The right to make full answer and defence therefore entitles an accused to explore all inconsistencies and lines of credibility attack, within evidentiary limits. Mr. Samaniego was unfairly deprived of this right. The curative proviso is therefore inapplicable.

[89]                          It follows that we would set aside Mr. Samaniego’s conviction and order a new trial.

II.            Background

[90]                        Mr. Samaniego was charged with possession of a loaded restricted firearm, contrary to s. 95(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46. He was jointly tried with Mr. Serrano, who was charged with the same offence. The trial took place with a jury and both men were convicted. The key issue at trial was whether one or both of the co-accused possessed the gun outside of a nightclub in Toronto.

[91]                        The events in question took place on August 17, 2015. Police were called and informed about a gun outside of a nightclub. When police arrived and approached Mr. Samaniego and Mr. Serrano, Mr. Serrano was in possession of the gun. Police observed Mr. Serrano throwing the gun away, but it was recovered shortly thereafter.

[92]                        The Crown’s theory at trial was that Mr. Samaniego and Mr. Serrano went to the nightclub together, with Mr. Samaniego initially in possession of the gun. The Crown relied heavily on the testimony of the security guard at the nightclub. The security guard testified that he denied Mr. Samaniego entry due to a previous incident between the two and that, in response, Mr. Samaniego threatened him and lifted his shirt to reveal a gun in his waistband. The security guard testified that Mr. Serrano then took possession of the gun from Mr. Samaniego. Mr. Serrano subsequently dropped the gun and picked it up, at which point the police were called.

[93]                        Mr. Samaniego and Mr. Serrano each ran a “cut-throat” defence, accusing the other of having brought the gun to the nightclub. Mr. Serrano’s position was that he took the gun away from Mr. Samaniego after the altercation with the security guard. Mr. Samaniego’s position was that he never had possession of the gun and that he did not even know about it until Mr. Serrano dropped it. Mr. Samaniego testified at the trial, while Mr. Serrano did not testify.

[94]                        The security guard’s testimony was crucial to the Crown’s case against Mr. Samaniego as well as Mr. Serrano’s defence. While the Crown tendered three surveillance clips that captured some of the events in question, none depicted Mr. Samaniego in possession of the gun. The security guard’s testimony was the only evidence at trial directly linking Mr. Samaniego to the gun.

[95]                        Mr. Samaniego’s defence therefore centred on undermining the security guard’s credibility. A key line of attack was Mr. Serrano and the security guard’s close personal relationship. Whereas the security guard and Mr. Samaniego had a history of animosity, the security guard and Mr. Serrano had been good friends for 10 years. Mr. Samaniego thus sought to establish that the security guard was giving biased and inaccurate testimony in order to protect his friend. Mr. Samaniego’s counsel also relied on the security guard’s police statement and his preliminary inquiry testimony, highlighting purported inconsistencies with his testimony at trial in order to undermine his credibility.

[96]                        Throughout the trial, the trial judge made a number of rulings that circumscribed defence counsel’s ability to challenge the credibility of the security guard on cross-examination. For the purposes of this appeal, it is sufficient to consider only one of these rulings: the trial judge’s exclusion of a prior inconsistent statement by the security guard made at the preliminary inquiry about who dropped and picked up the gun.

A.           Exclusion of the Preliminary Inquiry Testimony About Who Had the Gun

[97]                        At the preliminary inquiry, the security guard initially testified that he did not see who dropped the gun or who picked it up afterward. In his examination‑in‑chief, the Crown asked where the gun fell from. The security guard answered: “I did not see it exactly. Both of them were there. Like, so, I don’t know” (R.R., vol. I, at p. 20).

[98]                        The security guard maintained this position the following day at the preliminary inquiry, even after being furnished with his police statement. When the Crown resumed questioning about who picked up the gun after it fell, the security guard reiterated that he “didn’t see exactly who was the one holding the gun. Or rather, had the — the gun” (p. 24). The Crown asked whether he observed either of the two individuals do anything with the gun after it fell. He answered: “No. No, I didn’t see anything. I don’t know what they did with it. I — I don’t know” (p. 24). The Crown asked specifically whether anything in his police statement refreshed his memory about the details of what happened after the gun fell. He answered: “No, it’s the same thing. I — I did not see exactly where it came from or what happened. I mean, I do not know what happened with the gun once it was picked up. I don’t know” (pp. 24-25). Again, the Crown asked who picked up the gun. He answered: “I don’t know exactly because the one who was threaten[ing] me, this is the one I have a problem with. This is the one I was focussing on” (p. 25).

[99]                        This testimony was inconsistent with the security guard’s police statement, which was taken shortly after the incident. That statement indicated that Mr. Serrano dropped and picked up the gun. The security guard’s statement described two men who came to the nightclub: one who was wearing a baseball hat and the other who was not allowed to come in because the security guard had previously had an incident with him. The security guard’s police statement stated that the “guy with [the] baseball hat dropped the gun on the floor. He looked at me, picked up the gun and walk[ed] south of Rivalda Rd.”: p. 3. There is no dispute that Mr. Serrano was the man wearing a baseball hat.

[100]                     In light of the contradiction between the security guard’s police statement and his preliminary inquiry testimony, the Crown successfully brought an application to have the security guard’s police statement — in which he said Mr. Serrano dropped and picked up the gun — admitted at the preliminary inquiry pursuant to the “past recollection recorded” exception to the hearsay rule.

[101]                     At trial, the security guard testified consistently with his police statement and said that Mr. Serrano dropped and picked up the gun. When Mr. Samaniego’s counsel sought to cross-examine the security guard on his initial inconsistent preliminary inquiry testimony, the Crown and Mr. Serrano’s counsel objected. During the subsequent voir dire, the trial judge was alerted to the inconsistency between the security guard’s preliminary inquiry evidence and his trial evidence. The trial judge agreed that there was an inconsistency. The jury and witness were recalled and Mr. Samaniego’s counsel resumed her questioning of the security guard. She asked the security guard about his initial preliminary inquiry evidence. After reading out portions of his preliminary inquiry testimony, Mr. Samaniego’s counsel asked the security guard: “So, sir, my question to you, why did you not tell what you’re telling us today or yesterday?” (R.R., vol. III, at p. 55).

[102]                     The Crown again objected, asserting that the question was unfair because the witness had subsequently adopted his police statement at the preliminary inquiry. The jury and witness were excused again for another voir dire. The trial judge inquired further about the preliminary inquiry judge’s ruling, learning that the preliminary inquiry judge determined that the security guard had a genuine memory loss and admitted the police statement on this point for the truth of its contents. The trial judge then reasoned that this line of cross-examination was unfair, as there was no inconsistency with his preliminary inquiry testimony and his trial testimony (because the security guard eventually adopted his police statement during his preliminary inquiry testimony). She ruled that defence counsel could not put the prior inconsistent statement to the witness.

[103]                     Defence counsel protested the ruling. She maintained that she was entitled to challenge the security guard on his purported lack of memory. She also explained, in response to further questions from the trial judge, that the line of questioning was relevant because it suggested that the security guard initially refused to give incriminating testimony against Mr. Serrano. Specifically, defence counsel explained that the security guard’s initial testimony at the preliminary inquiry showed that he “refused to identify the — who the person who dropped the gun but now he’s able to recall directly”: R.R., vol. III, at pp. 74‑75. Nevertheless, the trial judge refused to allow defence counsel to pursue this line of questioning on the grounds that it would undercut the preliminary inquiry judge’s ruling. She reiterated that this issue had already been addressed by the preliminary inquiry judge and held that while Mr. Samaniego’s counsel could ask about the security guard’s memory loss generally, counsel could not “go to the specifics of what [the security guard] said before that application was made”: p. 75.

[104]                     The jury was then recalled and given a mid-trial jury instruction to disregard any inconsistency between the security guard’s preliminary inquiry and trial testimony. The trial judge explained that the security guard needed to have his memory refreshed at the preliminary inquiry and that he adopted his police statement. She charged the jury that, because the police statement was adopted as the security guard’s evidence at the preliminary inquiry, “any reference made by [Mr. Samaniego’s counsel] today to the preliminary inquiry evidence about [the security guard’s] uncertainty about who he saw holding the gun, must be completely disregarded by you and must have no part in your consideration or deliberation about this case”: pp. 83‑84 (emphasis added). This was repeated in the charge to the jury at the end of trial.

[105]                     The jury convicted both Mr. Samaniego and Mr. Serrano.

[106]                     Mr. Samaniego appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The trial judge’s ruling preventing him from cross-examining the security guard on this inconsistency formed one of his main grounds of appeal. For the purposes of this appeal, we will refer to this issue as the “Inconsistent Possession Testimony”.

III.         Decision Below (2020 ONCA 439, 151 O.R. (3d) 449)

A.           Benotto J.A. (Thorburn J.A. Concurring)

[107]                     A majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. In their view, all the impugned mid-trial rulings were discretionary trial management decisions and entitled to deference. Since none of these decisions “deprive[d] the appellant of material evidence necessary for his defence”, there was no need for a new trial: para. 1.

[108]                     The majority found no issue with the trial judge’s Inconsistent Possession Testimony ruling for three reasons. First, defence counsel framed her questions as going to memory, rather than an attack on the security guard’s credibility. Second, the police statement formed part of the security guard’s testimony at the preliminary inquiry. Therefore, the security guard “gave the same testimony at trial as he did at the preliminary inquiry”: para. 41. Third, this ruling did not result in any trial unfairness. Mr. Samaniego could explore other inconsistencies in the security guard’s testimony. He could also explore the suggestion that the security guard’s testimony was tailored to assist Mr. Serrano at other points in the trial.

B.            Paciocco J.A. (Dissenting)

[109]                     Paciocco J.A. would have allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction, and ordered a new trial. He disagreed with the majority’s characterization of the impugned rulings as trial management decisions. In his view, the impugned rulings were all evidentiary rulings governed by the law of evidence. As the impugned rulings were legally incorrect and deprived Mr. Samaniego of probative evidence that could undermine the security guard’s credibility, a new trial was necessary.

[110]                     On the Inconsistent Possession Testimony ruling, Paciocco J.A. concluded that the trial judge erred by preventing defence counsel from exploring this inconsistency. The inconsistency in the security guard’s testimony was plain. The security guard testified at the preliminary inquiry that he did not see who had the gun. At trial, he said that Mr. Serrano was the one who dropped and picked it up. This inconsistency was not erased by the subsequent adoption of the police statement at the preliminary inquiry. The trial judge was not bound by the preliminary inquiry judge’s evidentiary ruling and she erred by resting her decision on this basis.

[111]                     Paciocco J.A. also disagreed with the majority’s conclusion that defence counsel framed her questions as going solely to memory. Although it could have been better expressed, defence counsel was clearly trying to establish that the security guard’s initial preliminary inquiry testimony was a deliberate choice to protect Mr. Serrano, not a situation of genuine memory loss. This was evident from defence counsel’s explanation of the relevance of the questioning, where she said it showed that the security guard initially “refused to identify” who dropped the gun. This was also clear from defence counsel’s overall trial strategy: establish that the security guard was testifying falsely to assist his friend, Mr. Serrano.

IV.         Parties’ Submissions

A.           Appellant, Mr. Samaniego

[112]                     Mr. Samaniego submits that the trial judge made incorrect evidentiary rulings that deprived him of the ability to mount a full defence. The majority of the Court of Appeal improperly saved these rulings by concluding that they were trial management decisions and entitled to appellate deference. These were evidentiary rulings. Their propriety needed to be assessed against the law of evidence.

[113]                     The trial judge made two errors in her ruling on the Inconsistent Possession Testimony. First, she incorrectly concluded that the security guard’s initial inconsistent statement was erased by his subsequent adoption of the police statement. Second, she incorrectly concluded that she was bound by the preliminary inquiry judge’s evidentiary ruling.

[114]                     The Court of Appeal erred by saving this ruling on the grounds that no unfairness resulted from this decision. While the trial judge allowed defence counsel to ask the security guard about his lack of memory in general terms, that was not enough for an effective cross-examination. An effective cross‑examination needs to refer to specific inconsistencies, not general questions.

B.            Intervener, the Criminal Lawyers’ Association (Ontario)

[115]                     The Criminal Lawyers’ Association (Ontario) (“CLAO”) intervenes and asks this Court to provide guidance on the scope of a trial judge’s trial management powers. The CLAO is concerned with what it sees as a growing trend, exemplified by the Court of Appeal’s majority reasons, to expand trial management powers and blend them with a trial judge’s power to make evidentiary rulings. It asks that this Court hold that trial management powers end where the rules of evidence begin.

C.            Respondent, the Crown

[116]                     The Crown submits that the trial judge’s impugned rulings were all properly grounded in the “undisputed authority of the trial judge to manage the trial” and curtail improper cross-examination: R.F., at para. 25. There were no errors in her reasons. The rulings were based on the record as it was unfolding and on the submissions made by defence counsel, which both the majority and the dissenting judge found confusing and unfocused. The rulings need to be assessed with this context in mind.

[117]                     There was no error in the trial judge’s Inconsistent Possession Testimony ruling. Defence counsel did not clearly articulate that she was trying to highlight inconsistencies in the security guard’s testimony with the line of questioning. The trial judge simply intervened to clarify the record after defence counsel inaccurately summarized the evidence at the preliminary inquiry. The trial judge was entitled to intervene on this basis.

[118]                     The Crown also rejects the CLAO’s position that trial management powers and evidentiary rulings are separate and distinct concepts. These powers often overlap. For example, trial judges can limit vexatious, abusive, repetitive, misleading, or overly lengthy cross-examination through their trial management powers. These rulings, however, inevitably curtail cross-examination on evidence that would otherwise be admissible. It is therefore impractical to create silos between these two powers. The Crown asks this Court to affirm the current state of the law, which it reads as recognizing some inevitable overlap between trial management powers and evidentiary rulings.

[119]                     Finally, the Crown submits that this Court does not have jurisdiction to hear this appeal. To engage this Court’s jurisdiction under s. 691(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, there must be a disagreement on a “question of law” between the majority and a dissenting judge at a court of appeal that impacted the disposition of the appeal. The dispute between the majority and the dissenting judge at the Court of Appeal in this case does not raise a question of law. Their disagreement revolves around their respective assessment of the factual record underpinning the trial judge’s rulings.

V.           Issues on Appeal

[120]                     The following issues must be considered in this appeal:

A.                     Does this appeal raise a question of law such that this Court has jurisdiction to hear the matter?

B.                     Did the majority of the Court of Appeal err in finding that the trial judge’s Inconsistent Possession Testimony ruling was a proper exercise of her trial management powers and subject to deference?

C.                     Did the majority of the Court of Appeal err in finding that the impugned ruling did not impact trial fairness, such that a new trial is warranted?

VI.         Analysis

A.           Issue 1: This Court Has Jurisdiction to Hear the Appeal

[121]                     This Court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal. The Crown argues that the propriety of judicial interventions in a cross-examination does not raise a question of law alone, and therefore this Court does not have jurisdiction: Fanjoy v. The Queen, 1985 CanLII 53 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 233, at pp. 238-39; R. v. Khanna, 2016 ONCA 39, at para. 9 (CanLII).

[122]                     We would reject this submission. In R. v. Biniaris, 2000 SCC 15, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, this Court adopted a generous approach to jurisdiction, holding that the application of a legal standard to the facts of the case raises a question of law: para. 23; see also R. v. Shepherd, 2009 SCC 35, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 527, at para. 20. It is of no moment that the issue may be characterized as not being a “question of law alone”.

[123]                     The case currently before this Court clearly raises issues about the application of legal standards: the overarching dispute in this appeal is whether the trial judge properly applied the standard for the admissibility of evidence and the standard for intervening in the cross-examination of a Crown witness. This Court has jurisdiction.

B.            Issue 2: The Trial Judge’s Inconsistent Possession Testimony Ruling Was Not a Trial Management Decision

(1)         Trial Management Powers and the Law of Evidence Must Be Kept Separate and Distinct

[124]                     As this case illustrates, there is uncertainty about whether a trial judge can exclude relevant and material evidence through their trial management powers. The majority of the Court of Appeal held that each of the impugned trial rulings were “trial management decisions within the discretion of the trial judge” and entitled to appellate deference: para. 1. The dissenting judge disagreed, labelling the rulings as evidentiary decisions. Accordingly, this appeal calls for discussion on the scope of a trial judge’s trial management powers, and its relationship to the law of evidence.

[125]                     Trial judges have the authority to control the proceeding over which they preside. They should control, direct, and administer the trial in an effective and efficient way: R. v. John, 2017 ONCA 622, 350 C.C.C. (3d) 397, at para. 47; R. v. Potter, 2020 NSCA 9, 385 C.C.C. (3d) 1, at para. 748. Among other powers, trial management authority allows trial judges to place reasonable limits on oral submissions, direct written submissions, defer rulings, decline to hear frivolous motions after hearing from the parties, and, exceptionally, direct the order in which evidence is called: R. v. Felderhof (2003), 2003 CanLII 37346 (ON CA), 68 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.), at para. 57; R. v. Cody, 2017 SCC 31, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 659, at paras. 38-39; R. v. Greer, 2020 ONCA 795, 397 C.C.C. (3d) 40, at para. 110. Appellate courts should defer to proper trial management decisions: R. v. Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631, at para. 139.

[126]                     Trial management authority should not, however, be used to exclude relevant, material, and otherwise admissible evidence. Some provincial appellate courts have already recognized that excluding evidence under the guise of trial management powers would be an “unusual exercise” of those powers: R. v. Horan, 2008 ONCA 589, 237 C.C.C. (3d) 514, at para. 33; R. v. Spackman, 2012 ONCA 905, 295 C.C.C. (3d) 177, at para. 104; see also R. v. Nield, 2019 BCCA 27, 372 C.C.C. (3d) 375, at para. 74. We would go a step further. In our view, trial management powers can never be used to exclude relevant and material evidence. Rulings on the admissibility of real or oral evidence, including rulings on permissible lines of cross-examination, are evidentiary decisions. The propriety of those rulings is governed by the rules of evidence, not the court’s trial management authority.

[127]                     This conclusion is supported by the leading authority on trial management powers, Felderhof. Felderhof involved a complex prosecution for violations under the Securities Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5. After 70 days of trial, counsel for the Ontario Securities Commission (“OSC”) applied to halt the prosecution and have the trial begin anew before another trial judge. Among other issues, the OSC argued that the trial judge erred by directing that the OSC, contrary to its wishes, call its next witness rather than proceed with an omnibus motion on the admissibility of various documents. The trial judge reasoned that hearing from the witness before ruling on the documents would be a more efficient use of court time. On appeal from the order dismissing its application, the OSC argued that the trial judge had no authority to override its right to present its case as it sought fit, absent an abuse of process or breach of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

[128]                     Writing for a unanimous court, Rosenberg J.A. found no error in the trial judge’s order. He held that the power to issue this direction was grounded in the trial court’s inherent jurisdiction to control its own process. It was in this context that Rosenberg J.A. defined the scope of a trial judge’s “trial management” powers as follows:

I think something should be said about the trial management power. It is neither necessary nor possible to exhaustively define its content or its limits. But it at least includes the power to place reasonable limits on oral submissions, to direct that submissions be made in writing, to require an offer of proof before embarking on a lengthy voir dire, to defer rulings, to direct the manner in which a voir dire is conducted, especially whether to do so on the basis of testimony or in some other form, and exceptionally to direct the order in which evidence is called. The latter power is one that must be exercised sparingly because the trial judge does not know counsel’s brief. However, a judge would not commit jurisdictional error in exercising that power unless the effect of the ruling was to unfairly or irreparably damage the prosecution. That did not occur here. [para. 57]

[129]                     Rosenberg J.A. also found no error in the trial judge’s order directing the OSC to prepare and disclose a list of documents it intended to present to a witness. Again, this order was authorized by the trial judge’s trial management authority and the need to operate the trial efficiently.

[130]                     We endorse the approach taken in Felderhof. That decision correctly reflects the fact that trial management powers were never intended to intrude on the rules of evidence. The trial management powers identified in Felderhof allow trial judges to control the court’s process by managing how parties present their case, not the evidence they can tender to build their case. The trial judge’s decision to postpone ruling on the admissibility of documents until after the OSC called its next witness, for example, did not prevent the OSC from using those impugned documents to build its case; it simply deferred the admissibility issue to later in the trial and changed the order in which the OSC presented its case. Indeed, none of the trial management decisions in Felderhof impacted the substantive content of the OSC’s case.

[131]                     Before concluding, we wish to emphasize that this conclusion does not mean that trial management decisions are inconsequential and should be made haphazardly. How parties present their case may be just as important as the substance of their case. Accordingly, these powers should be exercised cautiously: Felderhof, at para. 38. Trial judges should generally confine themselves to their own responsibilities, leaving counsel and the jury to their respective functions: R. v. Murray, 2017 ONCA 393, 138 O.R. (3d) 500, at para. 39. If trial management decisions render a trial unfair, a new trial will be necessary, even when there are no conflicts with the rules of evidence: Felderhof, at paras. 38 and 56; Potter, at para. 787; Murray, at paras. 96 and 105; John, at paras. 50-51.

(2)         The Rules of Evidence Are Sensitive to Trial Efficiency Concerns

[132]                     The Crown argued that separating trial management powers from the rules of evidence in the way outlined above would lead to inefficiency and confusion. In its view, it is impossible to create “silos” between trial management powers and the rules of evidence, particularly in the context of cross-examination. The Crown submits that substantive limits on cross-examination can be justified on both evidentiary and trial management grounds because “[s]ome limitations will be based solely on evidentiary issues such as relevance” while others “will be based on efficiency to encourage focus”: R.R.F., at para. 3.

[133]                     We disagree. This argument is premised on the incorrect assumption that the law of evidence is blind to trial efficiency concerns. The law of evidence allows courts to weigh the benefits of admitting oral or real evidence against the costs to trial efficiency. Courts should exclude technically admissible evidence when the costs to the trial process outweigh the benefits. This is reflected in established exclusionary rules, as well as the general discretionary power to exclude evidence when its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effects.

[134]                     The collateral facts rule, for example, is an established exclusionary rule that prohibits calling evidence solely to contradict a witness on a collateral fact: R. v. C.F., 2017 ONCA 480, 349 C.C.C. (3d) 521, at para. 58. This rule is designed to promote judicial efficiency: D. M. Paciocco, P. Paciocco and L. Stuesser, The Law of Evidence (8th ed. 2020), at p. 4. In most cases, collateral facts are relevant and material, but not very probative of the ultimate issues at trial. Courts thus prevent parties from pursuing collateral facts because the benefit of pursuing the collateral facts to the trial’s truth-seeking function is outweighed by the negative effects to the trial process. But when the benefits of the collateral facts outweigh the negative impact on the trial process, exceptions to this general exclusionary rule apply. The established exceptions to the collateral facts rule — such as proof of bias — recognize that when the probative value of a collateral fact outweighs its prejudicial effects to trial efficiency, parties should be allowed to pursue the issue: p. 604.

[135]                     More generally, trial judges have a residual discretion to exclude technically admissible evidence when the evidence’s probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effects. Evidence is prejudicial when, among other concerns, it would unduly undermine the efficiency of the trial by consuming “an inordinate amount of time which is not commensurate with its value”: R. v. Mohan, 1994 CanLII 80 (SCC), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9, at p. 21; see also R. v. Handy, 2002 SCC 56, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908, at paras. 37 and 83; R. v. Candir, 2009 ONCA 915, 250 C.C.C. (3d) 139, at paras. 60-61; R. v. Hall, 2018 ONCA 185, 139 O.R. (3d) 561, at para. 59; R. v. Podolski, 2018 BCCA 96, 360 C.C.C. (3d) 1, at paras. 382-89.

[136]                     Contrary to the Crown’s position, limits on cross-examination can and should be understood as applications of these ordinary rules of evidence and, in particular, the trial judge’s residual power to exclude overly prejudicial evidence: R. v. Lyttle, 2004 SCC 5, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 193, at paras. 44 and 50; Nield, at para. 73. The Crown is correct that some courts have labelled a trial judge’s ability to curtail cross-examination as an instance of a trial judge’s trial management powers. For example, interventions to prevent irrelevant, repetitive, or misleading cross‑examination have been labelled by some courts as trial management decisions: see John, at para. 52; R. v. Polanco, 2018 ONCA 444, at para. 22 (CanLII); R. v. Evans, 2019 ONCA 715, 147 O.R. (3d) 577, at para. 104.

[137]                     But we disagree with these cases and would overturn them on this point. It is more appropriate to label such interventions as evidentiary rulings. A trial judge should prevent counsel from asking irrelevant questions because those questions have no probative value. Similarly, courts should stop repetitious or misleading questioning because the probative value of repeated or misleading questions is minimal while their prejudicial effects to the trial process are significant: see R. v. Mitchell, 2008 ONCA 757, at paras. 7 and 19 (CanLII); Candir, at paras. 60‑63; Podolski, at paras. 382-89.

[138]                     In sum, when considering the admissibility of real or oral evidence, trial judges can and should consider trial efficiency concerns. There is no need to rely on trial management authority when weighing the benefits of evidence against the need for trial expediency.

[139]                     But there are significant risks with relying on trial management authority when making evidentiary rulings. We focus on two below, namely the risks to (1) trial predictability and consistency, and (2) the accused’s right to make full answer and defence.

(a)           The Rules of Evidence Promote Predictability and Consistency

[140]                     Most litigation is a truth-seeking exercise. Cases typically turn on a dispute about the facts, not on disagreements about what the law requires. As such, the rules governing how parties can establish the facts to support their case are often just as important as the substantive legal principles governing the dispute.

[141]                     The rules of evidence dictate how parties can establish the facts needed to build their case. In a predictable manner, it lets parties know what information they can present to support their case, how they can tender this information, and what use they can make of this information once admitted: see R. v. Youvarajah, 2013 SCC 41, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 720, at para. 25.

[142]                     Parties are entitled to present all relevant and material evidence to the trier of fact, absent a clear ground for exclusion: R. v. Jarvis, 2002 SCC 73, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 757, at para. 68; C. A. Wright, “The Law of Evidence: Present and Future” (1942), 20 Can. Bar Rev. 714, at p. 715; S. N. Lederman, A. W. Bryant and M. K. Fuerst, Sopinka, Lederman & Bryant: The Law of Evidence in Canada (5th ed. 2018), at §1.1. A decision that restricts the trier of fact from considering relevant and material evidence in the absence of a clear ground of policy or law justifying exclusion jeopardizes the accused’s constitutional right to make full answer and defence. It also undercuts society’s interest in getting at the truth: R. v. Seaboyer, 1991 CanLII 76 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at p. 609; R. v. Khelawon, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, at paras. 47-48.

[143]                     When the admissibility of oral or real evidence is at issue, trial judges should turn their minds to the rules of evidence, not their trial management authority. Relying on trial management authority to make evidentiary determinations could create a two-tiered system: some litigants would need to build their case under established evidentiary rules while others would need to build it under the trial judge’s more loosely defined and opaque trial management discretion. This would make litigation less predictable, accessible, and fair. It would also stifle development of the law. If appropriate rulings cannot be made under the current rules of evidence, those rules should be modified, not ignored.

(b)         The Rules of Evidence Protect an Accused Person’s Right to Make Full Answer and Defence

[144]                     The rules of evidence provide special protection to accused persons. Accused persons have a wide right to call evidence: R. v. Clarke (1998), 1998 CanLII 14604 (ON CA), 18 C.R. (5th) 219 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 231. Unlike in the case of Crown‑led evidence, there is no evidentiary discretion to exclude technically admissible defence evidence simply because its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effects. Instead, defence‑led evidence should be excluded only when its probative value is substantially outweighed by the prejudice it could cause: Seaboyer, at pp. 611-12; R. v. Shearing, 2002 SCC 58, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 33, at para. 76. This more demanding standard for the exclusion of defence‑led evidence is founded in the fundamental tenet of our justice system that it is generally better to produce an inaccurate acquittal than a wrongful conviction.

[145]                     An accused person’s wide right to call evidence includes a wide right to cross-examine the Crown’s witnesses, especially when credibility is the central issue at trial: Lyttle, at paras. 69-70; R. v. Osolin, 1993 CanLII 54 (SCC), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at pp. 663‑65. A trial judge should only intervene in a defence‑led cross-examination when the prejudice from the accused’s questioning substantially outweighs the value of the evidence: Nield, at para. 73.

[146]                     If a trial judge curtails defence‑led evidence under the guise of their trial management powers, these safeguards may be ignored. The rules of evidence outlined above protect an accused’s right to make full answer and defence by ensuring that trial judges do not too readily exclude defence evidence, even when that evidence has minimal probative value or some serious prejudicial effects. Trial management powers do not direct trial judges to be similarly cautious. Relying on trial management authority to curtail a line of cross-examination in the name of trial efficiency, for example, could prevent defence counsel from eliciting relevant and material evidence even when the prejudicial effects of the questions do not substantially outweigh their probative value.

[147]                     This would jeopardize the accused’s right to make full answer and defence and increase the chance for wrongful convictions. But this risk can be minimized by ensuring that judges consistently turn their minds to the rules of evidence when asked to determine the admissibility of real or oral evidence, rather than their trial management authority.

[148]                     Given the trial judge’s proximity to the evidence and awareness of the dynamics at trial, the trial judge’s considered weighing of probative value and prejudicial effect is entitled to deference on appeal: R. v. Araya, 2015 SCC 11, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 581, at para. 31. However, whether the trial judge applied the proper legal test to decide an evidentiary issue is reviewable on a standard of correctness: S. C. Hill, D. M. Tanovich and L. P. Strezos, McWilliams’ Canadian Criminal Evidence (5th ed. (loose-leaf)), vol. 3, at §37:31; Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 8; R. v. Duong, 2007 ONCA 68, 84 O.R. (3d) 515, at para. 54; R. v. C. (K.), 2015 ONCA 39, 17 C.R. (7th) 181, at para. 36.

(3)         The Exclusion of Evidence Relating to Who Had Possession of the Gun Was an Erroneous Evidentiary Ruling

[149]                     The majority of the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge’s exclusion of the security guard’s preliminary inquiry testimony about who dropped and picked up the gun was a proper exercise of the trial judge’s trial management powers and entitled to deference. This was an error. By preventing Mr. Samaniego’s counsel from cross‑examining the security guard on his inconsistent testimony, the trial judge excluded prima facie relevant, material, and otherwise admissible evidence. This was an evidentiary decision and its propriety must be assessed through the law of evidence. As we explain below, this error is sufficient to warrant a new trial. It is therefore unnecessary to comment further on the other three impugned rulings.

[150]                     We do not dispute that the initial question posed by Mr. Samaniego’s counsel was poorly phrased. After reading out the relevant portion of the preliminary inquiry transcript, Mr. Samaniego’s counsel asked the security guard: “. . . why did you not tell what you’re telling us today or yesterday?” As the majority of the Court of Appeal points out, the trial judge saw this as a potentially misleading question, since the security guard ultimately adopted his police statement at the preliminary inquiry.

[151]                     The law of evidence provided the trial judge with a number of options to deal with this arguably misleading question. If she thought the question was misleading because it was missing necessary context, she could have asked Mr. Samaniego’s counsel to rephrase the question and draw the security guard’s attention to the fact that he had also subsequently adopted his police statement at the preliminary inquiry: Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5, s. 10(1); Lederman, Bryant and Fuerst, at §16.186. The trial judge could have also simply allowed the question, leaving it for the Crown to raise the security guard’s prior consistent police statement in reply: see Hill, Tanovich and Strezos, vol. 2, at §21:91; Murray, at paras. 152-54. Either way, the jury could then assess whether the inconsistency was the result of the security guard’s genuine memory loss or whether it was illustrative of the security guard testifying falsely at the preliminary inquiry to protect his friend.

[152]                     Alternatively, if the trial judge thought that defence counsel was baselessly misrepresenting the facts and misleading the jury, she could have restricted that line of questioning under her overarching exclusionary power if the question’s probative value was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effects. Contrary to our colleague’s assertion, this would be an evidentiary ruling, not a trial management decision.

[153]                     The trial judge took none of these steps. She did not determine that the question’s probative value was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effects, nor was there any basis for doing so. Instead, she thought the question was misleading because it was missing some necessary context: the fact that the security guard made a consistent statement in his police statement. But instead of following the correct evidentiary procedures noted above to deal with this, the trial judge prevented Mr. Samaniego’s counsel from asking any questions on the specifics about what the security guard said at the preliminary inquiry before he adopted his police statement. The trial judge then instructed the jury that any reference to the security guard’s preliminary inquiry testimony related to his uncertainty about who he saw holding the gun was to be disregarded and play no basis in their deliberations.

[154]                     This was not a trial management decision. It did not impact how Mr. Samaniego could present his case; it directly impacted the substance of Mr. Samaniego’s defence and his ability to build his defence. It prevented Mr. Samaniego’s counsel from adducing oral evidence — that is, testimony from the security guard at trial — that could have undermined the security guard’s credibility. It was therefore an evidentiary decision. Its propriety must be assessed through the law of evidence.

[155]                     There was no sound evidentiary basis justifying the exclusion of this evidence. This evidence was relevant and material. The security guard’s initial preliminary inquiry testimony was plainly inconsistent with his trial testimony, as the trial judge herself acknowledged. It was therefore relevant and material to a central issue at trial — the security guard’s credibility. To reiterate, the security guard’s testimony was the only evidence at trial that linked Mr. Samaniego to the gun. Establishing that the security guard gave inconsistent testimony on the direct issue underlying the charge — who had possession of the gun — could have been highly damaging to the security guard’s credibility. It could have also supported Mr. Samaniego’s central defence at trial: that the security guard was biased and willing to give misleading testimony to assist his friend, Mr. Serrano.

[156]                     The impugned evidence was also not subject to any exclusionary rule. The fact that the security guard’s police statement was admitted through a hearsay exception at the preliminary inquiry did not erase the earlier inconsistent testimony. The trial judge seems to have misunderstood the effect of the preliminary inquiry ruling. The preliminary inquiry ruling did not bind the trial judge: R. v. Hynes, 2001 SCC 82, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 623, at para. 48; R. E. Salhany, Canadian Criminal Procedure (6th ed. (loose-leaf)), vol. 1, at §5:5. Nor did it erase the evidence. As Paciocco J.A. correctly points out in dissent, “[l]ater evidence does not eradicate earlier evidence”: para. 125. The trial judge erred in holding otherwise.

[157]                     Finally, the prejudicial effects of the evidence did not substantially outweigh its probative value: Seaboyer, at pp. 611-12. As noted above, the probative value of this evidence was extremely high and touched on the central issue at trial. The prejudicial effects, on the other hand, were minimal at best. Indeed, neither the trial judge nor the Crown purported to rely on this basis for the exclusion, as there were clearly no grounds for doing so.

[158]                     This erroneous evidentiary decision deprived Mr. Samaniego of the right to pursue a highly relevant line of cross-examination. It also usurped the role of the jury. The trial judge may have viewed the inconsistent testimony as an instance of genuine memory loss. But that was not her call to make. The jury, not the trial judge, was entitled to determine whether the inconsistency was the result of genuine memory loss or an instance of the security guard testifying falsely to protect his friend.

C.            Issue 3: The Curative Proviso Cannot Save This Error

[159]                     Section 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code, known as the curative proviso, permits an appellate court to dismiss an appeal, despite an error of law, when there is “no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice”.

[160]                     At the Court of Appeal, the Crown did not raise the application of the curative proviso. The Crown also did not raise the application of the curative proviso in its factum before this Court. It was only in response to a question during oral argument in this Court that the Crown submitted that the curative proviso could be applied if a legal error is found. While we agree that this issue is properly before this Court, in our view, the curative proviso is clearly inapplicable.

[161]                     The jurisprudence on the application of the curative proviso is clear. The curative proviso can only be applied where there is no “reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been different had the error . . . not been made”: R. v. Bevan, 1993 CanLII 101 (SCC), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599, at p. 617. There are two situations in which the curative proviso is appropriate: (1) where the error is so harmless or trivial that it could not have had any impact on the verdict; or (2) where the evidence is so overwhelming that the trier of fact would have inevitably convicted (R. v. Khan, 2001 SCC 86, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 823, at paras. 29-31).

[162]                     Regardless of which branch of the curative proviso is argued, the Crown bears the burden of showing its application is appropriate: R. v. Van, 2009 SCC 22, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 716, at para. 34. This is a heavy burden, reflecting the limited role of an appellate court and the need to safeguard the criminal justice process from the risk of wrongful convictions: see R. v. Trochym, 2007 SCC 6, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 239, at para. 82; R. v. Sarrazin, 2011 SCC 54, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 505, at para. 28; R. v. R.V., 2019 SCC 41, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 237, at paras. 110 and 127, per Brown and Rowe JJ., dissenting. Where the error of law is the exclusion of exculpatory evidence, any reasonable effect that the excluded evidence could have had on the trier of fact should enure to the benefit of the accused: Wildman v. The Queen, 1984 CanLII 82 (SCC), [1984] 2 S.C.R. 311, at p. 329.

[163]                     The first branch of the curative proviso has appropriately been applied in cases where it is possible to trace the effect of the error on the verdict. Generally, an error may be characterized as harmless if it is insignificant to the determination of guilt or if it benefits the accused: Khan, at para. 30. As this Court stated in Van, “[t]he overriding question is whether the error on its face or in its effect was so minor, so irrelevant to the ultimate issue in the trial, or so clearly non-prejudicial, that any reasonable judge or jury could not possibly have rendered a different verdict if the error had not been made”: para. 35.

[164]                     The second branch of the curative proviso can be appropriately applied when the Crown can demonstrate that the evidence was so overwhelming such that, despite the error, a trier of fact would have inevitably convicted: Khan, at para. 31. Under the second branch, “[t]he standard applied by an appellate court, namely that the evidence against an accused is so overwhelming that conviction is inevitable or would invariably result, is a substantially higher one than the requirement that the Crown prove its case ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ at trial”: Trochym, at para. 82.

[165]                     The two branches of the curative proviso are distinct. The assessment of whether an error is harmless is done without reference to the strength of other evidence at trial: Van, at para. 35. In Sarrazin, this Court explicitly rejected the argument that an error could be characterized as harmless if the Crown could show that, although the error was prejudicial to the accused, it was highly unlikely to have affected the result. Sarrazin has not been overruled and the comments of Binnie J. remain apposite:

It seems to me that there is a significant difference between an error of law that can be confidently dismissed as “harmless”, and an assessment that while the error is prejudicial, it is not (in the after-the-fact view of the appellate court) so prejudicial as to have affected the outcome. Such delicate assessments are foreign to the purpose of the curative proviso which is to avoid a retrial that would be superfluous and unnecessary but to set high the Crown’s burden of establishing those prerequisites. The same can be said for the other branch of the curative proviso. As a result, the burden of the Crown to demonstrate an “overwhelming” case or a “harmless” error of law should not be relaxed. [Emphasis in original; para. 28.]

[166]                     Neither branch of the proviso is applicable here. With respect to the first branch, the error was not harmless. The right to cross-examine a Crown witness without significant and unwarranted constraint is an essential element of the right to make full answer and defence, guaranteed by both the common law and the Charter under ss. 7 and 11(d): Lyttle, at paras. 2 and 41; Osolin, at pp. 663‑65; Seaboyer, at p. 608; R. v. Levogiannis, 1993 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 475; R. v. N.S., 2012 SCC 72, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 726, at para. 24. Commensurate with its importance, the right of cross-examination must be jealously protected and broadly construed: Lyttle, at paras. 43-44.

[167]                     In this case, the trial judge’s interference with defence counsel’s cross‑examination was both significant and unwarranted. Without any evidentiary basis on which to limit the scope of the cross-examination, the trial judge precluded Mr. Samaniego’s counsel from probing the security guard on the inconsistency between his preliminary inquiry testimony and his testimony at trial. While the trial judge permitted Mr. Samaniego’s counsel to ask the security guard about his “memory in general terms”, that was not enough: R.R., vol. III, at p. 62. Mr. Samaniego’s counsel was entitled to explore the specifics of this particular inconsistency. Counsel was also entitled to use this inconsistency as part of her overall challenge to the security guard’s credibility. An effective cross-examination often involves a coordinated series of attacks that, cumulatively, undermine the witness’s credibility. The right to make full answer and defence therefore entitles an accused to explore all inconsistencies and lines of credibility attack, within the evidentiary limits outlined above.

[168]                     The significance of this error was compounded by the fact that the inconsistency went to the heart of the indictment: who had possession of the gun. It is important to again stress that the only evidence at trial that linked Mr. Samaniego to possession of the gun was the testimony of the security guard. Although there is no absolute bar against applying the curative proviso to cases turning primarily on credibility, the Crown’s burden is especially high in those cases. An appellate court must exercise extra caution before applying the curative proviso in such circumstances: R. v. Perkins, 2016 ONCA 588, 352 O.A.C. 149, at para. 32; R. v. Raghunauth (2005), 2005 CanLII 37253 (ON CA), 203 O.A.C. 54, at para. 9; R. v. L.K.W. (1999), 1999 CanLII 3791 (ON CA), 126 O.A.C. 39, at para. 97.

[169]                     In Lyttle, this Court held that unwarranted interference with an accused’s cross-examination of a principal Crown witness could not be classified as a harmless error when the credibility of the Crown witness was a central issue at trial. At paras. 69‑70, Major and Fish JJ. approvingly quoted two court of appeal decisions that underscored why the curative proviso was inapplicable in the circumstances. This passage remains applicable to the circumstances in this appeal:

In R. v. Anandmalik (1984), 6 O.A.C. 143, at p. 144, the Ontario Court of Appeal recognized that the importance of cross-examination becomes even more critical when credibility is the central issue in the trial:

 

In a case where the guilt or innocence of the [accused] largely turned on credibility, it was a serious error to limit the [accused] of his substantial right to fully cross-examine the principal Crown witness. It would not be appropriate in the circumstances to invoke or apply the curative provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) [now s. 686(1)(b)(iii)].

 

The Manitoba Court of Appeal echoed these sentiments in R. v. Wallick (1990), 1990 CanLII 11128 (MB CA), 69 Man. R. (2d) 310, at p. 311:

 

Cross-examination is a most powerful weapon of the defence, particularly when the entire case turns on credibility of the witnesses. An accused in a criminal case has the right of cross-examination in the fullest and widest sense of the word as long as he does not abuse that right. Any improper interference with the right is an error which will result in the conviction being quashed. [Text in brackets in original.]

[170]                     Our colleague suggests that this Court’s application of the curative proviso in R.V. justifies its application here. We disagree. While R.V. demonstrates that there is no categorical rule preventing the application of the proviso when a trial judge erroneously interferes with cross-examination, R.V. also stresses that “[b]ecause it is difficult to predict what lines of questioning counsel might pursue and what evidence may have emerged had cross-examination been permitted, a failure to allow relevant cross-examination will almost always be grounds for a new trial”: para. 86 (emphasis added). Our colleague’s approach effectively reads this direction out of R.V. The use of the proviso in R.V. should be seen as extraordinary and only justified on the unique facts of that case. In particular, three features distinguish it from this one.

[171]                     First, in R.V., the proposed cross-examination was highly constrained by s. 276 of the Criminal Code because it explored the complainant’s sexual history. This line of cross-examination therefore would have been “tightly controlled” in any event: para. 88. The same was not true for Mr. Samaniego’s cross-examination. He was entitled to fully explore the security guard’s prior inconsistent statement about who dropped and picked up the gun without constraint.

[172]                     Second, while R.V. was improperly constrained in his cross-examination, he was ultimately allowed to explore all the substantive points he wanted to pursue on cross-examination. The majority therefore concluded that “the scope of permissible cross-examination would not have been any broader than the questioning that actually occurred”: para. 96 (emphasis added). At this Court, “counsel for R.V. candidly admitted that nothing prevented the defence from further probing the complainant’s testimony about when she began seeing her boyfriend or her motive to lie”: para. 98 (emphasis added). Mr. Samaniego, on the other hand, was denied altogether any opportunity to probe the inconsistency in the security guard’s testimony. The trial judge also ensured that the only question Mr. Samaniego’s counsel asked played no role in the jury’s deliberation by instructing the jury to “completely disregar[d]” the testimonial inconsistency.

[173]                     Third, the proposed cross-examination in R.V. had less probative value than Mr. Samaniego’s. In R.V., the cross-examination was only intended to show that the complainant was lying about the sexual assault to cover up an unexpected pregnancy with her boyfriend (or another partner). If the trier of fact rejected that defence theory, the cross-examination had no further value. In this case, however, the cross‑examination’s relevancy was twofold. It supported the main defence theory (that the security guard was willing to lie to protect Mr. Serrano) and it independently undermined the security guard’s credibility by providing a clear example of prior inconsistent testimony. Accordingly, unlike in R.V., Mr. Samaniego’s cross‑examination had relevancy even if the trier of fact rejected the defence’s theory of the case, as the jury could have used this inconsistency to conclude that the security guard was an unreliable witness.

[174]                     R.V. is therefore distinguishable. If the trier of fact had any reasonable doubt about the veracity of the security guard’s testimony that Mr. Samaniego was at some point in possession of the gun, Mr. Samaniego was entitled to an acquittal. Any inconsistency in the security guard’s testimony was therefore highly relevant to the trial. An inconsistency going to who had the gun, however, was the most important type of testimonial inconsistency that defence counsel could hope to explore. This is especially so given the facts of this case, as the security guard’s initial unwillingness to incriminate his friend at the preliminary inquiry until he was confronted with a contradictory police statement buttressed Mr. Samaniego’s central defence theory.

[175]                     Contrary to our colleague’s assertions, the security guard’s account of who dropped and picked up the gun did not serve to incriminate Mr. Serrano at “every step of the way”: majority reasons, at para. 73. Despite being “good friends” with Mr. Serrano for 10 years, the security guard did not identify Mr. Serrano by name in the police statement, instead referring to him only as the “second guy with [the] baseball hat”: R.R., vol. I, at p. 3. This vague description of Mr. Serrano continued throughout the preliminary inquiry. Further, after the police statement was admitted and identity was conceded, the security guard’s testimony consistently painted Mr. Serrano in a favourable light. At trial, the security guard testified that Mr. Serrano was a friend who de‑escalated a dangerous situation caused by Mr. Samaniego bringing the gun to the nightclub. For example, the security guard agreed with Mr. Serrano’s counsel that before he picked up the gun, Mr. Serrano looked at him in a non-aggressive and non-intimidating way, conveying to him that everything was going to be okay. We therefore cannot agree with the assertion that the trial judge’s error was insignificant because the security guard was plainly willing to incriminate Mr. Serrano at every step.

[176]                     Although the majority at the Court of Appeal did not discuss the potential application of the curative proviso, they held that, even if the trial judge did err in restricting cross-examination on the security guard’s preliminary inquiry testimony about who dropped and picked up the gun, the trial was not rendered unfair. The majority at the Court of Appeal emphasized that there was no unfairness because (1) Mr. Samaniego’s counsel framed her questions as going to memory and the refusal of the security guard to identify who dropped the gun, (2) the trial judge was concerned about the suggestion that the security guard’s testimony at the preliminary inquiry did not include the police statement, and (3) Mr. Samaniego’s counsel fully explored various inconsistencies in the security guard’s evidence and the suggestion that his testimony was tailored to benefit the co-accused. With respect, none of these factors, on their own or in combination, would justify the application of the curative proviso in these circumstances.

[177]                     First, as Paciocco J.A. correctly highlighted in dissent, it is clear that Mr. Samaniego’s counsel was challenging the credibility of the security guard. This is evident from the defence’s theory of the case — the security guard was lying to protect his friend. It is also evident from the initial question that drew the objection, in which Mr. Samaniego’s counsel asked the security guard: “. . . why did you not tell what you’re telling us today or yesterday?” Finally, it is evident from counsel’s response to the trial judge’s questions, where she explained that the question was relevant because it showed that the security guard “refused to identify the — who the person who dropped the gun but now he’s able to recall directly”. Mr. Samaniego’s counsel only framed her challenge in terms of memory after the trial judge ruled that “[t]he decision was made at the preliminary inquiry that he couldn’t remember. . . . [Y]ou can’t go back to what preceded this voir dire ruling”: R.R., vol. III, at pp. 60‑61. Accordingly, this error cannot be characterized as harmless due to the way defence counsel framed the question. The prior inconsistent testimony was clearly being proffered to undermine the credibility of the security guard.

[178]                     Second, as explained above, the trial judge’s concern that the initial question to the security guard was unfair did not justify or mitigate the significant curtailment of Mr. Samaniego’s cross-examination of the key Crown witness. The trial judge had a number of options to deal with what she viewed as a potentially misleading question, none of which required preventing defence counsel from entirely pursuing this line of questioning.

[179]                     Third, the notion that this error was harmless because Mr. Samaniego was able to effectively put his theory of the case to the jury fundamentally misunderstands and degrades the constitutionally protected right to make full answer and defence. The right to full answer and defence entails more than simply the right to put one’s position before the jury — it entails the right to marshal all relevant and material evidence not subject to an exclusionary rule and whose probative value is not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect. In Seaboyer, McLachlin J. explained: “The right of the innocent not to be convicted is dependent on the right to present full answer and defence. This, in turn, depends on being able to call the evidence necessary to establish a defence and to challenge the evidence called by the prosecution” (p. 608 (emphasis added)).

[180]                     The unfairness flowing from the trial judge’s erroneous ruling was also not minimized by the fact that Mr. Samaniego could explore other inconsistencies in the security guard’s testimony and generally allude to the security guard’s motive to lie. As Paciocco J.A. noted, “[t]here is a world of difference between establishing a relationship that could bias a witness and presenting evidence capable of satisfying jurors that the witness may have given biased testimony in the same proceedings in favour of his friend”: para. 99.

[181]                     Finally, the potential impact of the trial judge’s error was compounded by her mid-trial charge to the jury, which was repeated in the final charge to the jury. The trial judge instructed the jury that “any reference” to the alleged inconsistency must be “completely disregarded” and “must have no part in your consideration or deliberation about this case”. Accordingly, not only did the trial judge unduly preclude defence counsel from cross-examining the security guard on the prior inconsistent statement, her charge also negated any potential impact that the earlier cross-examination on this issue could have had in undermining the security guard’s credibility.

[182]                     In sum, the trial judge’s error cannot be characterized as harmless. Our colleague emphasizes that our reasons focus only on one issue. Indeed, we do not believe it is necessary to address the other impugned rulings in light of the seriousness and central importance to trial fairness of the legal error that we have highlighted.

[183]                     In our view, our colleague’s reliance on R.V. is misguided. It warrants repetition that cross-examination is central to the truth-seeking function, which is why this Court stressed in R.V. that “a failure to allow relevant cross-examination will almost always be grounds for a new trial”. Given this general rule, the application of the curative proviso in R.V. must be seen as extraordinary and only justified on the unique circumstances of that case. To the extent that the curative proviso can be applied more generally where cross-examination has been curtailed contrary to the rules of evidence, this is a matter of considerable concern. While the right to cross-examination is not unlimited, any such limitations should be confined to carefully defined circumstances where there is a sufficient countervailing consideration to justify the limitation. Only in rare and exceptional circumstances can unwarranted interference with cross-examination be appropriately categorized as a harmless error. In the circumstances of this case, the error cannot be said to be harmless.

[184]                     Similarly, the trial judge’s error cannot be justified under the second branch of the curative proviso. The evidence was far from overwhelming — the only evidence linking Mr. Samaniego to possession of the gun was the testimony of one witness who had a motive to lie and whose testimony at trial about who he saw drop the gun was, at times, manifestly inconsistent with his testimony at the preliminary inquiry. In light of the foregoing, the application of the curative proviso is inappropriate in the circumstances of this case.

VII.      Conclusion

[185]                     For the foregoing reasons, we would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction, and order a new trial.

                    English version of the judgment of the Court delivered by

                    The Chief Justice —

[1]                             This appeal gives the Court an opportunity to clarify the scope of judicial discretion when determining the amount of a fine to impose on an offender under s. 462.37(3) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 (“Cr. C.”), in lieu of an order for forfeiture of property that is proceeds of crime (“fine in lieu”). In particular, this Court must determine whether a court has the discretion to limit the amount of a fine in lieu to the profit made by an offender from their criminal activities and must delineate the circumstances in which a court may apportion between co‑accused the value of property that is proceeds of crime. This appeal serves, incidentally, as an occasion for this Court to reaffirm that a fine in lieu is ordered as a substitute for forfeiture and not as a punishment for the commission of an offence, although the fine is part of the sentencing process.

[2]                             The backdrop to this case is a large‑scale theft and fraud scheme targeting maple syrup, a scheme in which the respondent, Richard Vallières, was one of the major players. At trial, Mr. Vallières was convicted of fraud, trafficking and theft in respect of maple syrup belonging to the Fédération des producteurs acéricoles du Québec (“Federation”). The Crown’s appeal is limited to the fine in lieu imposed on Mr. Vallières at sentencing. The trial judge imposed a fine in lieu corresponding to the resale value of the maple syrup obtained by theft or fraud, but the Quebec Court of Appeal reduced that amount to the profit made by Mr. Vallières. In both cases, the amount of a restitution order was subtracted from the fine. For the reasons that follow, I am of the view that the Court of Appeal erred.

I.               Background

[3]                             In June 2011, Mr. Vallières met his principal accomplice, Avik Caron. Together, they planned to steal maple syrup from one of the Federation’s warehouses and resell it on the black market.

[4]                             Essentially, Mr. Caron was in charge of the maple syrup theft operations at the Federation’s warehouse in the municipality of Saint‑Louis‑de‑Blandford. Mr. Caron and his accomplices surreptitiously took barrels of maple syrup, emptied them and filled them with water. The maple syrup thereby stolen from the Federation was then transferred to other barrels or plastic containers, which were transported in 53‑foot tractor‑trailers. The transport operations were overseen by another accomplice, Sébastien Jutras. Mr. Vallières purchased the syrup directly from Mr. Caron and exported it outside Quebec, including to New Brunswick, where his co‑accused Étienne St‑Pierre carried on business.

[5]                             The stolen maple syrup therefore passed through the hands of several individuals before it was resold by Mr. Vallières, who collected the income and paid his various accomplices. In this regard, 6 of his 16 accomplices were ordered to pay fines in lieu, in amounts ranging from $9,840 to $1,200,000.

[6]                             This criminal enterprise, which spanned a period of about a year, led to the largest deployment of resources in the history of the Sûreté du Québec for an investigation concerning stolen tangible property. That massive police operation uncovered a theft of 9,571 barrels of maple syrup belonging to the Federation with a market value of over $18,000,000.

[7]                             In addition to trafficking in the stolen syrup, Mr. Vallières purchased maple syrup in fraud of the Federation’s rights by going directly through Quebec maple syrup producers without being an authorized buyer or paying the contribution provided for in the provincial syrup marketing regulations.

[8]                             By Mr. Vallières’s own admission, he earned $10,000,000 in income from the resale of the syrup obtained by theft or fraud and made a personal profit of nearly $1,000,000, minus certain transportation costs.

II.            Procedural History

A.           Quebec Superior Court, 2017 QCCS 1687 (Pronovost J.)

[9]                             In 2016, a jury found Mr. Vallières guilty of theft, fraud and trafficking in property obtained by crime, offences that all concerned property with a value of more than $5,000. At the sentencing stage, the Crown sought, among other things, a fine in lieu of $9,393,498.44 payable within 8 years.

[10]                        The trial judge began by considering whether it was appropriate to impose such a fine on Mr. Vallières. Finding that Mr. Vallières had profited from the crimes he had committed with other individuals, which had taken place over a lengthy period of time, the trial judge concluded that a fine in lieu therefore had to be imposed on him. Although the evidence established that the Federation had incurred a financial loss exceeding $18,000,000, the judge, relying on the admission made by Mr. Vallières, determined that he had had in his possession at least $10,000,000 from the resale of the syrup obtained by theft or fraud.

[11]                        The judge noted that his discretion to determine the amount of the fine in lieu was limited: the fine had to be equal to the value of the property that was proceeds of crime and that had been in Mr. Vallières’s possession or under his control. Because the evidence showed beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Vallières had received $10,000,000 from the theft, fraud and trafficking he had committed, the judge found that he had no choice but to order the payment of that amount as a fine in lieu. From the $10,000,000, he subtracted $606,501.56, which was the amount of a restitution order.[1] Mr. Vallières was subject to a 6‑year term of imprisonment if he failed to pay the fine in lieu within 10 years.

B.            Quebec Court of Appeal, 2020 QCCA 372 (Hilton, Bouchard and Beaupré JJ.A.)

[12]                        On appeal, Mr. Vallières essentially argued that the trial judge had exercised his discretion improperly by ordering him to pay a fine in lieu, the terms and amount of which were not challenged.

[13]                        The Court of Appeal rejected that argument and upheld the trial judge’s imposition of a fine in lieu. In its view, the syrup sold by Mr. Vallières during the offence period had been obtained either by theft from the Federation or in fraud of its rights, designated offences of which he had been convicted. All of the income generated by Mr. Vallières during that period — $10,000,000, which he admitted — was therefore proceeds of crime.

[14]                        Despite that finding, and without requesting further arguments from the parties, the Court of Appeal continued its analysis and intervened on its own initiative to reduce the amount of the fine in lieu.

[15]                        Based on its interpretation of R. v. Dieckmann, 2017 ONCA 575, 355 C.C.C. (3d) 216, the Court of Appeal held that courts have the discretion to impose a fine that reflects the profit made by an offender from criminal activity, provided that this penalty meets the dual objective of deprivation of proceeds and deterrence. The trial judge had therefore erred in finding that he had no choice but to impose a fine in lieu of $10,000,000, minus the amount of the restitution order.

[16]                        The Court of Appeal further noted that the imposition of that fine created a clear situation of double recovery in light of the fines imposed on Mr. Vallières’s accomplices, which were also related to profits derived from his resale of the syrup.

[17]                        In the Court of Appeal’s view, the $10,000,000 fine in lieu imposed in this case was clearly disproportionate to the objectives of the scheme governing this type of fine. Imposing a fine that reflected Mr. Vallières’s profit margin of $1,000,000 was more in keeping with the objective of deprivation of proceeds and with the maxim that “crime does not pay”.

[18]                        The Court of Appeal accordingly allowed the appeal on this ground and reduced the fine in lieu to $1,000,000, minus the amount of the restitution order ($828,602.43 in Canadian currency), resulting in a total fine in lieu of $171,397.57. It also reduced the term of imprisonment in default of payment of the fine from six to three years.

III.         Issues

[19]                        The issues raised by this appeal are as follows:

1.      Did the Quebec Court of Appeal err in reducing the amount of the fine in lieu imposed on Mr. Vallières?

2.      Did the Court of Appeal err in failing to allow the parties to be heard regarding the change to the amount of the fine in lieu, given that this question had not been raised on appeal?

[20]                        The analysis of the first issue is sufficient to decide this appeal. I will therefore deal only very briefly with the second issue concerning the Crown’s right to be heard on a question that had not been argued in the Court of Appeal.

IV.         Parties’ Arguments

[21]                        The Crown submits that the Court of Appeal could not reduce the amount of the fine in lieu so that it corresponded to the profit made by Mr. Vallières from his criminal activities. According to the Crown, the amount of the fine had to be equal to the value of the property that was proceeds of crime, that is, the sum of $10,000,000 derived from the resale of the syrup obtained by theft or fraud. The Crown contends incidentally that the Court of Appeal erred in modifying the amount of the fine in lieu without giving the parties an opportunity to argue this question, which had not been raised by Mr. Vallières on appeal.

[22]                        Mr. Vallières argues that the Court of Appeal was justified in intervening because the trial judge had erred in exercising his discretion by stating that he had no choice but to impose a fine in lieu of $10,000,000, minus the amount of the restitution order. Mr. Vallières adds that the Court of Appeal had no obligation to give the parties an opportunity to make submissions concerning the amount of the fine, since this point necessarily arose from the issues submitted by the parties. He further argues that the Court of Appeal had the requisite factual background to decide this question.

V.           Analysis

A.           Did the Quebec Court of Appeal Err in Reducing the Amount of the Fine in Lieu Imposed on Mr. Vallières?

[23]                        Answering this question first requires determining whether courts have the discretion to limit the amount of a fine in lieu to the profit made from a criminal activity where this penalty meets the dual objective of deprivation of proceeds and deterrence. This appeal also provides an opportunity to clarify the circumstances in which courts may apportion the value of property that is proceeds of crime between co‑accused who had possession or control of that same property or of part of it.

(1)         Nature of a Fine in Lieu

[24]                        Before beginning my analysis, I should emphasize the special nature of a fine in lieu as a separate component of sentencing. Although a fine in lieu is technically part of a sentence pursuant to s. 673 Cr. C., such an order differs from the sentence imposed for the commission of a designated offence in that its purpose is to replace the proceeds of crime rather than to punish the offender (R. v. Lavigne, 2006 SCC 10, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 392, at para. 25). A fine in lieu is therefore, first and foremost, in the nature of a forfeiture order. It has consistently been held that the forfeiture inquiry is independent of the broader inquiry undertaken with respect to sentencing and the principles related thereto (Lavigne, at paras. 25‑26; R. v. Craig, 2009 SCC 23, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 762, at paras. 34‑37; R. v. Ouellette, 2009 SCC 24, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 818, at para. 2; R. v. Nguyen, 2009 SCC 25, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 826, at para. 2). It is therefore imperative that, when calculating the amount of a fine in lieu, courts put aside the general principles of sentencing that are incompatible with the nature of this order.

(2)         Discretion to Limit the Amount of a Fine in Lieu to the Profit Made From a Criminal Activity

[25]                        In order to clearly understand the nature of a fine in lieu, it is important to situate it in the more general context of Part XII.2 of the Criminal Code, entitled “Proceeds of Crime”. This term is defined broadly (R. v. Dwyer, 2013 ONCA 34, 296 C.C.C. (3d) 193, at para. 21). It means “any property, benefit or advantage . . . obtained or derived directly or indirectly as a result of . . . the commission . . . of a designated offence” (s. 462.3(1) Cr. C.). A “designated offence” is “any offence that may be prosecuted as an indictable offence under [the Criminal Code] or any other Act of Parliament, other than an indictable offence prescribed by regulation” (s. 462.3(1) Cr. C.). In this case, the designated offences of which Mr. Vallières was convicted are theft, fraud and trafficking in property obtained by crime, all of which concerned property with a value of more than $5,000.

[26]                        The imposition of a fine in lieu may be considered where forfeiture of the property that is proceeds of crime has become impracticable. In such a case, a court may, instead of ordering the forfeiture of the property, order the offender to pay a fine equal to the value of the property (s. 462.37(3) Cr. C.). Although the use of the word “may” indicates that Parliament intended courts to have some discretion, I am of the view that this discretion does not allow them to limit the amount of a fine in lieu to the profit made from a criminal activity, even in cases where this would be consistent with the dual objective of deprivation of proceeds and deterrence. I will explain why.

[27]                        First, the wording of s. 462.37(3) Cr. C. is categorical with respect to the amount of the fine. As this Court stated in Lavigne, “[t]he words are crystal clear. Parliament has itself determined the amount of the fine” (para. 34). The fine is “equal to the value of the property” that is proceeds of crime (para. 35; R. v. Rafilovich, 2019 SCC 51, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 838, at para. 33).

[28]                        It is true that the term “proceeds of crime” encompasses not only property but also any “benefit” or “advantage” (s. 462.3(1) Cr. C.). The inclusion of these words in the definition of “proceeds of crime” can be explained by the fact that certain designated offences, such as fraud on the government (s. 121(1) Cr. C.) and municipal corruption (s. 123(1) Cr. C.), involve, among other things, the offer or acceptance of an “advantage” or “benefit”. However, the fine in lieu provision is limited to the concept of “property”, and the value of the property in question dictates the amount of the fine.

[29]                        The term “property” as defined in the Criminal Code includes “property originally in the possession or under the control of any person, and any property into or for which it has been converted or exchanged and anything acquired at any time by the conversion or exchange” (s. 2 Cr. C.). This definition is broad enough to capture gross income derived from the sale of property obtained by crime (see R. v. Way, 2017 ONCA 754, 140 O.R. (3d) 309, at paras. 4‑7). In the words of R. W. Hubbard et al., “[t]he concept should clearly encompass all proceeds of crime not just those remaining after deducting expenses” (Money Laundering & Proceeds of Crime (2004), at p. 442). Moreover, distinguishing between an offender’s income and expenses in order to determine the offender’s profit margin would essentially amount to legitimating criminal activity. But Parliament specifically enacted s. 462.37(3) Cr. C. to deprive offenders of the fruits of their crimes and to take away any motivation for them to pursue their criminal purposes.

[30]                        Second, a court that limited the scope of a fine to the profit made by an offender from their criminal activities would be disregarding the nature of this order. It is only where forfeiture of property is impracticable that a fine may be ordered as a substitute (R. v. Angelis, 2016 ONCA 675, 133 O.R. (3d) 575, at para. 72; R. v. Ford, 2013 NBCA 63, 412 N.B.R. (2d) 196, at para. 5). Equivalency between the amount of the fine and the value of the property is inherent in the notion of substitution (Lavigne, at para. 35).

[31]                        Although this case involves maple syrup, the hierarchy among the various accomplices is not unlike that of a drug ring. By way of analogy, in R. v. Devloo and Ong, 2018 MBQB 140, at paras. 49‑51 (CanLII), the offender was ordered to pay a fine in lieu of $212,000, which corresponded to the amounts received in exchange for drugs. The offender’s profit was only $4,000, as the balance had been redistributed to other members of the criminal organization. The trial court nonetheless refused to limit the amount of the fine to $4,000 in the absence of evidence establishing an allocation of benefits between the offender and his co‑accused, and that decision was correctly affirmed by the Manitoba Court of Appeal (R. v. Devloo, 2020 MBCA 3, 384 C.C.C. (3d) 288, at para. 92).

[32]                        In this regard, P. M. German notes that “[t]he arrest of one player resembles ‘spin the bottle’, with the bottle facing a person who ends up being responsible for the gross value of the drugs, while other persons in the organization, not arrested, do not share the burden” (Proceeds of Crime and Money Laundering: Includes Analysis of Civil Forfeiture and Terrorist Financing Legislation (loose‑leaf), at § 15:28). This seemingly harsh result stems from the nature of a fine in lieu: if the drugs had been found in the offender’s hands, they would have been forfeited in their entirety (§ 15:28).

[33]                        Lastly, limiting a fine in lieu to the profit made by an offender from their criminal activities undermines and disregards what Parliament intended (R. v. Banayos and Banayos, 2018 MBCA 86, 365 C.C.C. (3d) 528, at para. 64). As this Court stated in Quebec (Attorney General) v. Laroche, 2002 SCC 72, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 708, “[t]he legislative objective of Part XII.2 plainly goes beyond mere punishment of crime” (para. 25; see also Lavigne, at para. 25; Dieckmann, at para. 88). A fine in lieu is not part of the global sentence imposed on an offender for the commission of a designated offence (Lavigne, at paras. 25‑26; R. v. Schoer, 2019 ONCA 105, 371 C.C.C. (3d) 292, at para. 93; Angelis, at para. 44; R. v. Dritsas, 2015 MBCA 19, 315 Man. R. (2d) 205, at para. 56; R. v. Khatchatourov, 2014 ONCA 464, 313 C.C.C. (3d) 94, at para. 55). It follows that the amount of the fine does not vary based on an offender’s degree of moral blameworthiness or the circumstances of the offence. Rather, the dual objective of the fine is to deprive an offender of the proceeds of their crime and to deter them from reoffending. But the objective of deterrence is not focused only on the actual offender: it also applies to potential accomplices and criminal organizations (Lavigne, at para. 23).

[34]                        Through the severity of the proceeds of crime provisions, Parliament is sending a clear message that “crime does not pay” and is thus attempting to discourage individuals from organizing themselves and committing profit‑driven crimes. In Lavigne, Deschamps J. noted that “[t]he effectiveness of the adopted methods depends largely on the severity of the new provisions and on their deterrent effect” (para. 9). Parliament’s decision that the fine must correspond to the value of the property is therefore deliberately harsh. Reducing a fine to the profit made by an offender from their criminal activities would clearly be contrary to this objective.

[35]                        In summary, the discretion conferred on courts by s. 462.37(3) Cr. C. does not allow them to limit the amount of a fine in lieu to the profit made from criminal activity. In accordance with the principles set out in Lavigne, judicial discretion applies first to the decision whether or not to impose a fine and second to the determination of the value of the property (para. 35).

[36]                        At this second step, the Crown’s burden is only to show that the offender had possession or control of property that is proceeds of crime and to establish the value of that property (Angelis, at para. 35; Dwyer, at paras. 24‑27). The Crown does not have to prove that the offender personally benefited from the proceeds of crime (R. v. Piccinini, 2015 ONCA 446, at para. 19 (CanLII); R. v. Siddiqi, 2015 ONCA 374, at para. 6 (CanLII)). Nor does the court have to consider the offender’s subsequent use of the property, such as how cash was spent by the offender (Schoer, at para. 105; R. v. Dow, 2014 NBCA 15, 418 N.B.R. (2d) 222, at para. 37; R. v. S. (A.), 2010 ONCA 441, 258 C.C.C. (3d) 13, at para. 14).

[37]                        The determination of the value of the property must be based on the evidence and not on [translation] “a purely hypothetical calculation that does not correspond to reality” (R. v. Grenier, 2017 QCCA 57, at para. 33 (CanLII)). In a situation involving the resale of property obtained by crime, as in this case, the proceeds of crime are, in principle, the sum obtained in exchange for the property originally in the offender’s possession or under their control, in keeping with the definition of the word “property” in s. 2 Cr. C. That sum is not necessarily equal to the market value of the property sold by the offender. It must be kept in mind that the purpose of a fine in lieu is to deprive an offender of the proceeds of their crime, not to compensate for the victim’s loss, which is the function of a restitution order (R. v. Lawrence, 2018 ONCA 676, at paras. 14‑15 (CanLII)). Finally, an offender’s ability to pay must not be considered in determining the amount of a fine in lieu, any more than in deciding whether or not to impose a fine (Rafilovich, at para. 32; Lavigne, at para. 37).

(3)         Discretion to Apportion the Value of Property Between Co‑accused

[38]                        Having outlined the general principles governing the determination of the amount of a fine in lieu, I now turn to situations involving co‑accused, which raise particular issues. This Court has not previously considered whether, on an exceptional basis, an offender may be ordered to pay less than the total value of the property that was in their possession or under their control where several co‑accused had possession or control of the same property that constitutes proceeds of crime. More specifically, this case involves successive possession of the same property, namely the $10,000,000 that was in Mr. Vallières’s possession and under his control, only part of which he ultimately kept following a redistribution to his accomplices.

[39]                        In my opinion, courts may divide the value of property among several co‑accused in order to avoid a risk of double recovery. This risk arises where the Crown seeks to have a fine in lieu imposed on more than one offender in relation to the same proceeds of crime. At the stage of imposing a fine in lieu, one can speak only of a “risk” of double recovery, for it may well be that this scenario will never materialize given the fact that some co‑accused might be unable to pay their fine within the time allotted. However, this possibility does not prevent a court from apportioning the fine between co‑accused if there is a risk of double recovery, if apportionment is requested by the offender and if the evidence allows this determination to be made.

[40]                        The onus is on the offender to make the request and to satisfy the court that it is appropriate to apportion the value of the property between co‑accused, since apportionment is an exception to the general principle that the amount of the fine must correspond to the value of the property that was in the offender’s possession or under their control.

[41]                        This discretion to apportion, the exercise of which is governed by the guiding principle that double recovery should be avoided, is in keeping with the objective of s. 462.37(3) Cr. C. and with the nature of the order (Lavigne, at para. 27).

[42]                        First of all, apportioning the value of the property between co‑accused is consistent with the dual objective of deprivation of proceeds and deterrence. Each co‑accused is deprived of the fruits of their criminal activity and, at the same time, the total value of the property remains recoverable. Second, such apportionment is consistent with the nature of an order substituting a fine for forfeiture. The imposition of a fine that exceeds the total value of the property, or of several fines that together do so, is incompatible with the idea that the fine is imposed instead of forfeiture. If the property had been available, it would have been forfeited just once.

(a)           Principles Guiding the Exercise of the Discretion to Apportion

[43]                        The exercise of a court’s discretion is limited by the circumstances in which an order is made (Lavigne, at para. 27). The conditions under which a court may exercise its discretion to apportion are as follows.

[44]                        First, it is not enough for an offender to argue that they transferred the property to a third party in order to be entitled to apportionment. For the offender to raise a risk of double recovery, that third party must have been charged as well (Siddiqi, at para. 6). The issue of double recovery obviously does not arise where the offender is the only person who stands trial (Schoer, at para. 95, fn. 2).

[45]                        In this regard, Dieckmann is a unique case. There could be no actual risk of double recovery because the accomplices had died, but apportionment of the total amount of the fraud between the offender and her accomplices was nonetheless justified in the circumstances. The evidence showed that the proceeds of the fraud had been divided, the deceased accomplices were clearly guilty of the alleged offence and, above all, the Crown conceded that it would have apportioned the value of the property among the accomplices if they had stood trial.

[46]                        Second, the evidence must show that several co‑accused had possession or control of the same property, or part of it, at some point in time (R. v. Lawlor, 2021 ONCA 692, at para. 27 (CanLII)). In Dieckmann, the Ontario Court of Appeal correctly stated that “if there is evidence before the court that establishes or admits of an allocation of benefit, it is open to the court to exercise its discretion to adjust the quantum of the fine” (para. 100).

[47]                        In R. v. Chung, 2021 ONCA 188, 402 C.C.C. (3d) 145, the Ontario Court of Appeal, interpreting its own decision in Dieckmann, also stated the following:

      Where there are multiple offenders before the court, however, and the property passed through the hands of one offender to another without the first offender retaining the benefit of the full value of the property, the sentencing judge may allocate a portion of the fine less than the full value of the property that had been under the offender’s possession and control, so long as the balance of the total value of the proceeds of crime are distributed to the other offenders before the court. . . . [Emphasis added; para. 101.]

[48]                        I agree with this statement. In principle, an offender’s fine may be reduced only in proportion to the amount of the fines imposed on the offender’s co‑accused who are sentenced in the same proceeding, such that the total value of the property remains recoverable. This discretionary exercise is approximate in nature and is entitled to deference. For example, in R. v. Sam (1998), 1998 CanLII 12298 (SK CA), 163 Sask. R. 314, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal chose to allocate the total value of illicit substances equally between two co‑accused who had run a drug trafficking operation together (paras. 15‑17).

[49]                        The apportionment exercise presents special difficulties where an offender’s co‑accused are tried in separate proceedings. In such a situation, the court may consider the fines already imposed on the co‑accused if it is satisfied that they create a risk of double recovery of the same property. That being said, the fact that some co‑accused have not yet stood trial at the time an offender is sentenced should not deprive the offender of the benefit of apportionment. The court cannot foresee whether fines will be imposed on the offender’s co‑accused in the other proceedings or what their amount might be. To overcome this problem, the court need only find that the available evidence would have allowed it to impose a fine on the co‑accused if they had been before it, thereby justifying apportionment based on the risk of double recovery. In the end, the manner in which this discretion is exercised will depend on the circumstances of each case.

[50]                        Where the conditions giving rise to a possibility of double recovery are met, the court must apportion the value of the property between the co‑accused in order to prevent this risk from materializing. The court has no choice but to proceed in this manner, because it must exercise its discretion in keeping with the nature of a fine in lieu, which replaces the property that cannot be forfeited, nothing more and nothing less. However, given the approximate nature of the exercise, the court retains some flexibility in deciding how the value of the property will be apportioned between the co‑accused.

(b)         Duty Owed by the Crown

[51]                        While the burden of raising apportionment and establishing its appropriateness rests on the offender, this does not mean that the Crown is relieved of all responsibility in this regard.

[52]                        To mitigate the risk of double recovery, the Crown should, to the extent possible and on its own initiative, apportion the value of the property that is proceeds of crime between the co‑accused where it has evidence indicating that they had simultaneous or successive possession or control of that same property or of part of it. This is a duty that is part of the Crown’s “Minister of Justice” role, which excludes any notion of winning or losing (R. v. Regan, 2002 SCC 12, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 297, at para. 65).

[53]                        The Crown should discharge this duty in every case, but especially where the co‑accused are tried separately. The Crown has an overview of the various proceedings and can limit up front the amount it seeks as a fine in lieu in each proceeding in order to ensure that the total of the fines imposed on the co‑accused corresponds to the value of the property that is proceeds of crime.

[54]                        As an illustration, if the Crown has evidence that an offender had control over a total of $100,000 derived from fraud and then distributed $50,000 to their co‑accused, the Crown should seek only $50,000 in each proceeding rather than deliberately creating a risk of double recovery by seeking $100,000 from the first offender.

[55]                        Of course, the Crown remains free to forgo seeking a fine in lieu or to limit the amount of the fine as part of a joint submission on the sentence of one of the co‑accused. Where the Crown forgoes seeking a fine or a portion thereof, there is clearly no possibility of double recovery in respect of the amount the offender has been exempted from paying. As a result, the offender’s co‑accused may not rely on that amount to limit their own fines. As stated above, only where there is a possibility of double recovery can a court exercise its discretion to apportion, in keeping with the nature of a fine in lieu as a substitute for forfeiture. The amount of the fine is determined on the basis of the value of the property that can no longer be forfeited, not on the basis of considerations relating to fairness or an offender’s ability to pay.

(c)           Conclusion

[56]                        In summary, a fine in lieu must, in principle, be equal to the value of the property of which an offender had possession or control at some point in time. The exception to this principle, whereby an offender may be ordered to pay less than the total value of the property that was in their possession or under their control, is justified by a concern for avoiding double recovery of the value of the same property from a number of co‑accused.

(4)         Application to the Facts of the Case

[57]                        In this case, the Court of Appeal reduced the fine imposed on Mr. Vallières on the ground that a court can set a fine that reflects an offender’s profit margin, provided that this penalty meets the dual objective of deprivation of proceeds and deterrence (para. 245 (CanLII)). In doing so, the Court of Appeal relied on a misreading of Dieckmann and thereby assumed a discretion it did not have.

[58]                        Dieckmann is not a departure from the principle that the fine must be equal to the value of the property; rather, that decision states that the value of the property may be apportioned between co‑accused where the evidence shows that they had possession or control of it at some point. The decision does not establish a new approach based on the profit made by an offender.

[59]                        With regard to the dual objective of deprivation of proceeds and deterrence, Parliament has clearly specified the means chosen to achieve its end: the fine must be equal to the value of the property. On this point, the Court of Appeal erred in stating that [translation] “[t]he eight‑year term of imprisonment, combined with a $1,000,000 fine in lieu, fully meets [the objective of deterrence]” (para. 249). The eight‑year term of imprisonment was the punishment imposed on Mr. Vallières for the commission of the designated offences, whereas the fine was intended to replace the property whose forfeiture had become impracticable. The purpose of ordering a fine in lieu is not to punish an offender for the commission of an offence. The overall deterrent effect of a fine and a term of imprisonment therefore plays no role in determining the appropriate amount, which has been set by Parliament.

[60]                        Moreover, contrary to what the Court of Appeal stated, Lavigne does not stand for the proposition that a fine in lieu can be limited to the profit made by an offender from their criminal activities (paras. 243‑44). That decision clearly indicates that the fine must correspond to the value of the property (Lavigne, at para. 35). In that case, this Court ordered the offender to pay the $150,000 fine in lieu sought by the Crown because the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the offender had made at least that much from drug trafficking. The value of the property could not be determined otherwise.

[61]                        The Court of Appeal also erred in finding that Mr. Vallières had never had $10,000,000 in his possession while at the same time stating that the money in question had served as an input that allowed him to purchase more syrup for resale (para. 250). By his own admission, Mr. Vallières had control over that amount, which was in his hands or in his bank accounts at some point. From that moment on, the proceeds of crime provisions applied. The manner in which Mr. Vallières subsequently used the money, namely to buy more maple syrup, was not relevant to the analysis.

[62]                        Furthermore, in this Court and for the first time, Mr. Vallières takes issue with the trial judge’s failure to apportion the $10,000,000 between his co‑accused and him. It is sufficient to note that Mr. Vallières did not prove at trial, or on appeal for that matter, that there was a risk of double recovery of that amount, which meant that the trial judge in fact had no choice but to order him to pay a fine equal to that amount.

[63]                        Nor can the Crown be reproached for not discharging its duty in this case. At the time of the trial, the Crown’s theory was that Mr. Vallières had paid only his co‑accused Sylvain Bourassa, Martin Vallières and Yves Lapierre, his other accomplices having had possession or control of proceeds of crime from other sources. From the Crown’s perspective, the fine imposed on Mr. Vallières gave rise to a possibility of double recovery only with respect to the fines imposed on Sylvain Bourassa, Martin Vallières and Yves Lapierre, which totalled $204,400.

[64]                        However, in light of the evidence available to the Crown, that possibility of double recovery was non‑existent. Considering, as a guide, that the value of the stolen syrup was over $18,000,000, the Crown could reasonably infer that Mr. Vallières, as the directing mind of the operation, had controlled an amount much greater than $10,204,400. Indeed, the evidence shows that Mr. Vallières had [translation] “at least $10,000,000” under his control (C.A. reasons, at para. 176). The Crown could therefore legitimately seek such an amount from him without deliberately creating a risk of double recovery.

[65]                        Moreover, even with account taken of all the fines ultimately imposed on Mr. Vallières’s co‑accused in connection with the criminal enterprise involving the theft of maple syrup, which together amounted to about $2,000,000, the possibility of double recovery remained negligible from the Crown’s perspective, insofar as it could reasonably assume that Mr. Vallières had actually exercised control over an amount close to the value of the stolen syrup.

[66]                        In the end, Mr. Vallières did not meet his burden, and he must therefore be required to pay a fine equal to the value of the property that was in his possession or under his control, that is, $10,000,000. Even though the amount of the fine in lieu may seem high, it is warranted in light of the scheme for the forfeiture of proceeds of crime.

B.            Did the Court of Appeal Err in Failing to Allow the Parties to Be Heard Regarding the Change to the Amount of the Fine in Lieu, Given That This Question Had Not Been Raised on Appeal?

[67]                        Given my answer to the first question, it is unnecessary to decide the second issue in order to dispose of the appeal. Suffice it to say that the determination of the amount of a fine in lieu involves different legal and factual considerations than the question of whether such a fine should be imposed on an offender, as this case shows. In such circumstances, a court should provide the parties with an opportunity to make submissions before deciding a question on which they have not had a chance to comment (R. v. Mian, 2014 SCC 54, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 689).

VI.         Disposition

[68]                        For these reasons, the appeal is allowed. The fine imposed on Mr. Vallières is set at $9,171,397.57, that is, $10,000,000 minus the amount of the restitution order, $828,602.43. Mr. Vallières has 10 years to pay this fine, in default of which he is subject to imprisonment for 6 years consecutive to any other term of imprisonment.

 

                    Appeal allowed.

                    Moldaver and Jamal JJ. —

I.               Overview

[1]                             This appeal concerns the permissible scope of a search incident to arrest in a person’s home. In particular, the Court has been asked to delineate the proper balance under s. 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms between an accused’s privacy interests in their home and valid law enforcement objectives, when the police search an accused’s home incident to their lawful arrest. As we will explain, a proper balancing of those factors requires modifying the common law standard governing searches incident to arrest.

[2]                             This case arises in the aftermath of a volatile arrest in the home of the appellant, Matthew Stairs, for domestic violence. The police responded to a 9‑1‑1 caller who reported seeing a man repeatedly hitting a woman in a car. Police officers promptly located the suspect car parked in the driveway of an unknown house. After a quick scan of the car’s interior, they knocked on the front door of the house and loudly announced their presence, but no one answered. Fearing for the woman’s safety, the police entered the house. Upon announcing their presence, a woman with fresh injuries to her face came up a flight of stairs leading from the basement. Mr. Stairs did not follow. Instead, he ran past the bottom of the staircase and barricaded himself in the basement laundry room, where he was arrested a short time later.

[3]                             After the arrest, the police conducted a visual clearing search of the basement living room area, from which Mr. Stairs and the woman had just emerged. The purpose of the search was to ensure that nobody else was present and that there were no hazards or weapons sitting out in the open. During the search, the police saw a clear container and a plastic bag in plain view containing methamphetamine. This resulted in Mr. Stairs being charged with possession for the purpose of trafficking (contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19), in addition to charges of assault and breach of probation (contrary to ss. 266 and 733.1(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46). He was convicted of all charges at trial. 

[4]                             Mr. Stairs appealed his conviction for the drug offence on the basis that the drug evidence was improperly admitted. In a split decision, a majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario upheld the conviction. The dissenting judge would have set aside the conviction and entered an acquittal.

[5]                             Mr. Stairs now appeals as of right to this Court regarding his conviction for the drug offence. He argues that the common law standard for search incident to arrest must be modified for searches conducted in a home given the very high privacy interests that apply to a person’s home. He asserts that where the police search for safety purposes, as alleged in his case, they can only do so if they have reasonable grounds to believe, or at least suspect, that there is an imminent threat to public or police safety. Mr. Stairs claims that this standard was not met and that the search of the basement living room by the police was therefore unconstitutional. Further, he says, the methamphetamine seized by the police should have been excluded from the evidence and an acquittal must be entered with respect to the charge of possession of a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking.

[6]                             The baseline common law standard for search incident to arrest requires that the individual searched has been lawfully arrested, that the search is truly incidental to the arrest in the sense that it is for a valid law enforcement purpose connected to the arrest, and that the search is conducted reasonably (R. v. Fearon, 2014 SCC 77, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 621, at paras. 21 and 27). In the past, this Court has tailored this standard in several contexts to comply with s. 8 of the Charter. The search incident to arrest power has been eliminated for the seizure of bodily samples (R. v. Stillman, 1997 CanLII 384 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 607), and the standard has been modified in other situations presenting a heightened privacy interest in the subject matter of the search, such as strip searches, penile swabs, and cell phone searches (R. v. Golden, 2001 SCC 83, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 679; R. v. Saeed, 2016 SCC 24, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 518; Fearon).

[7]                             While we agree with Mr. Stairs that the common law standard should be modified — and made stricter — to reflect an accused’s heightened privacy interest in their home, we do not accept the test he proposes. Given the facts of this case, his submissions were directed solely to safety searches and did not extend to investigative purposes, such as evidence preservation and evidence discovery.

[8]                             Balancing the demands of effective law enforcement and a person’s right to privacy in their home, we conclude that the common law standard for a search of a home incident to arrest must be modified, depending on whether the area searched is within or outside the physical control of the arrested person. Where the area searched is within the arrested person’s physical control, the common law standard continues to apply. However, where the area is outside their physical control, but it is still sufficiently proximate to the arrest, a search of a home incident to arrest for safety purposes will be valid only if:

•         the police have reason to suspect that there is a safety risk to the police, the accused, or the public which would be addressed by a search; and

•         the search is conducted in a reasonable manner, tailored to the heightened privacy interests in a home.

[9]                             Given the factual matrix of this case, it is not necessary to decide whether reasonable suspicion also applies to investigation-related purposes, such as evidence preservation and evidence discovery. We leave this issue for another day.

[10]                        Applying the stricter standard to this case, the police, in our view, had reason to suspect that there was a safety risk in the basement living room and that their concerns would be addressed by a quick scan of the room, which was the least intrusive manner of search possible in the circumstances. It follows that Mr. Stairs’ s. 8 Charter rights were not breached, and the drug evidence was properly admitted. Accordingly, we would dismiss the appeal.

II.            Facts

[11]                        A civilian called 9‑1‑1 to report that he had witnessed a male driver striking his female passenger. The caller said the man was swerving on the road while hitting the woman in a “flurry of strikes”. At one point, the man had the woman in a headlock and she looked like she was “turtling” (huddling to protect herself).

[12]                        Three officers — Officers Brown, Martin, and Vandervelde — were dispatched to investigate the reported assault. They quickly located a car closely matching the caller’s description parked in the driveway of an unknown home. The officers ran the plate number and were informed that the car was registered to Mr. Stairs’ father, who also lived at the home. The police also learned that Mr. Stairs was a known driver of the car and that he had cautions for escape risk, family violence, and violence. He was also listed as a high‑risk offender.

[13]                        After briefly looking inside the car, the police knocked on the front door of the house several times and loudly announced their presence, but no one answered. Believing the woman might be in danger, two of the officers entered the house through an unlocked side door and then opened the front door for their colleague. The officers continued to announce their presence and shouted at everyone in the house to “come upstairs” with their “hands up” (2018 ONSC 3747, 412 C.R.R. (2d) 95 (“pre‑trial application reasons”), at para. 86). A woman, seen to be coming from the right side of the basement, made her way up to the first floor. She had fresh injuries, including markings and swelling around her forehead and eyes, cuts on her cheek, and scratches. Officer Brown spoke with her briefly. He testified that while she was not combative, she was not cooperative either. Officer Martin, then a constable‑in‑training, remained upstairs with her, while the other two officers turned their attention to her assailant.

[14]                        From the top of the stairs, Officer Vandervelde saw a man, who turned out to be Mr. Stairs, run past the bottom of the staircase from the right side of the basement to the left side. Officer Vandervelde briefly made eye contact with him. Mr. Stairs ignored the police commands to come upstairs with his hands up. Instead, he locked himself in the basement laundry room adjacent to the living room from where he and the woman had just emerged.

[15]                        Officer Vandervelde and Officer Brown moved downstairs to arrest Mr. Stairs. On the way down, they took a quick look over their shoulders at the basement living room; their focus, however, was on Mr. Stairs, who by now was in the laundry room located to the left of the staircase. Officer Vandervelde had his firearm drawn, and Officer Brown had his taser drawn. At one point, Mr. Stairs opened the laundry room door, shrieked, and immediately closed the door. Eventually, he came out and complied with the officers’ commands. Officer Brown handcuffed and searched him, locating only a sum of money. Officer Brown also looked around the laundry room to confirm that no one else was there. Four minutes had passed from when the police knocked on the front door to the arrest. Officer Brown described the situation as fast‑moving and dynamic.

[16]                        After the arrest, Officer Vandervelde conducted a visual clearing search of the adjoining living room, which contained a coffee table, a couch, a television, and cabinets. From where he was standing, he could not see what was behind the couch or the television stand, so he walked behind the couch. There, he saw a transparent plastic Tupperware container in plain view on the floor. It contained glass‑like shards, which he believed to be methamphetamine. He said that the container was about a foot from the couch and that he did not have to move any items to see it. He also saw a ziplock bag next to the coffee table that looked like it contained methamphetamine. He did not open any doors or cupboards in the living room.

[17]                        At a pre-trial application to exclude evidence, Officer Vandervelde maintained that the purpose of the clearing search was to confirm that “no one else was there” and that there were “no other hazards” (pre‑trial application reasons, para. 282). When asked whether he was looking for weapons connected to the assault, he said: “Not, not necessarily connected to the assault, no. You don’t want to be in a basement where weapons or firearms are sitting out in [the] open though” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 225).

[18]                        Officer Vandervelde was shown a photo of the area behind the couch and asked in chief to put an “X” where he had found the Tupperware container. He could not say exactly where, only that it was behind the couch in an open area on the ground. He also could not remember whether he removed the lid before or after he left the home.

[19]                        After Officer Brown looked around the laundry room to confirm that no one else was there, he went upstairs to speak to the woman again. At the pre-trial application, he testified that she provided little information. She denied that Mr. Stairs had assaulted her and insisted that they were just “playing around” (pre‑trial application reasons, para. 28).

III.         Decisions Below

[20]                        Mr. Stairs brought a pre‑trial application alleging several violations of his rights under s. 8 of the Charter (the right against unreasonable search and seizure) and s. 9 of the Charter (the right against arbitrary detention). The only issue that remains before this Court is whether the clearing search of the basement living room was a lawful search incident to arrest. Our summaries of the decisions under review focus on this issue.

A.           Ontario Superior Court of Justice, 2018 ONSC 3747, 412 C.R.R. (2d) 95 (Coats J.)

[21]                        The trial judge found no breach of s. 8 of the Charter. It was reasonable for the officers to do a quick scan of the basement living room after Mr. Stairs was arrested. Much as the officers had taken a passing over‑the‑shoulder look at the room on their way down to the basement, their focus at the time was on Mr. Stairs, who was, by then, in the laundry room.

[22]                        The search had a valid objective. Officer Vandervelde testified that he went to the living room to make sure that no one else was there and that there were no other hazards. This objective was reasonable because both the woman and Mr. Stairs had come from this area, the officers could not see fully into the living room as they came down the stairs, and their initial momentary glance did not completely address safety concerns.

[23]                        The search and resulting seizure were lawful. The Tupperware container and bag in which the methamphetamine was found were both in plain view and transparent. While Officer Vandervelde could not mark the exact location of the Tupperware container on a photo of the living room, this did not weaken his testimony about its general location. In addition, the trial judge accepted Officer Vandervelde’s testimony that he believed there was methamphetamine in the container and the plastic bag before picking them up. As a result, the trial judge found no basis to exclude the methamphetamine.

B.            Court of Appeal for Ontario, 2020 ONCA 678, 153 O.R. (3d) 32 (Fairburn A.C.J.O. and Harvison Young J.A., Nordheimer J.A. Dissenting)

(1)         Majority — Fairburn A.C.J.O. and Harvison Young J.A.

[24]                        Writing for the majority, Fairburn A.C.J.O. dismissed the appeal. In her view, the trial judge correctly concluded that the search and subsequent seizure of the methamphetamine did not breach Mr. Stairs’ s. 8 Charter rights.

[25]                        The central disagreement between the majority and the dissent concerned the applicability of this Court’s decision in R. v. MacDonald, 2014 SCC 3, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 37. There, the Court held that the police needed reasonable grounds to believe that there was an imminent threat to public or police safety in order to enter and search a home.

[26]                        The majority rejected the applicability of this test because the factual matrix in MacDonald differed materially from this case. In the majority’s view, unlike MacDonald, the search here was a search incident to a lawful arrest and the common law standard for search incident to arrest applied — i.e., a search in the surrounding area of the arrest will be valid if the purpose of the search was a valid law enforcement objective connected to the arrest and the purpose was objectively reasonable in the circumstances.

[27]                        The search of the basement living room met this standard. The police searched the living room to ensure that no one else was there and that there were no other hazards. These safety concerns made sense in the circumstances: the police were in an unknown basement; they did not know how many people were in the house; they could not see behind the couch when coming down the stairs; and the living room was right next to the stairs, which the police needed to ascend to get Mr. Stairs out of the home safely. It was objectively reasonable for the police to take a quick visual scan of the basement living room. Since the methamphetamine was in plain view, the police were entitled to seize it under the plain view doctrine. Accordingly, the majority dismissed Mr. Stairs’ appeal from his conviction on the drug offence.

(2)         Dissent — Nordheimer J.A.

[28]                        In dissent, Nordheimer J.A. would have allowed Mr. Stairs’ appeal, set aside his conviction on the drug offence, and entered an acquittal. In his view, this case was indistinguishable from MacDonald. When the police engage in a safety search in a home without a warrant — even a search incident to a lawful arrest — they must have reasonable grounds to believe that there is an imminent threat to public or police safety.

[29]                        Here, the police had no reasonable grounds to believe, or even suspect, that there would be weapons, hazards, or other people in the living room that would pose a threat. Any concerns the police might have had about the possibility of guns amounted to no more than the type of vague safety concern that MacDonald cautioned against. As a result, the dissenting judge found a s. 8 Charter breach. He would have excluded the evidence under s. 24(2).

IV.         Issues

[30]                        This appeal raises two issues: (1) whether the search of the basement living room incident to arrest was unreasonable, contrary to s. 8 of the Charter; and (2) if so, whether the methamphetamine seized by the police should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter.

[31]                        For the reasons that follow, we would dismiss the appeal. We are not persuaded that Mr. Stairs’ s. 8 Charter rights were violated. Accordingly, we need not address s. 24(2) of the Charter.

V.           Analysis

[32]                        This Court has enunciated a two‑part analytical approach for determining whether the common law standard for search incident to arrest should be modified to comply with s. 8 of the Charter (see Stillman, Golden, Fearon, and Saeed):

(1)   Stage One: Determine whether the search satisfies the common law standard for search incident to arrest.

(2)   Stage Two: If so, determine whether the standard must be modified to comply with s. 8 of the Charter, given the particular privacy interests and law enforcement objectives at stake.

[33]                        Applying this approach, we conclude that the common law standard for search incident to arrest in a home must be modified.

A.           Stage One: The Common Law Standard for Search Incident to Arrest

[34]                        The common law standard for search incident to arrest permits the police to search a lawfully arrested person and to seize anything in their possession or the surrounding area of the arrest to guarantee the safety of the police and the arrested person, prevent the person’s escape, or provide evidence against them (Cloutier v. Langlois, 1990 CanLII 122 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 158, at pp. 180‑81). This search power is “extraordinary” because, unlike other police powers, it requires neither a warrant nor reasonable and probable grounds (Fearon, at paras. 16 and 45).

[35]                        The common law standard for search incident to arrest is well established. As explained in Fearon, at paras. 21 and 27, it requires that (1) the individual searched has been lawfully arrested; (2) the search is truly incidental to the arrest in the sense that it is for a valid law enforcement purpose connected to the arrest; and (3) the search is conducted reasonably.

[36]                        Under the second step, valid law enforcement purposes for search incident to arrest include (a) police and public safety; (b) preventing the destruction of evidence; and (c) discovering evidence that may be used at trial (Fearon, at para. 75).

[37]                        The police’s law enforcement purpose must be subjectively connected to the arrest, and the officer’s belief that the purpose will be served by the search must be objectively reasonable (R. v. Caslake, 1998 CanLII 838 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 51, at para. 19). To meet this standard, the police do not need reasonable and probable grounds for the search. Instead, they only require “some reasonable basis” to do what they did (Caslake, at para. 20). This is a much lower standard than reasonable and probable grounds.

[38]                        This Court explained the distinction between the “some reasonable basis” standard and the higher “reasonable and probable grounds” standard in Caslake, at para. 20:

To give an example, a reasonable and probable grounds standard would require a police officer to demonstrate a reasonable belief that an arrested person was armed with a particular weapon before searching the person. By contrast, under the standard that applies here, the police would be entitled to search an arrested person for a weapon if under the circumstances it seemed reasonable to check whether the person might be armed.

[39]                        Mr. Stairs does not dispute that the search of the living room met the common law standard for search incident to arrest. Instead, his primary submission is that the standard must be modified for a search of a home incident to arrest given the heightened privacy interests implicated in a home. We will therefore move directly to stage two.

B.            Stage Two: Determining Whether the Common Law Standard Must Be Modified

[40]                        In certain situations, the common law standard for search incident to arrest must be modified to give effect to s. 8 of the Charter. As indicated, this Court has modified the standard in several contexts to balance (a) the nature and extent of the privacy interests implicated; and (b) the importance of the police’s law enforcement objectives. The jurisprudence includes a spectrum of standards, with some contexts requiring a higher threshold for a search incident to arrest than others.

(1)         The Spectrum of Search Incident to Arrest Cases

[41]                        To determine the appropriate standard in this case, we begin by reviewing the standards in other cases, starting with the most stringent. We then place home searches on the spectrum.

[42]                        In Stillman, this Court determined that the common law standard for search incident to arrest does not apply to the seizure of bodily substances, including hair samples, teeth impressions, and buccal swabs. While bodily samples can help in investigating crimes, particularly for establishing identity, they are usually in no danger of disappearing if they are not immediately seized (para. 49). Since the seizure of bodily substances invades an area of personal privacy essential to dignity and bodily integrity, the police must obtain a warrant. They cannot seize bodily samples incident to arrest without a warrant.

[43]                        The next set of cases on the spectrum are Golden and Saeed, which modified the common law standard for strip searches and penile swabs, respectively.

[44]                        In Golden, the Court noted that, unlike frisk searches, which this Court considered in Cloutier, strip searches are particularly invasive because they require the removal of clothing and visual inspection of a person’s private areas. “Strip searches are . . . inherently humiliating and degrading”, and inevitably involve a serious infringement of dignity and privacy (Golden, at para. 90). Strip searches also rarely need to be done immediately due to the low risk of disposal or loss of evidence. Balancing these factors, the Court determined that a strip search requires (a) reasonable and probable grounds for the arrest itself; and (b) reasonable and probable grounds to conclude that a strip search is necessary in the particular circumstances of the arrest, that is, some evidence suggesting the possibility that the person arrested has concealed weapons or evidence related to the reason for arrest (Golden, at paras. 94 and 98). The strip search must also be done in a reasonable manner. The Court provided guidelines for when, where, and how strip searches are to be conducted.

[45]                        In Saeed, the Court looked to Golden and determined that there must be reasonable grounds to believe that a penile swab will afford evidence of the offence for which the accused was arrested. While penile swabs are very intrusive and impact the accused’s dignity, in sexual assault cases there is a risk that highly reliable evidence will be lost, either through destruction of the evidence or degradation over time. To ensure that penile swabs are conducted in a reasonable and respectful manner, the Court provided guidelines as to when, where, and how these tests are to be conducted.

[46]                        Lower down the spectrum than Golden and Saeed is Fearon, where this Court considered cell phone searches incident to arrest. To reflect the high expectation of privacy in cell phones, the Court modified the search incident to arrest power in three ways. First, “[b]oth the nature and the extent of the search performed on the cell phone must be truly incidental to the particular arrest for the particular offence” (para. 76). Second, the police are only permitted to search for the purpose of discovering evidence when the investigation would “be stymied or significantly hampered absent the ability to promptly search the cell phone incident to arrest” (para. 80). Third, “officers must make detailed notes of what they have examined on the cell phone” (para. 82).

[47]                        The lowest point on the spectrum of cases is where no change is required. An example is Caslake, where this Court declined to modify the common law standard for searches of vehicles incident to arrest. The Court found that there is no heightened expectation of privacy in a vehicle that would justify an exemption from the usual common law principles (para. 15).

(2)         Assessing Searches in the Home

[48]                        To situate this case on the spectrum of cases where the common law standard has been modified, we must consider the relevant privacy interests and the police’s law enforcement objectives in searches of a home incident to arrest.

(a)           Privacy Interest

[49]                        This Court has emphasized time and again that a person’s home attracts a high expectation of privacy. A fundamental and longstanding principle of a free society is that a person’s home is their castle (Eccles v. Bourque, 1974 CanLII 191 (SCC), [1975] 2 S.C.R. 739, at pp. 742‑43, per Dickson J. (as he then was), citing Semayne’s Case (1604), 5 Co. Rep. 91a, 77 E.R. 194, at p. 195). The home is “where our most intimate and private activities are most likely to take place” (R. v. Tessling, 2004 SCC 67, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 432, at para. 22). Moreover, this Court recognized in R. v. Silveira, 1995 CanLII 89 (SCC), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 297, at para. 140, per Cory J., that “[t]here is no place on earth where persons can have a greater expectation of privacy than within their ‘dwelling‑house’”.

[50]                        Given the privacy interests in the home, warrantless searches of the home are prima facie unreasonable. This was confirmed in R. v. Feeney, 1997 CanLII 342 (SCC), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 13, where the Court held that even if the police have an arrest warrant, they are not generally permitted to make an arrest in a home without a specific warrant permitting entry. Parliament later codified the principles in Feeney by introducing ss. 529 to 529.5 into the Criminal Code to govern when police may enter dwelling‑houses to carry out arrests.

[51]                        Although people undoubtedly have a heightened privacy interest in their homes, searches of the home are nonetheless less intrusive than strip searches and penile swabs, which inevitably impact a person’s dignity. As this Court noted in Stillman, “a violation of the sanctity of a person’s body is much more serious” than an intrusion into their home (para. 42, citing R. v. Pohoretsky, 1987 CanLII 62 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 945, at p. 949). In our view, while home searches may reveal highly personal and confidential information, they do not invariably infringe dignity and bodily integrity, as contemplated in Stillman, Golden, and Saeed.

(b)         Police Objectives

[52]                        The police’s law enforcement objectives will vary in searches of a home incident to arrest. Apart from the person targeted, there may be others in the home, including potential victims needing help or aggressors posing a safety risk. While the circumstances of each case may differ, arrests within the home are often volatile and dynamic.

[53]                        Overall, the risks at play in the context of an in‑home arrest are likely to be more pressing than those involved in strip searches and penile swabs. For strip searches, there is generally a low risk that hidden objects can be accessed or disposed of quickly (Golden, at para. 93). For penile swabs, there are no safety risks at play.

(c)           Balancing Privacy and Police Objectives

[54]                        Balancing privacy interests in the home and police objectives leads us to conclude that home searches fall lower on the spectrum than Golden and Saeed. While home searches implicate serious privacy interests, they do not inevitably intrude into a person’s dignity and bodily integrity. In addition, the police objectives will often be pressing and time‑sensitive in the context of in‑home arrests.

[55]                        Given the placement of home searches on the spectrum of cases, we cannot accept the Crown’s submission that the common law standard provides sufficient protection for searches incident to arrest conducted in a home, including safety searches. That standard is too low given the privacy interests in the home. Nor do we accept Mr. Stairs’ position — in line with the dissent at the Court of Appeal — that police safety searches incident to arrest in a home require a reasonable belief of imminent harm. That standard is too high given the pressing police objectives at stake. A proper balancing of privacy and police objectives requires a modification of the common law standard that falls between those two poles.

(3)         Modifications to the Common Law Standard

[56]                        To pass constitutional muster, the common law standard for search incident to arrest must be modified in two ways that make the standard stricter where the police search areas of the home outside the arrested person’s physical control:

•         the police must have reason to suspect that there is a safety risk to the police, the accused, or the public which would be addressed by a search; and

•         the search must be conducted in a reasonable manner, tailored to the heightened privacy interests in a home.

[57]                        To facilitate comparison, we reiterate that the common law standard permits a search of the person arrested and the surrounding area of the arrest when (1) the arrest is lawful; (2) the search is incidental to the arrest, such that there is some reasonable basis for the search connected to the arrest and the search is for a valid law enforcement purpose, including safety, evidence preservation, or evidence discovery; and (3) the nature and extent of the search are reasonable. This standard was applied by the majority of the Court of Appeal in the case at hand.

[58]                        We will now explain each of the two modifications.

(a)           Reasonable Suspicion Required for Areas Outside the Arrested Person’s Physical Control

(i)           Defining the Surrounding Area of the Arrest

[59]                        A search incident to arrest extends to the surrounding area of an arrest. However, this concept must be further calibrated to account for the unique considerations entailed by a search of a home. We must therefore distinguish between two subcategories within the surrounding area of an arrest:

(a)   the area within the physical control of the person arrested at the time of arrest; and

(b)   areas outside the physical control of that person, but which are part of the surrounding area because they are sufficiently proximate to the arrest.

The purpose of this distinction is to recognize that the more extensive the warrantless search, the greater the potential for violating privacy. As we explain below, different standards must be applied to these subcategories.

[60]                        The task of determining whether a particular area is part of the surrounding area of the arrest and which subcategory it falls under lies with the trial judge. Consistent with this Court’s jurisprudence, whether an area is sufficiently proximate to the arrest is a contextual and case‑specific inquiry. The key question is whether there is a “link between the location and purpose of the search and the grounds for the arrest” (R. v. Nolet, 2010 SCC 24, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 851, at para. 49). The inquiry is highly contextual; the determination must be made using a purposive approach to ensure that the police can adequately respond to the wide variety of factual situations that may arise. Depending on the circumstances, the surrounding area may be wider or narrower. As one learned author notes: “A search incident to arrest can extend to the surrounding area, and so might include searching the building or vehicle in which the accused is arrested” (S. Coughlan, Criminal Procedure (4th ed. 2020), at p. 124).

[61]                        When the police make an arrest, under the existing common law standard, they may conduct a pat-down search and examine the area within the physical control of the person arrested. But when the police go outside the zone of physical control, the standard must be raised to recognize that the police have entered a home without a warrant. In these circumstances, it is not enough to satisfy the existing common law standard, which requires some reasonable basis for the search. Rather, the police must meet a higher standard: they must have reason to suspect that the search will address a valid safety purpose. We will say more about the reasonable suspicion standard in the section below.

[62]                        A similar approach has been adopted in the United States, where the jurisprudence distinguishes between areas inside and outside the arrested person’s physical control. Two cases, read together, illustrate this distinction. First, in Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752 (1969), at p. 763, the U.S. Supreme Court held that in the context of an in‑home arrest, the search incident to arrest power permits police to search (a) the arrestee’s person, as in a frisk search; and (b) the area “within his immediate control”, meaning the area in which the arrested person might reach for a weapon or destructible evidence.

[63]                        Second, in Maryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. 325 (1990), the U.S. Supreme Court considered areas outside those discussed in Chimel. The court held that the police may engage in a protective sweep of a home after an arrest when there is a reasonable suspicion of danger. Even so, the search is limited to a cursory inspection of the spaces where a person may be found and may last no longer than necessary to dispel the reasonable suspicion of danger.

[64]                        These cases, while obviously not binding, provide helpful persuasive authority illustrating the need to establish different standards for searches of areas inside and outside the arrested person’s physical control.

(ii)         The Nature of Reasonable Suspicion

[65]                        When the police search incident to arrest in a home for safety purposes, they must have reason to suspect that a search of areas outside the physical control of the arrested person will further the objective of police and public safety, including the safety of the accused. This modified standard, which is stricter than the basic common law standard, respects the privacy interests in the home while allowing the police to effectively fulfil their law‑enforcement responsibilities.

[66]                        Like the common law test, the purpose of the search must be subjectively connected to the arrest, and the officer’s belief that the purpose will be served by the search must be objectively reasonable. However, the objective requirement is stricter. To meet this stricter standard, the Crown must establish “objective facts [that] rise to the level of reasonable suspicion, such that a reasonable person, standing in the shoes of the police officer, would have held a reasonable suspicion” (R. v. Chehil, 2013 SCC 49, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 220, at para. 45).

[67]                        Reasonable suspicion is a higher standard than the common law standard for search incident to arrest. As this Court noted in Caslake, the search incident to arrest power arises from the fact of the lawful arrest (para. 13). All that is required is “some reasonable basis” for doing what the police did based on the arrest (para. 20). The common law standard is less stringent than the reasonable suspicion standard because it permits searches based on generalized concerns arising from the arrest, while the reasonable suspicion standard does not.

[68]                        By contrast, to establish reasonable suspicion, the police require a constellation of objectively discernible facts assessed against the totality of the circumstances giving rise to the suspicion of the risk. This assessment must be “fact‑based, flexible, and grounded in common sense and practical, everyday experience” (Chehil, at para. 29). In addition, the police must have reason to suspect that the search will address the risk. However, reasonable suspicion is a lower standard than reasonable and probable grounds because it is based on a possibility rather than a probability (Chehil, at para. 32).

[69]                        Whether the circumstances of a particular case give rise to reasonable suspicion must be assessed based on the totality of the circumstances (Chehil, at para. 26). Relevant considerations include (a) the need for a search; (b) the nature of the apprehended risk; (c) the potential consequences of not taking protective measures; (d) the availability of alternative measures; and (e) the likelihood that the contemplated risk actually exists (R. v. Golub (1997), 1997 CanLII 6316 (ON CA), 34 O.R. (3d) 743 (C.A.), at p. 758).

(iii)      The Rationale for Reasonable Suspicion

[70]                        Golub provides helpful guidance on the rationale for the reasonable suspicion standard. That case involved the entry and search of a home incident to arrest. After making an arrest outside a residence, the police continued to suspect that there was another person inside the apartment with a loaded submachine gun. The Court of Appeal for Ontario, per Doherty J.A., held that where the place to be searched is a home, the general principles set out in Cloutier do not apply. Justice Doherty noted that this Court’s decision in Feeney represented a shift in the law that gave greater protection to privacy interests in the home over law enforcement interests in most cases. He then reasoned that since warrantless arrests in a home are not generally permissible, similar reasoning should apply to warrantless searches of a home incident to arrest (pp. 755-56).

[71]                        Justice Doherty held that searches of a home incident to arrest should be “generally prohibited subject to exceptional circumstances where the law enforcement interest is so compelling that it overrides the individual’s right to privacy within the home” (p. 756). The police must have “a reasonable suspicion, based on the particular circumstances of the arrest” (pp. 758-59) that they need to conduct the search to protect the safety of those at the scene of the arrest (p. 758).

[72]                        In Golub, the police entered the home to conduct a search incident to arrest, whereas here the police were already lawfully in the home under exigent circumstances when they conducted the search incident to arrest. Despite this difference, in our view, the principles which led the court in Golub to require a standard of reasonable suspicion apply equally here. Simply because the police have entered the home for a valid reason does not give them carte blanche to wander through the home at large where the circumstances do not call for it. As we have explained, the more extensive the warrantless search, the greater the potential for violating privacy. Thus, when the police search a home incident to arrest in areas outside the physical control of the arrested person at the time of arrest, they require reasonable suspicion.

[73]                        In concluding that reasonable suspicion applies to searches of a home incident to arrest, Doherty J.A. balanced the privacy interests in the home and the relevant police objectives. Given the factual matrix in Golub, he was particularly concerned about the police interest in protecting the safety of persons at the scene of the arrest. In that regard, he made the following astute observations, with which we fully agree:

. . . I am concerned with the police interest in protecting the safety of those at the scene of the arrest. This interest is often the most compelling concern at an arrest scene and is one which must be addressed immediately. In deciding whether the police were justified in taking steps to ensure their safety, the realities of the arrest situation must be acknowledged. Often, and this case is a good example, the atmosphere at the scene of an arrest is a volatile one and the police must expect the unexpected. The price paid if inadequate measures are taken to secure the scene of an arrest can be very high indeed. Just as it is wrong to engage in ex post facto justifications of police conduct, it is equally wrong to ignore the realities of the situations in which police officers must make these decisions. [Emphasis added; p. 757.]

[74]                        When assessing police conduct, the reviewing judge must be alive to the volatility and uncertainty that police officers face — the police must expect the unexpected. This reality is inherent in the police’s exercise of their common law powers, as well as their statutory duties, including “the preservation of the peace, the prevention of crime, and the protection of life and property” (R. v. Godoy, 1999 CanLII 709 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 311, at para. 15 (emphasis deleted), citing Dedman v. The Queen, 1985 CanLII 41 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 2, at pp. 11‑12; Police Services Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.15, s. 42). Given their mandate, “police officers must be empowered to respond quickly, effectively, and flexibly to the diversity of encounters experienced daily on the front lines of policing” (R. v. Mann, 2004 SCC 52, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 59, at para. 16). A reasonable suspicion standard ensures that the police may carry out these duties, while also balancing the enhanced privacy in a person’s home.

(iv)      No Requirement for Reasonable Belief in Imminent Harm

[75]                        In adopting a reasonable suspicion standard, we reject Mr. Stairs’ proposed standard of reasonable belief in imminent harm, which was endorsed by the dissenting judge at the Court of Appeal. Both Mr. Stairs and the dissenting judge relied on MacDonald. However, MacDonald is distinguishable.

[76]                        In that case, the police attended Mr. MacDonald’s condominium in response to a noise complaint. When he partially opened the door to his unit, it appeared that he may have been holding a weapon behind his leg. After he refused to reveal what was behind his leg, the police pushed the door open further. Importantly, Mr. MacDonald was not under arrest. He therefore retained a strong expectation of privacy in his home and the police required heightened grounds to justify entry — i.e., a reasonable belief in imminent harm. In the present case, by contrast, the police had already entered the home under exigent circumstances and lawfully effected the arrest. Mr. Stairs’ expectation of privacy was thus significantly diminished (Fearon, at para. 56, referencing R. v. Beare, 1988 CanLII 126 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 387, at p. 413). To be clear, “[t]he authority for the search does not arise as a result of a reduced expectation of privacy of the arrested individual”; however, it is a factor in assessing the standard for a search incident to arrest (Caslake, at para. 17). It follows, in our view, that MacDonald is distinguishable.

[77]                        There are also independent reasons for rejecting a standard of reasonable belief in imminent harm for a home search incident to arrest. First, because a search incident to arrest typically occurs at the early stages of an investigation, the police will often be unable to show reasonable and probable grounds. Setting the bar too high will prevent the police from acting promptly, taking immediate steps to address risks to their safety and the safety of others, including innocent bystanders. Second, an imminence requirement would practically proscribe the search incident to arrest power, as it would simply restate the exigency exception. If there were exigent circumstances, the police could act solely on that basis. There would be no need for the power to search incident to arrest.

(b)         Nature and Extent of the Search

[78]                        The police must carefully tailor their searches incident to arrest in a home to ensure that they respect the heightened privacy interests implicated. The search incident to arrest power does not permit the police to engage in windfall searches. The police are highly constrained when they go beyond the area within the physical control of the arrested person.

[79]                        The search incident to arrest power only permits police to search the surrounding area of the arrest (Cloutier, at pp. 180‑81; Coughlan, at p. 124). This Court’s guidance on how to determine what constitutes the surrounding area of the arrest remains constant. As indicated, the key consideration is the link between the location and purpose of the search and the grounds for the arrest (Nolet, at para. 49).

[80]                        In addition, the nature of the search must be tailored to its specific purpose, the circumstances of the arrest, and the nature of the offence. As a general rule, the police cannot use the search incident to arrest power to justify searching every nook and cranny of the house. A search incident to arrest remains an exception to the general rule that a warrant is required to justify intrusion into the home. The search should be no more intrusive than is necessary to resolve the police’s reasonable suspicion.

[81]                        Further, it would be good practice for the police to take detailed notes after searching a home incident to arrest. They should keep track of the places searched, the extent of the search, the time of the search, its purpose, and its duration. In some instances, insufficient notes may lead a trial judge to make adverse findings impacting the reasonableness of the search.

(4)         The Applicable Framework

[82]                        In summary, a search of a home incident to arrest for safety purposes will comply with s. 8 of the Charter when the following requirements are met:

(1)         The arrest was lawful.

(2)         The search was incident to the arrest. The search will be incident to arrest when the following considerations are met:

(a)   Where the area searched is within the arrested person’s physical control at the time of the arrest, the common law standard must be satisfied.

(b)   Where the area searched is outside the arrested person’s physical control at the time of the arrest — but the area is sufficiently proximate to the arrest — the police must have reason to suspect that the search will further the objective of police and public safety, including the safety of the accused.

(3)         Where the area searched is outside the arrested person’s physical control at the time of the arrest — but the area is sufficiently proximate to the arrest — the nature and the extent of the search must be tailored to the purpose of the search and the heightened privacy interests in a home.

VI.         Application

[83]                        Before this Court, Mr. Stairs does not question the lawfulness of his arrest or the validity of the initial pat-down search and scan of the laundry room. The outstanding issues are (a) whether the police had a reason to suspect that there were safety risks which justified the basement living room search; and (b) whether the search was conducted in a reasonable manner.

A.           Reasonable Suspicion

[84]                        The living room search met the standard for reasonable suspicion, both in terms of its subjective and objective components.

(1)         Subjective Component

[85]                        It was open to the trial judge to conclude that the police subjectively believed there was a safety risk that would be addressed by conducting a clearing search of the living room. This was a valid law enforcement purpose. The officer who conducted the clearing search (Officer Vandervelde) testified that the search was performed to ensure that “no one else was there”, such as someone potentially posing a risk or needing assistance, and that there were “no other hazards”, such as weapons or firearms sitting out in the open (see pre-trial application reasons, at para. 282).

(2)         Objective Component

[86]                        It was equally open to the trial judge to find that it was objectively reasonable for the police to clear the area for hazards and other occupants. When assessing reasonableness, it is essential to properly contextualize the arrest and the surrounding circumstances. Here, the following factors figure prominently in the reason-to-suspect analysis: (a) the dynamic before and during the arrest; and (b) the nature of the offence for which Mr. Stairs was arrested.

(a)           The Dynamic of the Arrest

[87]                        The situation was volatile and rapidly changing. The police were responding to a civilian 9‑1‑1 call. The caller reported that the male driver was swerving on the road while repeatedly striking the female passenger in a “flurry of strikes”. He continued hitting her, even though she was huddling to protect herself.

[88]                        Shortly thereafter, the police located the reported car parked in the driveway of an unknown home. Despite loudly and repeatedly announcing themselves, no one answered the door. They entered the home because they feared that the assault was ongoing. When the woman emerged from the living room in the basement, she had fresh injuries to her face, supporting the police officers’ belief that she had been assaulted. Moreover, Mr. Stairs disobeyed repeated commands. He behaved erratically, running across the basement from the living room and barricading himself in the laundry room.

[89]                        From door knock to arrest, about four minutes elapsed. The situation was tense and the police had their weapons drawn. Throughout this interaction, the police also knew that Mr. Stairs had a history of violence, including domestic violence, that he was an escape risk, and that he had been identified as a high‑risk offender.

(b)         The Nature of the Offence

[90]                        The arrest was for domestic assault. As this Court recognized in Godoy, at para. 21, privacy in the home must be balanced with the safety of other members of the household:

One of the hallmarks of [domestic violence] is its private nature. Familial abuse occurs within the supposed sanctity of the home. While there is no question that one’s privacy at home is a value to be preserved and promoted, privacy cannot trump the safety of all members of the household. If our society is to provide an effective means of dealing with domestic violence, it must have a form of crisis response.

[91]                        For victims of domestic violence, the home is often not a safe haven. Instead, it is a place that shields and enables their abuse. While privacy interests in the home are important, s. 8 of the Charter “was not intended to protect blindly privacy interests claimed in the context of criminal activities which are played out within one’s home” (Silveira, at para. 119, per L’Heureux‑Dubé J., concurring). In domestic violence cases, the police are not only concerned with the privacy and autonomy of the person arrested; they must also be alert to the safety of all members of the household, including both known and potential victims.

[92]                        Historically, victims of domestic violence did not receive the help they needed. Domestic conflicts were considered “private” matters that did not warrant state intervention. More recently, “the courts, legislators, police and social service workers have all engaged in a serious and important campaign to educate themselves and the public on the nature and prevalence of domestic violence” (Godoy, at para. 21). And yet, despite these advances, domestic violence persists. It remains one of the most prevalent crimes in Canada, accounting for more than a quarter of all violent crimes. In 2019, there were about 400,000 victims of violent crime reported to the police. Of these, 26 percent — over 100,000 people — were victimized by a family member (Statistics Canada, Family violence in Canada: A statistical profile, 2019 (March 2021), at p. 4).

[93]                        Moreover, cases involving domestic violence are often emotionally charged and volatile (Jensen v. Stemmer, 2007 MBCA 42, 214 Man. R. (2d) 64, at para. 98; L. Ruff, “Does Training Matter? Exploring Police Officer Response to Domestic Dispute Calls Before and After Training on Intimate Partner Violence” (2012), 85 Police J. 285). Domestic dispute calls can be dangerous and even life‑threatening for responding officers and persons at the scene (R. v. Dodd (1999), 1999 CanLII 18930 (NL CA), 180 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 145 (N.L.C.A.), at para. 38). Given the prevalence of domestic violence and its attendant risks, responding police officers must have the ability to assess and control the situation. In this case, that included confirming whether other individuals or hazards were in the surrounding area of the arrest.

[94]                        The police often respond to domestic violence calls with limited information. For example, they may not know if other family members, including children, are involved. This is further exacerbated when victims at the scene of the arrest are uncooperative, a common phenomenon in the domestic violence context. For example, in R. v. Lowes, 2016 ONCA 519, the police responded to a 9‑1‑1 call in which a neighbour reported hearing a man threaten to kill a woman. The woman insisted to the police that no one else was in the apartment. The Court of Appeal found that the police would have been “derelict in their duty” had they accepted the woman’s response at face value (para. 12 (CanLII)).

[95]                        A similar situation played out here. Despite fresh and visible injuries, the victim claimed that she and Mr. Stairs were just play fighting. This was not credible, given the nature of her injuries and since a civilian had witnessed an assault so violent that he reported his observations to 9‑1‑1. Moreover, Officer Brown testified that based on his conversation with the victim, he believed that she “didn’t want to co‑operate” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 49). Importantly, the police could not depend on her for reliable information about the presence of other people, other hazards, or the cause of her injuries, and there was no one else they could turn to for such information. It was thus objectively reasonable for the police to engage in a cursory search of the surrounding area of the arrest, including the basement living room.

[96]                        Our colleague Justice Karakatsanis maintains that the police acted on generalized suspicion, as opposed to reasonable suspicion. With respect, we disagree. In assessing whether the conduct of the police was objectively reasonable in the circumstances of this case, we are reminded of the invaluable insight provided by Doherty J.A. in Golub, at p. 757: in volatile circumstances where the police must expect the unexpected, it is “wrong to ignore the realities of the situations in which police officers must make these decisions”. While it is critical that the line between generalized suspicion and reasonable suspicion be maintained, in cases like the present one, we must assiduously avoid using twenty-twenty hindsight as the yardstick against which to measure instantaneous decisions made by the police.

[97]                        Although privacy interests in the home are important, they are not absolute. On the facts of this case, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that society’s interest in effective law enforcement should prevail over Mr. Stairs’ privacy interest in the basement living room. The trial judge did not err in concluding that it was objectively reasonable for the police to check the area to ensure that no other people (including potential victims) were present and no weapons or hazards were sitting out in the open.

B.            Nature and Extent of the Search

[98]                        The search was conducted reasonably. It took place right after the arrest and the police merely conducted a visual scan of the living room area to ensure that no one else was present and that there were no weapons or hazards.

[99]                        The spatial scope of the search was appropriate. The trial judge’s finding of fact that the living room was part of the surrounding area of the arrest reveals no error. The police appropriately limited the scope of their search. Had they searched the upper floors of the home or other rooms, the search would have been unreasonable. But they did not do so. They only cleared the basement living room area immediately adjacent to where Mr. Stairs had been arrested — the very area from which he and the victim had emerged just moments earlier.

[100]                     Moreover, the police searched what appeared to be a common living room space. There was nothing about that space to suggest that a higher than normal expectation of privacy in the context of a home was warranted, such as one might reasonably expect in a bedroom. While it was revealed at trial that Mr. Stairs used the basement living room area as his main living space, at the time of the search there was no indication that it was being used as a bedroom. Nor was the basement a separate apartment unit from the rest of the house.

[101]                     Finally, the police engaged in the most cursory of searches. They did a brief visual scan to see if anyone else or obvious weapons or hazards were in the area. They did not move any items or open doors or cupboards, which would not have been permissible in this case. Given their objective, the search was the least invasive possible.

[102]                     Counsel for Mr. Stairs submitted that if the applicable standard for a search incident to arrest in a home is modified to require reasonable suspicion, then she took “no issue with the applicability of the plain view doctrine” (transcript, at p. 19). Because this Court did not have the benefit of any submissions on this issue, we leave for another day the important question of whether and how the common law plain view doctrine applies in the context of a search incident to arrest in a home. Given the concession on this record, and the findings of the trial judge, we would not disturb her conclusion that the seizure was authorized.

VII.      Disposition

[103]                     For the reasons set out above, the search of the living room incident to arrest did not violate Mr. Stairs’ s. 8 Charter right against unreasonable search and seizure. The police had reason to suspect that there was a safety risk which would be addressed through a cursory visual clearing search. Moreover, the search was tailored to its purpose — it was targeted, brief, and constrained. The evidence from the living room search was therefore properly admitted at trial. Accordingly, we would dismiss the appeal.

 

The reasons of Karakatsanis, Brown and Martin JJ. were delivered by

 

                    Karakatsanis J. —

I.               Overview

[104]                     Responding to a domestic violence call, police arrested Matthew Stairs in his home, searched his basement, and, in a discovery unrelated either to the nature of the arrest or the aim of the search, seized methamphetamine that was found behind a couch and next to a coffee table. Mr. Stairs was later charged with drug possession for the purpose of trafficking. The majority concludes that the police’s warrantless search and seizures complied with s. 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I disagree.

[105]                     A home is not only shelter — it is a personal refuge and a trove of personal information. It occupies a unique place in s. 8’s protections from unreasonable searches and seizures. Indeed, there is “no place on earth where persons can have a greater expectation of privacy” (R. v. Silveira, 1995 CanLII 89 (SCC), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 297, at para. 140). But privacy is not absolute, and must sometimes yield to competing law enforcement objectives. The question in this case is how to balance the two when police lawfully enter a home without a warrant, make an arrest, and seek to conduct a search incident to that arrest. Does the Charter require that special restrictions apply?

[106]                     The question turns on the application of the common law search incident to arrest doctrine, which ordinarily entitles police to search the person arrested and their immediate surroundings for safety purposes, to preserve evidence from destruction, or to discover evidence that could be used at trial. The power is unusual because, as the authority to search derives from the arrest, it authorizes warrantless searches without the need for reasonable grounds or even reasonable suspicion. Instead, police must only have “some reasonable basis” for the search (R. v. Caslake, 1998 CanLII 838 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 51, at para. 20).

[107]                     Like my colleagues, I conclude that the common law sets too low a bar for searches incident to arrest inside a home. Privacy demands more. When officers seek to search a home for safety purposes — as they did here — the appropriate standard is reasonable suspicion of an imminent threat to police or public safety.

[108]                     Applied to this case, I conclude that the search and seizures were not justified. The police only searched the basement once Mr. Stairs had been handcuffed and the victim had gone upstairs, and absent any sign of weapons or other people. The searching officer gave no basis to ground a reasonable suspicion that anybody’s safety was at risk following Mr. Stairs’ arrest. The search and seizures were therefore unlawful and violated Mr. Stairs’ s. 8 rights. I would exclude the evidence under s. 24(2), set aside Mr. Stairs’ conviction, and enter an acquittal.

II.            Facts

[109]                     Responding to a 9-1-1 call from a civilian who witnessed a driver assaulting his female passenger, Officers Brown, Vandervelde, and Martin found the car at a residential address and ran the licence plate. The car was associated with Matthew Stairs, an individual who carried cautions for escape risk, violence, and family violence. Receiving no answer at the front door, the officers looked through windows and, seeing nobody in the house, entered through an unlocked side door. On the main level, no lights were on, but they could see light and heard music coming from the basement. Officer Vandervelde saw Mr. Stairs run across the bottom of the stairwell and a woman emerged from the basement with her hands up, displaying fresh facial injuries. While Officer Martin attended to the woman upstairs, Officers Brown and Vandervelde entered the basement with weapons drawn and eventually coaxed Mr. Stairs out of the laundry room, where he had barricaded himself. Officer Brown arrested and searched him, finding only money on his person. Officer Vandervelde then did a “sweep” of the basement and, about 10 feet from the arrest, saw a transparent Tupperware container on the floor behind a couch, containing what looked like crystal methamphetamine. A ziplock bag next to a coffee table also appeared to contain methamphetamine. Police seized both items and also arrested the injured woman for drug possession.

[110]                     Mr. Stairs was charged with possession of a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking, and challenged the admissibility of the drugs under s. 8 of the Charter. The trial judge dismissed his application, holding that police had lawfully arrested him, lawfully searched incident to arrest, and lawfully seized the evidence under the plain view doctrine (2018 ONSC 3747, 412 C.R.R. (2d) 95 (pre-trial application reasons)). A majority at the Ontario Court of Appeal agreed, holding that the search was authorized as a search incident to arrest, and the seizures of evidence were lawful under the plain view doctrine (2020 ONCA 678, 153 O.R. (3d) 32). Justice Nordheimer, dissenting, would have held that the search failed to satisfy the standard of “objectively verifiable necessity” for a warrantless search of a home (R. v. MacDonald, 2014 SCC 3, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 37, at para. 31). Mr. Stairs appeals to this Court as of right.

III.         Analysis

[111]                     My reasons proceed in three parts. First, I consider the search incident to arrest power, and conclude that it authorizes a search where the officer reasonably suspects an imminent threat to police or public safety. Second, I consider the application of that standard to the evidence of this case, and conclude that the search and seizures were unlawful, and thus unconstitutional. Lastly, I consider s. 24(2) of the Charter and conclude that the evidence should be excluded and the appeal allowed.

A.           The Power to Search Incident to Arrest

(1)         Section 8 of the Charter

[112]                     Section 8 of the Charter confers the right “to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure”. A search or seizure is only reasonable, and thus constitutional, when (1) it is authorized by law; (2) the law itself is reasonable; and (3) the search or seizure was carried out reasonably (R. v. Collins, 1987 CanLII 84 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 278). The scope of the right is determined by the underlying balance s. 8 strikes between privacy interests and legitimate law enforcement objectives (Hunter v. Southam Inc., 1984 CanLII 33 (SCC), [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at pp. 159-60).

[113]                     Like other Charter rights, s. 8 is a restraint on state power; it “is not in itself an authorization for governmental action” (Hunter, at p. 156). In Hunter, the Court held that prior judicial authorization — a warrant — is a precondition to a valid search or seizure, failing which the search or seizure would be presumptively unconstitutional (p. 161). In entrusting the authorization to search to a judicial arbiter on a standard of reasonable and probable grounds, the warrant requirement “puts the onus on the state to demonstrate the superiority of its interest to that of the individual” and serves as a “means of preventing unjustified searches before they happen” (Hunter, at p. 160 (emphasis in original)).

[114]                     The warrant requirement is a foundational check on police powers, and a cornerstone of our constitutional order. Any exceptions should be “exceedingly rare” (R. v. Simmons, 1988 CanLII 12 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 495, at p. 527; R. v. Grant, 1993 CanLII 68 (SCC), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 223, at p. 239). Still, obtaining a warrant is not always feasible. In exigent circumstances — often defined as an imminent threat to police or public safety, or a risk of the imminent loss or destruction of evidence — the police may be authorized to search or seize evidence without one (Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 487.11; R. v. Feeney, 1997 CanLII 342 (SCC), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 13, at para. 52). Such exceptions are justified not by diminished privacy interests, but by the pressing law enforcement objectives that overtake them when critical situations arise.

(2)         Common Law Power to Search Incident to Arrest

[115]                     The police power to search incident to arrest is another common law exception to the warrant requirement. It is available where (1) the individual has been lawfully arrested; (2) the search is “truly incidental to the arrest in the sense that it is for a valid law enforcement purpose related to the reasons for the arrest”; and (3) the search is conducted reasonably (R. v. Saeed, 2016 SCC 24, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 518, at para. 37). Its authority derives from the arrest itself; there is no independent need for reasonable and probable grounds (Caslake, at para. 13).

[116]                     The power is not unbounded. It only allows police to search the arrestee’s person and “to seize anything in his or her possession or immediate surroundings” (Cloutier v. Langlois, 1990 CanLII 122 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 158, at p. 180). And the “truly incidental to arrest” criterion requires two things. First, the search must relate to a valid law enforcement objective — protecting police or public safety, protecting evidence from destruction, or discovering evidence which could be used at trial — and must be subjectively and objectively reasonable in the circumstances (Caslake, at paras. 19 and 21). Second, the search must remain proximate in space and time to the arrest (Caslake, at para. 25). It is, in short, a “focussed power”, whose scope turns on the “particular circumstances of the particular arrest” (R. v. Fearon, 2014 SCC 77, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 621, at paras. 13 and 16). The objectives and scope of the search will depend on the nature of the offence and the circumstances of the arrest (Caslake, at para. 25).

[117]                     Notwithstanding the power’s limitations, the Court has remained cautious to prevent its overreach. The search incident to arrest power is an “extraordinary” one, not only because it permits warrantless searches, but because it may do so “in circumstances in which the grounds to obtain a warrant do not exist” (Fearon, at para. 16). In some cases, the Court has modified or tailored the common law framework to account for particularly compelling individual interests, restricting seizures of hair, buccal swabs, and teeth impressions (R. v. Stillman, 1997 CanLII 384 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 607); strip searches (R. v. Golden, 2001 SCC 83, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 679); cell phone searches (Fearon); and penile swabs (Saeed). The issue in this case is whether the strong privacy interests in a home also call for modifications to the exercise of this common law power.

(3)         Searches in a Home

[118]                     To answer that question, s. 8 requires that the privacy interests in a home and law enforcement interests be balanced.

(a)           Privacy Interests

[119]                     For centuries, the law has recognized that every person’s home is their sanctuary (Eccles v. Bourque, 1974 CanLII 191 (SCC), [1975] 2 S.C.R. 739, at p. 743). Long a central restraint on state intrusions, the legal status of privacy in one’s home “significantly increased in importance with the advent of the Charter” (Feeney, at para. 43). Today, there is no doubt that individuals have strong privacy interests in a home (Silveira, at para. 140; Feeney, at para. 43; R. v. Godoy, 1999 CanLII 709 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 311, at para. 19; R. v. Tessling, 2004 SCC 67, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 432, at para. 22; MacDonald, at para. 26; R. v. Paterson, 2017 SCC 15, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 202, at para. 46; R. v. Reeves, 2018 SCC 56, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 531, at para. 24). And this is true not only of arrested persons, but of other occupants, including in areas or items under shared control (Reeves, at para. 37). However brief or circumscribed, police searches in homes threaten those compelling and comprehensive privacy interests and the interests that underlie them — dignity, integrity and autonomy (R. v. Plant, 1993 CanLII 70 (SCC), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 281, at p. 293) — all of which are vital to human flourishing.

[120]                     My colleagues recognize that the privacy interests in a home are high (para. 49). But unlike them, I find it unhelpful to compare privacy in a home to a strip search or obtaining bodily samples (para. 51). Privacy interests come in different forms — whether personal, territorial, or informational (Tessling, at para. 20) — which are not easily equated. The focus in tailoring the common law framework is to reconcile the specific privacy interests at issue with the specific law enforcement interests that counterbalance them. Whether a search of a home could be more or less invasive than body, cellphone or car searches is, in this respect, tangential; the key questions are when and how the undoubtedly strong privacy interests in a home ought to yield to varying policing objectives.

[121]                     Put simply, a home is the setting of individuals’ innermost lives: at once a shield from the outside world and a biographical record, its sanctity is indispensable. Without it, personal privacy, dignity, integrity and autonomy would suffer. The high weight placed on a person’s security in their home, then, stands as a “bulwark” of protection, which “affords the individual a measure of privacy and tranquillity against the overwhelming power of the state” (Silveira, at para. 41, per La Forest J., dissenting, but not on this point).

(b)         Law Enforcement Objectives

[122]                     While privacy interests in a home are significant, so too are the interests in protecting police and public safety. Police must be able to address the hazards that may arise in unfamiliar, and potentially hostile, environments, not least when investigating volatile offences like domestic violence. The cost of inadequate measures to protect safety “can be very high indeed”, and it would be unreasonable to “ask the police to place themselves in potentially dangerous situations” without equipping them to take reasonable defensive steps (R. v. Golub (1997), 1997 CanLII 6316 (ON CA), 34 O.R. (3d) 743 (C.A.), at p. 757). Depending on the circumstances of the arrest, police may also need to assist others on the scene, including children.

[123]                     To be sure, the law enforcement interests engaged by home searches in the domestic violence context may cut both ways. Police searches may revictimize victims or uncover evidence of unrelated offences, which may discourage individuals from reporting. That is a particular concern in domestic violence, one of whose “hallmarks” is its private nature (Godoy, at para. 21). Again, this case is illustrative: shortly after arresting Mr. Stairs, police arrested the victim herself for drug possession. Victims of domestic violence are often reluctant to seek police assistance and reluctant to cooperate when police arrive. Overly broad search powers can only compound that reluctance.

[124]                     Still, both sides of the scale carry significant weight when police encounter safety concerns in a home. While the nature of privacy interests in a private home usually justifies a higher threshold, safety concerns pull strongly in the other direction. Clearly, a right to search on a “reasonable basis” alone would give little effect to the powerful privacy interest. Yet a search power couched in undue restrictions could imperil police or the public. Balancing the two objectives under s. 8, I agree that reasonable suspicion is an appropriate standard for searches based on safety, where police believe there may be an imminent threat to the police or others.

[125]                     In reaching this conclusion, it follows that I would reject the submissions of Mr. Stairs, and the conclusion of the dissenting justice below (at paras. 76-78) that s. 8 requires a standard of reasonable belief in imminent harm in this context. But although I agree with my colleagues that reasonable belief — that is, reasonable and probable grounds (Baron v. Canada, 1993 CanLII 154 (SCC), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 416, at pp. 446-47) — sets too high a bar, I do not agree that the requirement that a safety risk be imminent should be rejected (Moldaver and Jamal JJ.’s reasons, para. 77). The safety risks that arise from an arrest in a home, for which a warrant cannot feasibly be procured, will generally be imminent. While this requirement may indeed overlap or “restate the exigency exception” (para. 77), consistency with other legal standards is not a reason to define this one more expansively. Imminence is a useful concept because it defines those circumstances where obtaining a warrant is not feasible. It signals that if police can get a warrant before searching a home, they should do so.

(c)           Summary

[126]                     In sum, the strong privacy interests in a home call for modifying the common law standard for search incident to arrest when the arrest occurs in a home. That balance is best struck by authorizing police to conduct a search incident to arrest when they reasonably suspect there is an imminent threat to the safety of police or the public. As it was not argued, I would leave for another day the question of whether searches for evidence inside a home incident to arrest are permissible under s. 8.

(4)         The Reasonable Suspicion Standard

[127]                     I agree with my colleagues’ overview of the reasonable suspicion standard. Some points, however, warrant emphasis.

[128]                     While reasonable suspicion is a relatively low threshold imposed by the courts to meet s. 8 of the Charter, it still requires the officers to articulate some basis to suspect safety may be at risk. As in other searches incident to arrest, they must have both subjective and objective grounds for the search (Caslake, at para. 21). And those grounds must correspond — officers “cannot rely on the fact that, objectively, a legitimate purpose for the search existed when that is not the purpose for which they searched” (Caslake, at para. 27). The court’s task is to examine the evidence of the actual reasons for the search — and not whether reasonable suspicion could have justified the search.

[129]                     In R. v. Chehil, 2013 SCC 49, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 220, the Court outlined several principles to guide the reasonable suspicion standard’s application. As my colleagues note, reasonable suspicion:

•         is “based on objectively discernible facts, which can then be subjected to independent judicial scrutiny [that] is exacting, and must account for the totality of the circumstances” (Chehil, at para. 26);

•         is a higher standard than “mere suspicion” but lower than reasonable and probable grounds — it engages “reasonable possibility, rather than probability” (paras. 26-27, citing R. v. Kang-Brown, 2008 SCC 18, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 456, at para. 75); and

•         is “fact-based, flexible, and grounded in common sense and practical, everyday experience” (para. 29).

[130]                     My colleagues also explain that reasonable suspicion does not permit searches “based on generalized concerns arising from the arrest” (para. 67). Indeed, in Chehil the Court was clear that an “exacting” review of the basis for a search must be tied to the specific facts in question. Citing the need for “a sufficiently particularized constellation of factors”, the Court explained that a “constellation of factors will not be sufficient to ground reasonable suspicion where it amounts merely to a ‘generalized’ suspicion” (para. 30). And while recognizing the importance of officer training and experience in the assessment, it cautioned against allowing those factors to overwhelm the inquiry:

An officer’s training and experience may provide an objective experiential, as opposed to empirical, basis for grounding reasonable suspicion. However, this is not to say that hunches or intuition grounded in an officer’s experience will suffice, or that deference is owed to a police officer’s view of the circumstances based on her training or experience in the field . . . . A police officer’s educated guess must not supplant the rigorous and independent scrutiny demanded by the reasonable suspicion standard. [Emphasis added; citation omitted; para. 47.]

[131]                     I agree with my colleagues that the factors enumerated in Golub in the context of a safety search — including the “nature of the apprehended risk, the potential consequences of not taking protective measures, the availability of alternative measures, and the likelihood of the contemplated danger actually existing” (Golub, at p. 758) — are a helpful guide to assessing when a risk will give rise to reasonable suspicion. Ultimately, the task for the courts is, in each case, to apply the standard in light of the specific evidence before them, focusing on the reasons actually relied on by the officer. When the police lack a sufficient justification for a search, it is not the role of the Crown or the judge to supply one after the fact. The issue is whether the search was constitutional at the time it was carried out.

(5)         The Scope of Safety Searches Inside a Home

[132]                     Alongside the reasonable suspicion standard, the permissible scope of a search serves as another limitation on the police’s ability to conduct a search incident to arrest inside a home. This constrains searches in two ways: by the nature of the concerns animating the arrest, and by the need for temporal and spatial proximity between the search and the arrest.

[133]                     Just as the authority for a search incident to arrest derives from the arrest itself, a “search is only justifiable if the purpose of the search is related to the purpose of the arrest” (Caslake, at para. 17; see also para. 13). An arrest that only gives rise to safety concerns cannot, without more, authorize a search for matters unrelated to safety — in an arrest for traffic violations, for instance, “once the police have ensured their own safety, there is nothing that could properly justify searching any further” (Caslake, at para. 22). Similarly, a warrantless arrest in a home that leads officers to reasonably suspect a need to neutralize threats, or to locate and assist victims, only allows them to conduct a search consistent with those particular concerns. There must be a purposive link to the nature of the arrest.

[134]                     A search that falls within those parameters must also be spatially and temporally proximate to the arrest. An arrest cannot lead the police too far afield. Spatially, this Court has said the items or places searched must fall within the “immediate surroundings” of the arrest (Cloutier, at p. 180). And although this Court has resisted setting “strict limit[s] on the amount of time that can elapse between the time of search and the time of arrest”, police must, depending on the facts, conduct the search “within a reasonable period of time after the arrest” (Caslake, at paras. 16 and 24). Obviously, these limits are particularly important in a home.

[135]                     I would not adopt, as my colleagues do, the American distinction between “areas inside and outside the arrested person’s physical control” (paras. 62-64). In our jurisprudence a search incident to arrest has always been framed as the authority to search the person arrested and their immediate surroundings. In defining where the modified framework applies inside a home, I would distinguish between the arrestee’s person and their immediate surroundings. This is because a search of an arrestee’s person (the ubiquitous “frisk” search) does not implicate their privacy interests in the home — they have the same personal privacy interests at home as in public. Areas beyond their person, however, engage broader territorial and informational interests which, in a home, are significant. The distinction based on a zone inside the arrested person’s control was not argued, its adoption is unnecessary, and it complicates the search incident to arrest framework.

[136]                     In rare situations where safety concerns arise independently from the arrest, other doctrines may also apply. The common law police duty to protect life and safety, for instance, may justify police in carrying out a warrantless safety search in circumstances of “objectively verifiable necessity” (MacDonald, at paras. 40-41). But those searches, too, cannot be “unbridled” (para. 41). They too must be conducted in a manner that reflects their purpose, namely to do what is “reasonably necessary” to allay the apprehended threat (para. 47 (emphasis in original)).

[137]                     Clearly, not all safety concerns are alike. As with determining whether the reasonable suspicion standard has been satisfied, the scope of a search will depend on a particularized assessment of the facts before the police. But given that searches incident to arrest inside a home require an imminent safety risk, their scope will, in my view, often be limited. This is consistent with the power’s exceptional status under s. 8. Though “an invaluable tool in the hands of the police”, searches incident to arrest “inevitably intrude on an individual’s privacy interests” (Saeed, at para. 1). They should intrude no more than necessary. In a home more than anywhere else, it ought to remain a “focussed power” (Fearon, at para. 16).

B.            Application

[138]                     Applied to this case, I conclude that the search and the seizures fell outside the scope of the common law police powers and were therefore unconstitutional.

[139]                     Officer Vandervelde, the officer who discovered the drugs, searched Mr. Stairs’ basement to identify hazards or other people — that is, for safety. There is thus no dispute that police had “one of the purposes for a valid search incident to arrest in mind when the search [was] conducted” (Caslake, at para. 19). The question is whether the search — which turned up evidence that was unrelated to the reasons for the arrest or the nature of the search — was subjectively and objectively reasonable on the standard of reasonable suspicion.

[140]                     The trial judge’s reasoning on this point was brief. Applying the unmodified common law search incident to arrest framework, she concluded that the search was both subjectively and objectively reasonable:

The search had a valid objective. Vandervelde testified that he searched to make sure no one else was there and that there were no other hazards. This is reasonable. Both the male and the female had come from the living room area. Neither Brown nor Vandervelde could see fully into the living room as they descended the stairs. The quick sweep as they descended the stairs did not fully address safety concerns. As set out above, there were parts of the living room they could not see. [para. 282]

[141]                     The majority at the Court of Appeal reached the same conclusions:

In the end, the police were able to articulate why they had safety concerns. That articulation made sense. They had descended into a basement where they had never been before, in a house they had never been in before. While the 9-1-1 caller said that there were two people in the car that he observed, that did not mean there were only two people in the home. Nor did it mean that there were no other safety concerns hiding around corners.

 

In particular, the police could not see behind the sofa from the doorway to the living room. It was not unreasonable to take a quick visual scan of the room in the circumstances. They had a person in handcuffs and needed to ascend the stairs, which were located right beside the living room, to safely get him out of the residence, all while the female remained on the first floor. The fact that the methamphetamine was sitting out in plain view meant that it could be seized. [paras. 67-68]

[142]                     My colleagues find that it was “open to the trial judge to conclude that the police subjectively believed there was a safety risk”, since the officers testified they searched to ensure no other people or hazards were present (para. 85). And they explain that the search was objectively reasonable for two main reasons. First, the dynamic before and during the arrest was “volatile and rapidly changing” (para. 87). The police entered the home fearing the assault was ongoing, encountered the victim with “fresh injuries to her face” (para. 88) and entered the basement with weapons drawn (para. 89). Meanwhile, Mr. Stairs — who police knew had a history of violence — disobeyed police commands and “barricad[ed] himself in the laundry room” (para. 88). Second, police arrested Mr. Stairs for domestic violence, an offence whose private nature can, perversely, turn the privacy in a home to the abuser’s advantage (para. 91). Its prevalence, the safety risks it poses, and the factual uncertainties at the scene, mean police “must have the ability to assess and control the situation” (para. 93). Police could not rely on the victim, who denied an assault had occurred and was reluctant to cooperate. Taken together, “it was open to the trial judge to conclude that society’s interest in effective law enforcement should prevail over Mr. Stairs’ privacy interest in the basement living room” (para. 97).

[143]                     I cannot agree with this analysis.

[144]                     As I have explained, courts assessing the reasonableness of a police search must determine whether the officer’s own grounds for the search were reasonable. Only those subjective grounds may be considered; courts “cannot rely on the fact that, objectively, a legitimate purpose for the search existed when that is not the purpose for which they searched” (Caslake, at para. 27).

[145]                     The subjective basis for the officers’ search must be found in the evidence of the officer conducting the search. Officer Vandervelde testified as follows when asked what happened after Mr. Stairs’ arrest:

. . . so once he was in handcuffs and I felt it was safe, I proceeded through the basement, make sure there’s no other obvious threats, any other people in that basement.

 

. . .

 

Never really know exactly what you’re looking for when you’re entering a house in a situation like this, so whether there’s firearms sitting out, like I said, other people that could be in the basement. [Emphasis added.]

 

(A.R., vol. II, at pp. 212-13)

[146]                     He later expanded on this answer:

Q.              . . . So in terms of clearing the basement, as opposed to getting a search warrant what is the importance or significance of having to go through that clearing process?

 

A.             Mostly just to ensure my safety and other officers’ safety that are on the scene.

 

Q.             What sort of risks are presented if you don’t clear an area?

 

A.             Other persons could be hiding in the basement; potential unsafely stored firearms or weapons, et cetera, you never really know what kind of hazards could be down there. [Underlining added.]

 

(A.R., vol. II, at p. 229)

[147]                     As I have explained, to satisfy the reasonable suspicion standard, the evidence must be “sufficiently particularized”; the search cannot rest on generalities, hunches, intuition or educated guesses (Chehil, at paras. 30 and 47). But here the officer, at best, expressed a generalized concern about weapons or people that might be found “in a situation like this”. He admitted he “felt it was safe” and you “[n]ever really know exactly what you’re looking for”. His evidence gave no basis to suggest he suspected that other assailants, victims, or weapons were present. As a rationale, “you never really know” could apply any time the police make an arrest in a home. It is not a constitutionally acceptable reason to search in a private home; subjectively, the reasonable suspicion standard was not met.

[148]                     Nor was this subjective justification objectively reasonable. I note the following:

•                  Although the search of Mr. Stairs’ licence plate generated cautions for violence and family violence, there was no mention of weapons in the police dispatch, and nothing to suggest Mr. Stairs possessed any (pre-trial application reasons, at paras. 36, 76, 101 and 157).

•                  Officers Brown and Vandervelde visually scanned the basement when they entered. Although they could not see the entire area, that scan satisfied them that they could turn their backs and focus on drawing Mr. Stairs out from the laundry room (paras. 58, 128 and 281).

•                  Officer Brown found no weapons on Mr. Stairs (at para. 60) and had “no observations from the scene that anyone was in danger” (para. 50).

•                     Officer Vandervelde only conducted the search “once [Mr. Stairs] was in handcuffs and [he] felt safe”, at a time when the victim was upstairs and in the company of Officer Martin (para. 89).

•                     Although the officers knew that Mr. Stairs’ father lived at the home, they never saw any signs of people aside from Mr. Stairs and the victim, and never asked either of them whether anyone else was present (paras. 55, 71, 81-84, 119 and 166‑67).

[149]                     There were, in sum, no particularized facts to justify a safety search, only generalized uncertainty about the presence of weapons or other people. But with Mr. Stairs in handcuffs, the victim upstairs with Officer Martin, and no sign of weapons or other people, there was, quite simply, no apparent safety threat. That is not objectively reasonable suspicion.

[150]                     As the search was neither subjectively nor objectively reasonable, I conclude it was unlawful.

[151]                     Given that conclusion, there is no need to consider whether the seizures of the drugs were justified under the plain view doctrine. The question of whether and how the plain view doctrine applies inside a home has twice been raised, but not addressed, by this Court (Godoy, at para. 22; Reeves, at para. 25). Since the point was not argued before us, I would decline to do so here.

[152]                     As a result, I conclude the search and the seizures of the evidence infringed Mr. Stairs’ s. 8 rights.

C.            Section 24(2) and Disposition

[153]                     The question becomes whether the evidence ought to be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter, in that its admission “would bring the administration of justice into disrepute”. Three lines of inquiry guide the analysis: (1) the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct; (2) the impact of the breach on the Charter-protected interests of the accused; and (3) society’s interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits (R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353 (Grant (2009)), at para. 71).

[154]                     As I would reach a different conclusion on the existence of a Charter violation, no deference is owed to the trial judge’s alternative conclusions on this point (R. v. Le, 2019 SCC 34, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 692, at para. 138).

[155]                     First, the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct is assessed along a spectrum of culpability running from “inadvertent or minor violations” to “wilful or reckless disregard of Charter rights” (Grant (2009), at para. 74; see also Le, at para. 143). In my view, the state conduct in this case falls on the higher end of that spectrum. It was well known that private homes attract a high privacy interest and generally cannot be searched without a warrant. To be sure, the officers cannot be faulted for not applying the legal framework adopted in this appeal, of which they had no notice. But that does not excuse their conduct, given the longstanding importance the law has accorded to privacy in this context. In searching Mr. Stairs’ basement without reasonable justification, the searching officer disregarded his strong privacy interest. And contrary to the trial judge’s finding (pre-trial application reasons, at para. 292), he cannot be taken to have acted in good faith, since he did not act “consistent[ly] with what [he] subjectively, reasonably, and non-negligently believe[d] to be the law” (Le, at para. 147). In the circumstances, this inquiry favours exclusion.

[156]                     Second, since his privacy interests inside his home were significant, the unlawful search and seizures were a major incursion on Mr. Stairs’ Charter-protected interests. This inquiry strongly favours exclusion.

[157]                     Lastly, the drugs were highly reliable evidence that was central to the Crown’s case. The third inquiry pulls strongly in favour of inclusion.

[158]                     When the first two inquiries together make a strong case for exclusion, “the third inquiry will seldom if ever tip the balance in favour of admissibility” (Le, at para. 142). Weighing all three, I conclude that admitting the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. I would find the evidence inadmissible. I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside Mr. Stairs’ conviction for possession of a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking, and enter an acquittal.

 

The following are the reasons delivered by

 

                    Côté J. —

I.               Overview

[159]                     There is agreement with my colleague Karakatsanis J. on the reasonable suspicion standard for searches incidental to arrest inside a home. I also agree with her application of this standard to the facts of this case. I, too, conclude that the search and seizure of the evidence infringed Mr. Stairs’ rights pursuant to s. 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

[160]                     However, I must respectfully part ways with my colleague on the proper disposition of the appeal under s. 24(2) of the Charter. As I will explain, I would not exclude the unlawfully seized evidence. In the exceptional circumstances of this case, I would adopt the trial judge’s alternative conclusion that admitting the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

II.            Section 24(2) Analysis

[161]                     I note at the outset that the trial judge found no breach, and thus her s. 24(2) analysis was conducted in the alternative. In this scenario, while the trial judge’s conclusion is not entitled to deference on appeal, her findings of fact related to s. 24(2) are (R. v. Fearon, 2014 SCC 77, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 621, at para. 90; R. v. Pileggi, 2021 ONCA 4, 153 O.R. (3d) 561, at para. 97; R. v. Kelsy, 2011 ONCA 605, 280 C.C.C. (3d) 456, at para. 60, per Rosenberg J.A.). In any event, and according due deference to the trial judge’s factual findings, I reach the same conclusion. I would decline to exclude the drug evidence seized as a result of the unlawful search.

A.           Seriousness of the Charter‑Infringing Police Conduct

[162]                     Although I have reservations about the officers’ conduct in this case, I conclude that the first factor set out in R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, favours admission.

[163]                     As my colleague Karakatsanis J. reaffirmed in R. v. Saeed, 2016 SCC 24, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 518, at para. 126 (concurring in the result), “where the police act on a mistaken understanding of the law where the law is unsettled, their Charter‑infringing conduct is considered to be less serious” (citing R. v. Cole, 2012 SCC 53, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 34, at paras. 86-87; R. v. Vu, 2013 SCC 60, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 657, at paras. 69 and 71; see also R. v. Spencer, 2014 SCC 43, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 212, at para. 77; Fearon, at para. 93; S. C. Hill, D. M. Tanovich and L. P. Strezos, McWilliams’ Canadian Criminal Evidence (5th ed. (loose‑leaf)), at §19:40).

[164]                     I therefore accept the Crown’s submission that the seriousness of the infringement in this case is attenuated by the uncertainty of the law regarding residential searches incident to arrest at the relevant time. Indeed, it appears this is the first time this Court has considered the search incident to arrest power applied inside a home. Disagreement among the members of this Court and those of the Court of Appeal on the proper standard for and permissible scope of post‑arrest residential safety searches illustrates the legal grey area in which police were operating. If a dozen distinguished jurists cannot agree on the applicable law, how can we expect these officers to have understood and properly applied it on the fly? In my respectful view, as in Vu, at para. 71, “[g]iven the uncertainty in the law at the time and the otherwise reasonable manner in which the search was carried out”, the seriousness of the police misconduct in this case was at the lowest end of the spectrum.

[165]                     I would add that the trial judge in this case found as a fact that the police acted in “good faith” at all times during this “dynamic” arrest and search, believing their conduct was authorized by law (2018 ONSC 3747, 412 C.R.R. (2d) 95 (“pre‑trial application reasons”), at para. 292). As in Vu, the cogent analysis of my colleagues on the applicable standard in this case “should serve to clarify the law” and “prevent this kind of confusion in the future” (para. 69).

[166]                     That said, I acknowledge the difficulties with Officer Vandervelde’s evidence, as highlighted by the dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal (2020 ONCA 678, 153 O.R. (3d) 32, at para. 100). But I do not see a sufficient evidentiary basis on which to interfere with the trial judge’s factual finding of good faith. I see nothing to suggest any systemic concerns regarding the police conduct in this case. Further, I agree with the trial judge that there is “no evidence of a blatant or callous disregard of the Charter rights by any of the three officers” (pre‑trial application reasons, at para. 292). In my view, the unlawful search and seizure was the result of an honest one‑off mistake, albeit one with serious implications for Mr. Stairs’ right to privacy.

B.            Impact on Mr. Stairs’ Charter Right to Privacy

[167]                     I would accept the Crown’s concession that the second Grant factor favours exclusion.

[168]                     As the trial judge recognized, an unlawful warrantless residential search violates privacy interests which lie at the very core of s. 8. I agree with my colleague Karakatsanis J. that the sanctity of one’s home is an indispensable component of personal privacy (para. 121).

[169]                     The police conduct in this case therefore had a serious impact on Mr. Stairs’ Charter-protected privacy interests.

C.            Society’s Interest in Adjudication on the Merits

[170]                     Mr. Stairs fairly concedes that the third Grant factor “favours the admission of the evidence” (A.F., at para. 86). I would accept this concession.

[171]                     I wish to underscore the fact that the police seized over 90 grams of crystal methamphetamine. This evidence is plainly reliable and, without it, the Crown would have no case on Mr. Stairs’ charge for possession for the purpose of trafficking. The sentence for this charge represented 20 months of Mr. Stairs’ global 26‑month sentence. I agree with the Crown that there is a significant public interest in an adjudication of the drug charge on its merits.

D.           Final Balancing

[172]                     Balancing the three lines of inquiry above, I would decline to exclude the evidence under s. 24(2).

[173]                     Going forward, with the benefit of this Court’s guidance, it will be very difficult for police to justify admission in a similar scenario to the one at bar. The modifications to the law my colleagues outline will require police to respect individual privacy rights within a home, by refraining from warrantless searches unless they reasonably suspect a search is necessary to address a safety risk. Where no such risk exists which meets the requisite threshold, the arrestee’s s. 8 privacy interests should generally prevail. In other words, police should secure the home and obtain a search warrant, which is not a particularly onerous task.

[174]                     However, in the present case, I would not interfere with the trial judge’s finding that the police were acting in good faith on their understanding of unsettled law. As I have explained, the justificatory standard for and permissible scope of a residential search incident to arrest were unclear at the relevant time. Further, society has a strong interest in the adjudication of a charge involving a large quantity of a highly dangerous and pernicious street drug.

[175]                     Accordingly, I would adopt the trial judge’s alternative conclusion that the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

III.         Disposition

[176]                     For the foregoing reasons, I would decline to exclude the evidence seized in violation of Mr. Stairs’ s. 8 rights.

[177]                     In the result, I would dismiss the appeal and affirm the conviction.

 

                    Appeal dismissed, Karakatsanis, Brown and Martin JJ. dissenting.

                    Jamal J. —

I.               Introduction

[1]                             At issue on this appeal is whether the arrest of an individual based on a mistake of law and subsequent searches infringed the individual’s rights against arbitrary detention (s. 9) and unreasonable search and seizure (s. 8) guaranteed under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and if so, whether the evidence obtained should be excluded under s. 24(2).

[2]                             The police investigated the appellant, Mr. Sokha Tim, for a traffic collision after he hit a roadside sign on a busy road in Calgary and kept driving until his car stopped. An officer found the appellant standing on the roadside by his damaged car and asked him for his driver’s licence, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. When the appellant returned to his car to get these documents, the officer saw him try to hide a yellow pill that the officer correctly identified as gabapentin, a prescription drug that the officer mistakenly believed was a controlled substance under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19 (“CDSA”). The officer then arrested him for possession of a controlled substance. The police conducted a pat-down search of the appellant and searched his car incident to arrest, finding fentanyl, other illegal drugs, and ammunition. Because the police saw bullets falling from the appellant’s pants and believed that he was hiding something, they conducted a second pat-down search, this time finding a loaded handgun. A strip search at the police station found no further contraband.

[3]                             At trial, the appellant applied to exclude the evidence of the gun, ammunition, and drugs on the basis that the police had breached his rights under ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter. The trial judge dismissed the application, admitted the evidence, and convicted the appellant of several drug and firearm offences, including possession of fentanyl and a loaded prohibited firearm. A majority of the Court of Appeal of Alberta dismissed his appeal. The appellant now appeals to this Court as of right.

[4]                              For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal. The police breached s. 9 of the Charter by arresting the appellant based on a mistake of law about the legal status of gabapentin. They then breached s. 8 of the Charter by searching his person and car incident to the unlawful arrest. However, the subsequent pat-down search of the appellant was a lawful search incident to a parallel investigative detention for the traffic collision investigation. In addition, the strip search at the police station was a lawful search incident to arrest for possession of a prohibited firearm. Although all the impugned evidence was “obtained in a manner” that breached the Charter, I would not exclude it under s. 24(2). The Charter breaches were at the less serious end of the scale of culpability and only moderately impacted the appellant’s Charter-protected interests. On the other side of the ledger, the evidence was reliable and essential to the prosecution of serious offences. In my view, weighing these considerations, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

II.            Facts

[5]                             On the afternoon of October 8, 2016, a member of the public called 9-1-1 to report a single-vehicle collision on Memorial Drive in Calgary. The appellant’s car had veered off the road, hit a roadside sign, and continued for about a kilometre before it became disabled. Fire, medical, and police services rushed to the scene. The appellant was standing at the side of the road talking to a firefighter when a police officer arrived.

[6]                             The officer, suspecting that the appellant had fled the scene of the collision, approached the appellant and asked if he had been involved in an accident. The appellant acknowledged that he had hit the sign, but he claimed that he could not stop. The officer asked the appellant for his driver’s licence, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. The appellant said he would get the documents from his car. The officer followed him as he did so.

[7]                             When the appellant opened the driver-side door, the officer saw a small ziplock bag containing a single yellow pill near the window controls in the door area. The appellant’s eyes motioned to the pill, and he quickly swiped it to the ground outside of the car, as if he were trying to hide it. The officer recognized the pill as gabapentin, which he had seen trafficked on the street with illegal drugs such as fentanyl and methamphetamine. Because the officer believed that gabapentin was a controlled drug under the CDSA, he immediately arrested the appellant for possession of a controlled substance. He did not ask the appellant about the drug because he wanted to arrest and caution him without delay. However, as the officer later learned, gabapentin — which goes by the street name “gabby” or “gabbies” — is not a controlled substance but rather a prescription painkiller and anti-seizure medication. It is also trafficked and used as a recreational drug for the high it creates.[1]

[8]                             After the appellant was arrested, the police conducted four searches. The legality of those searches was challenged in the courts below and before this Court.

[9]                             In the first search, the officer conducted a pat-down search of the appellant’s person incident to arrest. This search revealed live ammunition for a .22 calibre rifle and a .45 calibre handgun, five fentanyl pills, two pills later identified as hydromorphone (an opioid and controlled substance under the CDSA), two pills later identified as alprazolam (a tranquillizer and controlled substance under the CDSA), another gabapentin pill, three cell phones, and $480 in cash.

[10]                        In the second search, another police officer, who arrived moments before the arresting officer placed the appellant under arrest, searched the appellant’s car incident to arrest. He found a folded serrated knife, a canister of bear spray, four fentanyl pills, and two pills later identified as alprazolam.

[11]                        In the third search, the arresting officer searched the appellant’s person again because he became concerned that the first search might have missed some items. His suspicions were aroused because the appellant was walking strangely while being taken to the patrol car: he was limping and shaking his leg, as if he had something hidden in his pants or falling down his pant leg. The officer then saw .22 calibre ammunition fall from the leg of the appellant’s pants. While searching his person, the officer touched the outside of the appellant’s pants in his groin area and felt a metal object. A double-barrelled handgun immediately fell from his pants. The gun was loaded with two live rounds, one in each barrel.

[12]                        In the fourth search, the appellant was strip searched at the police station. The appellant was asked to strip down to his underwear and an officer searched around his waistband to see if he had hidden anything else. No more contraband was found.

III.         Judgments Below

A.           Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta (Sullivan J.)

[13]                        On a voir dire, the appellant asserted that the police had infringed his rights under ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, and he sought to exclude the evidence of the fentanyl, ammunition, and handgun under s. 24(2). The trial judge held that the warrantless arrest did not violate s. 9 of the Charter, as the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that an offence had been committed, even though possession of gabapentin was not an offence. The officer had a subjective belief that gabapentin was a controlled substance, and his belief was objectively reasonable given his experience seeing it trafficked with other street drugs and his observation of the appellant trying to hide the pill. The trial judge held that the searches at the scene were incident to a lawful arrest, and they therefore did not infringe s. 8 of the Charter. Although the trial judge found no breach of s. 8 or s. 9 of the Charter, he said that he had considered all the factors under s. 24(2) and admitted the evidence. The appellant then pleaded guilty to possession of fentanyl and to several firearms offences.

B.            Court of Appeal of Alberta, 2020 ABCA 469, 397 C.C.C. (3d) 163 (McDonald and Wakeling JJ.A., Veldhuis J.A. (Dissenting))

[14]                        The Court of Appeal of Alberta divided on whether ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter were infringed and whether the evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2).

[15]                        The majority found no breach of s. 8 or s. 9 of the Charter and dismissed the appeal. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the appellant had committed an indictable offence, and the officer could thus arrest him without a warrant under s. 495(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. The arresting officer’s mistake of law — in believing that gabapentin was a controlled substance under the CDSA — did not invalidate the arrest. The officer was not enforcing a “non-existent law”; “[h]e was enforcing the CDSA pertaining to the possession of a controlled substance” (para. 36). Although the officer made a mistake of law, he believed on reasonable and probable grounds in a state of facts and law that, had they existed, would have resulted in the offence of possession of a controlled substance. The officer was not expected to be perfect in hindsight. He acted in good faith and his actions were reasonable in the circumstances. There was thus no breach of s. 9 of the Charter. Since the arrest was lawful, the searches did not infringe s. 8 of the Charter. There was no need to consider s. 24(2).

[16]                        The dissenting judge concluded that the police breached ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter. The appellant’s arrest was arbitrary and breached s. 9. Although the officer had a subjective belief that the appellant was in possession of a controlled substance, that belief was not objectively reasonable. The police must be familiar with and consult the legislation that they are enforcing. Here, the arresting officer made a mistake of law about the legal status of gabapentin. There were no safety concerns, urgency, or other circumstances requiring an immediate arrest, and the appellant was cooperating with the police at the time of his arrest. All four searches breached s. 8 of the Charter. The Crown conceded that the first and second searches breached s. 8 if the arrest was arbitrary. The dissenting judge ruled that the Crown did not prove independent grounds justifying the third and fourth searches. The officer’s evidence did not establish grounds for a safety search incident to an investigative detention.

[17]                          The dissenting judge would have excluded all the evidence under s. 24(2) of the Charter and acquitted the appellant. The Charter-infringing state conduct was serious: the arresting officer was not acting in good faith, since his belief that the appellant had committed an offence was not reasonable in the circumstances; he did not make use of the investigative detention powers available to him; and he took no reasonable steps to investigate whether the appellant possessed a controlled substance. The impact on the appellant’s Charter-protected interests was serious, since he was subject to searches of varying degrees of intrusion, culminating in a highly invasive strip search. The final balancing led to excluding the evidence, as admitting it would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Although society’s interest in adjudicating this case on the merits supported admission of the evidence, the seriousness of the breaches and the impact on the appellant’s Charter-protected interests supported exclusion.

IV.         Issues

[18]                        The appellant raises three issues:

A.      Did the police infringe s. 9 of the Charter by arresting the appellant based on a mistake of law?

B.        Did the four searches infringe s. 8 of the Charter?

C.        Should the evidence be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter?

V.           Analysis

A.           Did the Police Infringe Section 9 of the Charter by Arresting the Appellant Based on a Mistake of Law?

(1)         Introduction

[19]                        The first issue is whether the police infringed the appellant’s right against arbitrary detention under s. 9 of the Charter by arresting him based on a mistake of law. The Crown concedes that the appellant’s arrest involved a mistake of law as to whether gabapentin was a controlled substance under the CDSA. However, the Crown claims that the majority of the Court of Appeal correctly held that an arrest based on a reasonable mistake of law is nevertheless lawful.

[20]                        I disagree. As I will explain, an arrest based on a mistake of law is unlawful and infringes s. 9 of the Charter.

(2)         Applicable Legal Principles

(a)           Section 9 of the Charter

[21]                        Section 9 of the Charter provides that “[e]veryone has the right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned.” This Court has adopted a generous and purposive approach to the interpretation of s. 9, one that seeks to balance society’s interest in effective policing with robust protection for constitutional rights (see R. v. Suberu, 2009 SCC 33, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 460, at para. 24; R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, at paras. 15-18 and 23). The purpose of s. 9, broadly stated, “is to protect individual liberty from unjustified state interference” (Grant, at para. 20; see also R. v. Le, 2019 SCC 34, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 692, at para. 25).

[22]                        Consistent with this purpose, a lawful arrest or detention is not arbitrary, and does not infringe s. 9 of the Charter, unless the law authorizing the arrest or detention is itself arbitrary (see Grant, at para. 54; R. v. Mann, 2004 SCC 52, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 59, at para. 20). Conversely, an unlawful arrest or detention is necessarily arbitrary and infringes s. 9 of the Charter (see Grant, para. 54; R. v. Loewen, 2011 SCC 21, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 167, at para. 3).

(b)         The Power of a Peace Officer to Arrest Without a Warrant

[23]                        Sections 495(1)(a) and (b) of the Criminal Code provide that a peace officer may arrest without warrant “a person who has committed an indictable offence or who, on reasonable grounds, he believes has committed or is about to commit an indictable offence” or “a person whom he finds committing a criminal offence”.

[24]                        The applicable framework for a warrantless arrest was set out in R. v. Storrey, 1990 CanLII 125 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 241, at pp. 250-51. A warrantless arrest requires both subjective and objective grounds. The arresting officer must subjectively have reasonable and probable grounds for the arrest, and those grounds must be justifiable from an objective viewpoint. The objective assessment is based on the totality of the circumstances known to the officer at the time of the arrest, including the dynamics of the situation, as seen from the perspective of a reasonable person with comparable knowledge, training, and experience as the arresting officer. The police are not required to have a prima facie case for conviction before making the arrest (see also R. v. Feeney, 1997 CanLII 342 (SCC), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 13, at para. 24; R. v. Stillman, 1997 CanLII 384 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 607, at para. 28; R. v. Chehil, 2013 SCC 49, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 220, at paras. 45-47; R. v. MacKenzie, 2013 SCC 50, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 250, at para. 73).

[25]                        The existence of reasonable and probable grounds is founded on the trial judge’s factual findings. Although such factual findings attract appellate deference and are reviewable only for palpable and overriding error, whether the facts as found by the trial judge amount to reasonable and probable grounds is a question of law reviewable for correctness (see R. v. Shepherd, 2009 SCC 35, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 527, at para. 20).

[26]                        The specific s. 9 Charter issue raised here is whether an arrest based on a mistake of law is unlawful. Can a police officer arrest someone whom they believe has committed an offence, even if the facts relied on by the arresting officer, if true, do not involve unlawful conduct? In my view, the answer is no. As I will elaborate, precedent, principle, and legal policy preclude a lawful arrest based on a mistake of law.

(c)           Precedent

[27]                        This Court first ruled that a lawful arrest cannot be based on a mistake of law in Frey v. Fedoruk, 1950 CanLII 24 (SCC), [1950] S.C.R. 517. Frey involved a civil action for false imprisonment brought by a “peeping tom” against a police officer and another person after the officer arrested the voyeur for breach of the peace. The Court held that the conduct for which the plaintiff was arrested was not a criminal offence and should not be recognized as a new offence at common law (voyeurism is now contrary to s. 162(1) of the Criminal Code). Frey is usually cited for the proposition that it is for Parliament and not the courts to create new offences or to expand the basis of criminal liability (see R. v. D.L.W., 2016 SCC 22, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 402, at para. 57; R. v. McDonnell, 1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948, at para. 33; United Nurses of Alberta v. Alberta (Attorney General), 1992 CanLII 99 (SCC), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 901, at p. 930; D. Stuart, Canadian Criminal Law: A Treatise (8th ed. 2020), at pp. 21-22; M. Manning and P. Sankoff, Manning, Mewett & Sankoff: Criminal Law (5th ed. 2015), at pp. 6-7). But the Court in Frey also held that an officer’s mistake of law in believing that certain conduct was a criminal offence could not provide “reasonable and probable grounds” for a warrantless arrest under what was then s. 30 of the Criminal Code (p. 531). A warrantless arrest is lawful only if the arresting officer’s reasonable belief in the facts, if true, traces a pathway to a criminal offence known to the law. As Cartwright J. (as he then was) explained in Frey, at p. 531:

I think that [s. 30 of the Criminal Code] contemplates the situation where a Peace Officer, on reasonable and probable grounds, believes in the existence of a state of facts which, if it did exist would have the legal result that the person whom he was arresting had commit[t]ed an offence for which such person could be arrested without a warrant. It cannot, I think, mean that a Peace Officer is justified in arresting a person when the true facts are known to the Officer and he erroneously concludes that they amount to an offence, when, as a matter of law, they do not amount to an offence at all. “Ignorantia legis non excusat”. [Emphasis added.]

[28]                        Frey was recently affirmed on this point in Kosoian v. Société de transport de Montréal, 2019 SCC 59, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 335. In Kosoian, a subway passenger sued the police when she was arrested and searched for refusing to comply with a subway pictogram warning passengers to hold an escalator handrail. The Court ruled that the pictogram was simply a warning and did not create an offence, and the police officer’s error of law in believing otherwise did not provide reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the passenger without a warrant under Quebec’s Code of Penal Procedure, CQLR, c. C‑25.1 (“C.P.P.”). In Kosoian, at para. 78, citing Frey, Côté J. stated that the reasonable grounds concept relates to the facts, not the existence of an offence in law — and thus an arrest based on a mistake of law is unlawful, even if the arresting officer believes in good faith that the offence exists:

The exercise of these powers presupposes that there are reasonable grounds to believe an offence has been committed. The “reasonable grounds” concept relates to the facts, not to the existence in law of the offence in question (Frey v. Fedoruk, 1950 CanLII 24 (SCC), [1950] S.C.R. 517, at p. 531). If the offence that the police officer believes has been committed simply does not exist, neither the C.P.P. nor, for that matter, any other statute or common law rule gives the officer the power to require a person to identify himself or herself and to arrest the person if he or she refuses to comply (see Moore v. The Queen, 1978 CanLII 160 (SCC), [1979] 1 S.C.R. 195, at pp. 205‑6, per Dickson J., dissenting; R. v. Guthrie (1982), 1982 ABCA 201 (CanLII), 21 Alta. L.R. (2d) 1, at p. 8; R. v. Coles, 2003 PESCAD 3, 221 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 98, at para. 14). An officer who makes an arrest on this basis is acting unlawfully, even if he or she believes in good faith that the offence exists (R. v. Houle (1985), 1985 ABCA 275 (CanLII), 41 Alta. L.R. (2d) 295, at pp. 297‑99; Crépeau v. Yannonie, [1988] R.R.A. 265 (Que. Sup. Ct.), at p. 269; see also P. Ceyssens, Legal Aspects of Policing (loose‑leaf), vol. 1, at p. 2‑3). It was therefore incumbent upon Constable Camacho to verify the existence of the offence alleged against Ms. Kosoian before using the powers conferred on him by the C.P.P. [Underlining added.]

See, to similar effect, Hudson v. Brantford Police Services Board (2001), 2001 CanLII 8594 (ON CA), 158 C.C.C. (3d) 390 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 24, per Rosenberg J.A. (s. 25(1) of the Criminal Code, which protects a peace officer from civil liability when acting on “reasonable grounds”, encompasses mistakes of fact, but “[i]t does not protect against reasonable mistakes of law”); R. v. Douglas, 2021 ONCJ 562, at paras. 47-48 (CanLII), per Rose J. (“A lawful arrest must have lawful grounds, which excludes the possibility of a mistake of law.”). See also R. J. Marin, Admissibility of Statements (9th ed. (loose-leaf)), at § 9:51 (“[B]ecause the risk of abuse is undeniable, it is important there must be a legal basis for police actions. In the absence of justification their actions and conduct cannot be tolerated”.); E. G. Ewaschuk, Criminal Pleadings & Practice in Canada (2nd ed. (loose-leaf)), at § 5:59 (“[A]n officer who arrests someone on the basis of a ‘non-existent offence’ may be civilly liable”.).

[29]                        Although Frey and Kosoian were civil cases, this Court’s conclusion that a lawful arrest cannot be based on a mistake of law applies equally in the criminal context. In both cases, this Court analyzed the lawfulness of a warrantless arrest based on a mistake of law as part of a chain of reasoning to find civil liability. That reasoning concerns the scope of police powers and applies equally to the criminal context. See Hill v. Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police Services Board, 2007 SCC 41, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 129, at para. 68, per McLachlin C.J. (The reasonable officer standard in civil cases “entails no conflict between criminal standards” but rather “incorporates them”.); G. Cournoyer, Code criminel annoté 2021 (2020), s. 129 ([translation] “If the offence that the police officer believes has been committed simply does not exist, the officer does not have the power to require a person to identify himself or herself or the power to arrest the person if he or she refuses to comply.”).

(d)         Principle and Legal Policy

[30]                        Compelling considerations of principle and legal policy confirm that a lawful arrest cannot be based on a mistake of law — that is, when the officer knows the facts and erroneously concludes that they amount to an offence, when, as a matter of law, they do not. Allowing the police to arrest someone based on what they believe the law is — rather than based on what the law actually is — would dramatically expand police powers at the expense of civil liberties. This would leave people at the mercy of what particular police officers happen to understand the law to be and would create disincentives for the police to know the law. Canadians rightly expect the police to follow the law, which requires the police to know the law. This Court has affirmed that “[w]hile police are not expected to engage in judicial reflection on conflicting precedents, they are rightly expected to know what the law is” (Grant, at para. 133; Le, at para. 149). Côté J. helpfully encapsulated the relevant considerations of principle and legal policy in Kosoian, at para. 6:

In a free and democratic society, police officers may interfere with the exercise of individual freedoms only to the extent provided for by law. Every person can therefore legitimately expect that police officers who deal with him or her will comply with the law in force, which necessarily requires them to know the statutes, regulations and by-laws they are called upon to enforce. Police officers are thus obliged to have an adequate knowledge and understanding of the statutes, regulations and by-laws they have to enforce.

[31]                        It is thus unlawful for the police to arrest someone based on a mistake of law.

(e)           American Jurisprudence

[32]                        Given the Canadian precedents on point, I see no pressing need to turn to American jurisprudence. The majority of the Court of Appeal of Alberta, however, found persuasive the reasoning of the majority of the Supreme Court of the United States in Heien v. North Carolina, 574 U.S. 54 (2014), which held that a traffic stop based on a reasonable mistake of law does not infringe the right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure protected by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

[33]                        In Heien, the police stopped a car because one of its two brake lights was out, even though the state law, while ambiguous, was later held to require only one working light. The police became suspicious during the stop, secured consent to search the car, and found cocaine. Under the Fourth Amendment, a traffic stop for a suspected offence is considered “a ‘seizure’ of the occupants of the vehicle” (p. 60).

[34]                        Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts ruled that the traffic stop did not infringe the Fourth Amendment, as the officer made a reasonable mistake of law (pp. 66-68). Justice Sotomayor, dissenting, concluded that “an officer’s mistake of law, no matter how reasonable, cannot support the individualized suspicion necessary to justify a seizure under the Fourth Amendment” (p. 80).

[35]                        With respect, I do not find Heien to be helpful in deciding on the legality of an arrest based on a mistake of law under Canadian law. This Court has noted that the greatest caution must be exercised before transplanting American decisions under the Fourth Amendment to the Canadian context under s. 8 of the Charter (see Hunter v. Southam Inc., 1984 CanLII 33 (SCC), [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at p. 161). This is in part because “the Charter regime mandates a more flexible and contextual approach to the admissibility of evidence than the United States Constitution; thus there is no counterpart to s. 24(2) of the Charter in that country” (Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada (Director of Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices Commission), 1990 CanLII 135 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 425, at pp. 546-47, per La Forest J.). This note of caution, coupled with this Court’s own precedents on point, provide good reasons not to import American precedent in this case.

(f)            Conclusion

[36]                        Canadian law has long held that an arrest based on a mistake of law is unlawful, even if the mistake is made in good faith. The concept of “reasonable and probable grounds” for arrest relates to the facts, not the existence of an offence in law. A police officer makes a mistake of law when the officer knows the facts and erroneously concludes that they amount to an offence, when, as a matter of law, they do not.

(3)         Application

[37]                        I will now apply the Storrey framework to the subjective and objective grounds for the warrantless arrest in this case.

[38]                        The arresting officer subjectively believed that he had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the appellant for possession of a controlled substance under the CDSA. The arresting officer testified that he arrested the appellant because he saw him “swipe” a pill “to the ground”, and he believed that the appellant was “trying to hide it” from his view (A.R., at p. 141). The arresting officer immediately identified the pill as gabapentin, which he had seen “traded amongst people on the street” and “for some reason” believed was a controlled substance (A.R., at p. 145). He thus “arrested [the appellant] for possession of a controlled substance” (A.R., at p. 141). The question is then whether the arresting officer’s subjective belief was objectively reasonable.

[39]                        The arresting officer’s subjective belief that he had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the appellant was based on a mistake of law, and thus was not — and could not be — objectively reasonable. The arrest was consequently unlawful and arbitrary, contrary to s. 9 of the Charter. As noted by the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal of Alberta, at para. 66, the officer was not mistaken about any facts, because he correctly identified the pill as gabapentin. Instead, as the Crown conceded on appeal, the officer was mistaken as to the law on those facts — about the legal status of gabapentin, which was not a controlled substance under the CDSA.

[40]                        Before this Court, the Crown again concedes that the officer’s mistake “can be classified as a legal error” (transcript, at p. 25; see also R.F., at para. 43), but submits that the arrest was unlike the arrests in Frey and Kosoian. The Crown says that the officer arrested the appellant for possession of a controlled substance under the CDSA — an existing offence at law.

[41]                        I do not accept this submission. The officer arrested the appellant for possession of gabapentin specifically. The officer knew the facts — he correctly identified the pill as gabapentin — but mistakenly concluded that possession of gabapentin was an offence, when, in law, it was not. That brings this case squarely within Frey and Kosoian. It makes no difference whether the mistake of law involves a non-existent offence, or an existing offence that could not be engaged on the facts, even if true, relied on by the officer. In both instances, the mistake of law precludes a lawful arrest. The courts below erred in concluding otherwise.

[42]                        To be clear, I am not suggesting that the police must see and correctly identify a specific drug from the hundreds of controlled substances under the CDSA before they may lawfully arrest a suspected drug offender. Police routinely arrest suspected drug offenders for potential infractions of the CDSA, even when they do not see or identify specific drugs. Courts routinely uphold the legality of such arrests, if they conclude that there were reasonable and probable grounds to arrest (see, e.g., Loewen, at paras. 7-8; R. v. Orr, 2021 BCCA 42, 399 C.C.C. (3d) 441, at para. 78; R. v. Griffith, 2021 ONCA 302, 71 C.R. (7th) 239, at paras. 29-33; R. v. Todd, 2019 SKCA 36, [2019] 9 W.W.R. 207, at paras. 6-11 and 44; R. v. Canary, 2018 ONCA 304, 361 C.C.C. (3d) 63, at paras. 25-31; R. v. Messina, 2013 BCCA 499, 346 B.C.A.C. 179, at paras. 26-29; R. v. Wilson, 2012 BCCA 517, 331 B.C.A.C. 195, at paras. 14 and 52, leave to appeal refused, [2013] 3 S.C.R. xii).

[43]                        I conclude that the arrest was unlawful and infringed s. 9 of the Charter.

B.            Did the Four Searches Infringe Section 8 of the Charter?

(1)         Introduction

[44]                        I now turn to consider whether the four searches infringed the appellant’s s. 8 Charter right “to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure”. Recall that the four warrantless searches were: (1) an initial pat-down search of the appellant’s person incident to arrest; (2) a search of his car incident to arrest; (3) a second pat-down search of his person; and (4) a strip search at the police station. As I will explain, I conclude that the first two searches breached s. 8 of the Charter, but the third and fourth searches did not.

(2)         General Principles

[45]                        A warrantless search is prima facie unreasonable, and thus contrary to s. 8 of the Charter. The Crown bears the onus of demonstrating on a balance of probabilities that a warrantless search was reasonable (see R. v. Caslake, 1998 CanLII 838 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 51, at para. 11; R. v. Nolet, 2010 SCC 24, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 851, at para. 21; R. v. Buhay, 2003 SCC 30, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 631, at para. 32).

[46]                        A search is reasonable, and thus complies with s. 8 of the Charter, if: (1) the search is authorized by law; (2) the law authorizing the search is reasonable; and (3) the search is conducted in a reasonable manner (see R. v. Collins, [1987] 1. S.C.R. 265, at p. 278; Caslake, at para. 10; R. v. Saeed, 2016 SCC 24, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 518, at para. 36).

[47]                        Here, the laws potentially authorizing the searches are the common law powers to search incident to arrest (the first and second searches), to search incident to investigative detention (the third search), and to strip search (the fourth search). I will address each potential power below.

(3)         The First and Second Searches: Unlawful Searches Incident to Arrest

[48]                        The Crown concedes that the first two searches — the initial pat-down search of the appellant’s person and the search of the appellant’s car on discovering the gabapentin — were purportedly conducted incident to arrest, and that if the appellant’s arrest was unlawful, then these searches were also unlawful and breached s. 8 of the Charter. I agree with this concession.

[49]                        To be valid, a search incident to arrest must meet three conditions: (1) the person searched is lawfully arrested; (2) the search is “truly incidental” to the arrest, i.e., for a valid law enforcement purpose related to the reasons for the arrest; and (3) the search is conducted reasonably (see Saeed, at para. 37; R. v. Fearon, 2014 SCC 77, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 621, at paras. 21 and 27; R. v. Stairs, 2022 SCC 11, at paras. 6 and 35).

[50]                        Here, the initial pat-down search of the appellant’s person and the search of his car incident to arrest falter on the first condition: the appellant was not lawfully arrested. Thus, the first two searches necessarily breached s. 8 of the Charter.

(4)         The Third Search: A Lawful Search Incident to Investigative Detention

[51]                        The dissenting judge concluded that the third search — the further pat-down search of the appellant’s person — could not be justified as a search incident to investigative detention because the arresting officer did not have a subjective belief that his safety was at risk.

[52]                        I respectfully disagree. The third search was a lawful search incident to investigative detention relating to the traffic collision investigation.

[53]                        This Court in Mann recognized that the police have a common law power to search incident to investigative detention under certain circumstances. Speaking for the majority, Iacobucci J. stated that “police officers may detain an individual for investigative purposes if there are reasonable grounds to suspect in all the circumstances that the individual is connected to a particular crime and that such a detention is necessary” (para. 45). He added that a police officer “may engage in a protective pat-down search of the detained individual” when the officer “has reasonable grounds to believe that his or her safety or that of others is at risk” (para. 45). In addition, both the investigative detention and the pat-down search “must be conducted in a reasonable manner” (para. 45; see also R. v. Clayton, 2007 SCC 32, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 725, at paras. 20 and 29-31).

[54]                        Here, the dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal appeared to accept that there was a lawful investigative detention, both for the drug investigation and for the traffic collision investigation. She said that she “agree[d] with the Crown that the objective factual matrix met the test for an investigative detention related to controlled substances” (para. 77). She also noted that, “[a]t trial, the appellant conceded [that] he was detained for the purposes of investigating the motor-vehicle accident in any event” (para. 77).

[55]                        The appellant, however, argues that the dissenting judge erred in finding grounds to detain him for the drug investigation. He submits that if the officer’s “mistake of law about [g]abapentin could not justify a warrantless arrest on reasonable and probable grounds, then it should similarly be incapable of supporting an investigative detention on reasonable suspicion that [the appellant] was connected ‘to a particular crime’” (A.F., at para. 94).

[56]                        I agree with the appellant. Just as a warrantless arrest based on a mistake of law infringes s. 9 of the Charter, so too does an investigative detention based on a mistake of law.

[57]                        However, the dissenting judge was correct that the police could detain the appellant for the traffic collision investigation, as the appellant conceded. The police’s interaction with the appellant was at first a traffic collision investigation. The arresting officer testified that he came to where the appellant’s damaged car had stopped and approached him because he suspected that he had fled the scene of a collision with a roadside sign.

[58]                        In doing so, the officer was properly exercising investigatory powers under provincial traffic law and the Criminal Code. Section 69(1)(a) of Alberta’s Traffic Safety Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. T-6, requires a driver or any other person in charge of a vehicle involved in a motor-vehicle accident on a road to “remain at the scene of the accident or, if the person has left the scene of the accident, [to] immediately return to the scene of the accident unless otherwise directed by a peace officer”. The driver or any other person in charge of the vehicle must also provide the peace officer with requested information as provided by law (see Traffic Safety Act, s. 69(1)(c)). Thus, a driver involved in a car accident “ha[s] a duty, separate and apart from the criminal law, to remain at the scene of the accident” (R. v. Rowson, 2015 ABCA 354, 332 C.C.C. (3d) 165 (“Rowson (ABCA)”), at para. 44, aff’d 2016 SCC 40, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 158). There is “no ability to choose not to cooperate with the police if one is the driver of a car involved in an automobile accident” — such a driver is “not free to go” (Rowson (ABCA), at para. 44). Furthermore, under s. 320.16(1) of the Criminal Code, it is an offence, in certain circumstances, to fail to stop after a traffic accident.

[59]                        As a result, the appellant had no right to refuse to cooperate with the police, nor was he free to go. He was lawfully detained as part of a traffic collision investigation, even if he could not be lawfully detained as part of a drug investigation.

[60]                        This takes me to whether the arresting officer had reasonable grounds to believe that his safety or the safety of others was at risk (see Mann, at paras. 40 and 45; see also R. v. Thibodeau, 2007 BCCA 489, 247 B.C.A.C. 103, at para. 10, leave to appeal refused, [2008] 1 S.C.R. xiii). The dissenting judge concluded that the officer had no such grounds. She cited the officer’s testimony to the effect that he conducted another pat-down search because he was concerned that he may have “missed some items” after he saw bullets falling out of the appellant’s pant leg, which she concluded showed that he did not believe that “his safety was at stake”, but rather that he was “concerned about collecting evidence” (para. 80). The officer’s testimony was as follows:

Q. [Crown counsel]: After you found these items [i.e., the drugs and ammunition found on the appellant], what did you do?

 

A.: So once I had found all these items on the accused, I started walking him towards my police vehicle. At that time, he started limping and shaking his leg, which seemed strange to me at the time. It’s almost as though he had something falling down his pant leg or something concealed in his pants. So when I got him to my vehicle, before I placed him in the vehicle, more ammunition, like, .22 calibre ammunition, fell from inside of his pant leg, which was suspicious to me. So I conducted another search, thinking that I’ve missed some items. [Emphasis added.]

 

(A.R., at p. 150)

[61]                        On this basis, the dissenting judge inferred that “[t]he officer did not turn his mind to or have any concerns about conducting a safety search” (para. 81).

[62]                        I disagree. While the dissenting judge’s inference is a possible reading of the transcript, it is not the only possible reading, nor even the most plausible reading. I read the officer’s evidence in context as expressing concern for whether he might have “missed some items” that would pose a safety risk to himself or to others. The officer had just found bullets on the appellant during a pat-down search, and then he saw more bullets falling from his pants. The appellant was “limping and shaking his leg”, as if he had “something concealed in his pants”. The obvious “something” was a gun.

[63]                        This reading of the arresting officer’s evidence as expressing safety concerns is confirmed by the evidence of the other officer who was at the scene. He testified that he got out of his police cruiser “due to the fact that it was ammunition that was located”, and he therefore “stayed with them for a moment while [the arresting officer] continued to search” (A.R., at p. 163). This evidence also suggests that the officers suspected that the appellant might have been armed, thereby posing a clear risk to the police and the public.

[64]                        I therefore conclude that the arresting officer did express subjective concerns about safety, even if only implicitly, and that those concerns were objectively reasonable in the circumstances. When there are concealed bullets, there may be a concealed gun. The further pat-down search of the appellant’s person, in which the officer dislodged a loaded handgun by merely touching the outside of the appellant’s pants, was also conducted reasonably. This search did not breach s. 8 of the Charter.

(5)         The Fourth Search: A Lawful Strip Search

[65]                        Although the dissenting judge did not separately address the strip search of the appellant at the police station, she seemed to conclude that it was unlawful on the same basis as the third search. No further evidence was found during the strip search.

[66]                        A strip search can be justified at common law as incident to a lawful arrest where there are “reasonable and probable grounds justifying the strip search, in addition to reasonable and probable grounds justifying the arrest” (R. v. Ali, 2022 SCC 1, at para. 2; R. v. Golden, 2001 SCC 83, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 679, at para. 99). Reasonable and probable grounds exist to justify a strip search “where there is some evidence suggesting the possibility of concealment of weapons or other evidence related to the reason for the arrest” (Ali, at para. 2; see also Golden, at paras. 94 and 111). The strip search must also be conducted reasonably, in a manner that “interferes with the privacy and dignity of the person being searched as little as possible” (Golden, at para. 104).

[67]                        Here, the appellant was lawfully arrested for the weapons offences after the ammunition and the handgun fell from his pants. The officer testified that, following the third search, he “seized the items that fell onto the ground out of [the appellant’s] pant leg . . . and then [he] placed the [appellant] in [his] vehicle, where he was chartered and cautioned” (A.R., at p. 152). The officer’s language and conduct conveyed clearly that the appellant was under arrest (see R. v. Latimer, 1997 CanLII 405 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 217, at para. 25). His conduct had the effect of placing the appellant under arrest for possession of a prohibited firearm (Latimer, at para. 24). I thus infer from the record that the appellant was placed under arrest for possession of a prohibited firearm following the third search.

[68]                        The strip search at the police station was incident to this weapons arrest, because it was for the purpose of discovering concealed weapons or evidence related to the offence for which the appellant was lawfully arrested (see Golden, at para. 94). Strip searches unquestionably “represent a significant invasion of privacy and are often a humiliating, degrading and traumatic experience for individuals subject to them” (Golden, at para. 83). However, the strip search here was minimally intrusive, as it was conducted reasonably, in a manner consistent with this Court’s guidelines for strip searches (see Golden, at paras. 101-2). It was performed at the police station, it was limited to the appellant’s underwear waistband, and the appellant wore his underwear throughout the search.

[69]                        I therefore conclude that the strip search did not infringe s. 8 of the Charter.

(6)         Conclusion

[70]                        The initial pat-down search of the appellant’s person and the search of his car infringed s. 8 of the Charter, but the further pat-down search and the strip search did not.

C.            Should the Evidence Be Excluded Under Section 24(2) of the Charter?

(1)         Introduction

[71]                        Given the breaches of ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, the final issue to consider is whether the evidence should have been excluded under s. 24(2). Section 24(2) provides that when “a court concludes that evidence was obtained in a manner” that infringed a Charter right, “the evidence shall be excluded if it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute”.

[72]                        Because the trial judge erred in law in assessing the nature and extent of the Charter breaches, no appellate deference is owed to his “alternative” conclusion to admit the evidence. This Court must therefore consider that issue afresh (see Grant, at para. 129; Le, at para. 138; R. v. Paterson, 2017 SCC 15, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 202, at para. 42).

[73]                        As I explain below, although all the impugned evidence was “obtained in a manner” that infringed the appellant’s Charter rights, the evidence should not be excluded under s. 24(2).

(2)         Applicable Legal Principles

[74]                        Section 24(2) of the Charter is triggered where evidence is “obtained in a manner” that violates an accused’s Charter rights. A s. 24(2) inquiry examines the impact of admitting evidence obtained in breach of the Charter on public confidence in the justice system over the long term, based on three lines of inquiry: (1) the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct; (2) the impact of the breach on the accused’s Charter-protected interests; and (3) society’s interest in the adjudication of the case on the merits. A court’s task is to balance the assessments under these three lines of inquiry “to determine whether, considering all the circumstances, admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute” (Grant, at para. 71; see also Le, at paras. 139-42).

[75]                        Section 24(2) does not create an automatic exclusionary rule when evidence is obtained in breach of a Charter right. The accused bears the onus of establishing that, having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute (see Collins, at p. 280; Fearon, at para. 89; see also S. C. Hill, D. M. Tanovich and L. P. Strezos, McWilliams’ Canadian Criminal Evidence (5th ed. (loose-leaf)), at § 19:12).

(3)         All the Evidence Seized Was “Obtained in a Manner” That Breached the Appellant’s Charter Rights

[76]                        Because I have concluded that the appellant’s arrest for possession of a controlled substance and the searches of his person and car incident to arrest infringed ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, the ammunition and illegal drugs seized during the first and second searches were “obtained in a manner” that breached his Charter rights. This triggers consideration of whether to exclude this evidence under s. 24(2) of the Charter.

[77]                        The key disputed point concerns whether the loaded handgun and ammunition found during the third search were “obtained in a manner” that breached the appellant’s Charter rights. The Crown submits that because the appellant was lawfully detained for the traffic collision investigation when the police saw bullets falling from his pants, the nexus between the unlawful drug arrest and the discovery of the gun and ammunition is tenuous. The Crown also says that the bullets falling from the appellant’s pants was “a significant intervening factor”, effectively breaking the chain of causation between the unlawful arrest and first two searches, on the one hand, and the evidence obtained during the third search, on the other hand (R.F., at para. 81). As a result, the Crown submits that the evidence found during the third search was not “obtained in a manner” that breached the appellant’s Charter rights. By contrast, the appellant submits that his unlawful arrest for possession of a controlled substance triggered all four searches, thus providing a temporal, causal, or contextual connection between the Charter breaches and the discovery of the gun and ammunition on his person. According to the appellant, all the evidence was “obtained in a manner” that breached his Charter rights. As I will explain, I agree with the appellant.

[78]                        This Court has provided guidance as to when evidence is “obtained in a manner” that breached an accused’s Charter rights so as to trigger s. 24(2):

1.         The courts take “a purposive and generous approach” to whether evidence was “obtained in a manner” that breached an accused’s Charter rights (R. v. Wittwer, 2008 SCC 33, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 21; R. v. Mack, 2014 SCC 58, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 38).

2.         The “entire chain of events” involving the Charter breach and the impugned evidence should be examined (R. v. Strachan, 1988 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 980, at pp. 1005-6).

3.         “Evidence will be tainted if the breach and the discovery of the impugned evidence are part of the same transaction or course of conduct” (Mack, at para. 38; see also Wittwer, at para. 21).

4.         The connection between the Charter breach and the impugned evidence can be “temporal, contextual, causal or a combination of the three” (Wittwer, at para.  21, quoting R. v. Plaha (2004), 2004 CanLII 21043 (ON CA), 189 O.A.C. 376, at para. 45). A causal connection is not required (Wittwer, at para. 21; R. v. Mian, 2014 SCC 54, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 689, at para. 83; Strachan, at pp. 1000-1002).

5.         A remote or tenuous connection between the Charter breach and the impugned evidence will not suffice to trigger s. 24(2) (Mack, at para. 38; Wittwer, at para. 21; R. v. Goldhart, 1996 CanLII 214 (SCC), [1996] 2 S.C.R. 463, at para. 40; Strachan, at pp. 1005-6). Such situations should be dealt with on a case by case basis. There is “no hard and fast rule for determining when evidence obtained following the infringement of a Charter right becomes too remote” (Strachan, at p. 1006).

See also R. v. Pino, 2016 ONCA 389, 130 O.R. (3d) 561, at para. 72; R. v. Lichtenwald, 2020 SKCA 70, 388 C.C.C. (3d) 377, at para. 57; R. v. Reilly, 2020 BCCA 369, 397 C.C.C. (3d) 219, at paras. 75-76, aff’d 2021 SCC 38; and Hill, Tanovich and Strezos, at § 19:22.

[79]                        Here, I need not decide whether, as urged by the Crown, the bullets falling from the appellant’s pants broke the chain of causation between the appellant’s unlawful arrest and the unlawful first two searches, on the one hand, and the lawful third search, on the other hand. Even if it could be said that there was no causal connection between the Charter breaches and the discovery of the evidence during the third search, there were undoubtedly temporal and contextual connections that were neither tenuous nor remote. The connection between the Charter breaches and the impugned evidence from the third search was temporal, because the discovery of this evidence was very close in time to the Charter breaches. The connection was also contextual, because the discovery of this evidence flowed directly out of the same encounter with the police: the third search arose because the officer was concerned that he had “missed some items” during the first search. The third search was also part of the same transaction or course of conduct as the first and second searches: the encounter began as a traffic collision investigation that quickly led to an unlawful arrest for possession of what was believed to be a controlled substance, which then immediately gave rise to safety concerns justifying the third search.

[80]                        Under this Court’s generous approach to the “obtained in a manner” threshold requirement, these temporal and contextual connections are sufficient to require consideration of whether the evidence obtained from the third search should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter, in addition to the evidence from the first two searches.

[81]                        I now turn to the three lines of inquiry under s. 24(2) of the Charter.

(4)         The Evidence Should Not Be Excluded Under Section 24(2) of the Charter

(a)           The Seriousness of the Charter-Infringing State Conduct

[82]                        The first line of inquiry under s. 24(2) considers the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct. It asks whether the police engaged in misconduct from which the court should dissociate itself (see Grant, at para. 72). The concern of this inquiry is “not to punish the police”, but rather to “preserve public confidence in the rule of law and its processes” (Grant, at para. 73). The court must situate the Charter-infringing conduct on a “spectrum” or a “scale of culpability” (Grant, at para. 74; Paterson, at para. 43; Le, at para. 143). At the more serious end of the culpability scale are wilful or reckless disregard of Charter rights, a systemic pattern of Charter-infringing conduct, or a major departure from Charter standards. Courts should dissociate themselves from such conduct because it risks bringing the administration of justice into disrepute. At the less serious end of the culpability scale are Charter breaches that are inadvertent, technical, or minor, or which reflect an understandable mistake. Such circumstances minimally undermine public confidence in the rule of law, and thus dissociation is much less of a concern (see Grant, at para. 74; Le, at para. 143; R. v. Harrison, 2009 SCC 34, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 494, at para. 22).

[83]                        I would situate this case at the less serious end of the scale of culpability. I say this for three reasons.

[84]                        First, the Charter-infringing state conduct underlying the appellant’s arrest and the searches incident to arrest was inadvertent, not deliberate, and reflected an honest mistake about whether gabapentin was one of the hundreds of controlled substances listed under the CDSA. While police officers are expected to know the law that they are enforcing, the arresting officer here had been on the force for only three years. In that brief time, he had seen gabapentin, which he knew by the street name “gabby”, trafficked with controlled substances such as fentanyl and methamphetamine. His experience was consistent with the jurisprudence that often mentions gabapentin alongside other controlled substances, even though it is a prescription drug (see above, at para. 7). In short, a relatively inexperienced officer arrested the appellant based on an honest mistake (see Fearon, at para. 95).

[85]                        Nevertheless, I agree with the appellant, and with the conclusion of the dissenting judge (at para. 84), that even though the officer’s mistake was not made in bad faith, this alone does not make the Charter breach in “good faith” (see Le, at para. 147). Good faith on the part of the police, if present, would reduce the need for the court to dissociate itself from the police conduct (see Grant, at para. 75; Paterson, at para. 44). Good faith cannot be claimed if the Charter breach arises from a police officer’s negligence, unreasonable error, ignorance as to the scope of their authority, or ignorance of Charter standards (see Grant, at para. 75; Buhay, at para. 59; Le, at para. 147; Paterson, at para. 44). I also accept that “[e]ven where the Charter infringement is not deliberate or the product of systemic or institutional abuse, exclusion has been found to be warranted for clear violations of well-established rules governing state conduct” (Paterson, at para. 44; see also Harrison, at paras. 24-25). Even so, in my view, the officer’s mistake and the ensuing Charter breaches remain honest and inadvertent, rather than wilful or reckless.

[86]                        Second, at no time did the police conduct display wilful blindness or a flagrant disregard for the appellant’s Charter rights (see Grant, at para. 75). To the contrary, the arresting officer tried to respect the appellant’s Charter rights throughout. His unchallenged evidence was that he arrested the appellant immediately, before asking him about the drug, because he wanted to advise him of his Charter rights without delay.

[87]                        I therefore disagree with the assertion of the appellant, and of the dissenting judge (at paras. 85-87 and 89), that the seriousness of the Charter breaches is aggravated by the officer’s failure to deploy non-Charter infringing investigatory techniques, such as using a brief investigative detention to confirm his suspicion about the legal status of gabapentin (see Collins, at p. 285). In my view, that assertion is based on a false premise. The trial judge found as fact that the officer believed rather than merely suspected that gabapentin was a controlled substance. Although the officer should have had an adequate understanding of the law that he was enforcing, he did not arrest the appellant based on a mere suspicion.

[88]                        Third, there is no evidence before the Court of a systemic problem or lack of training in the Calgary police force that contributed to the officer’s honest mistake. This Court has noted that “while evidence of a systemic problem can properly aggravate the seriousness of the breach and weigh in favour of exclusion, the absence of such a problem is hardly a mitigating factor” (Harrison, at para. 25). While not a mitigating factor, the absence of a systemic problem informs the court’s task of situating the officer’s mistake on a scale of culpability. As stated above, dissociation is less of a concern for an inadvertent or technical error (see Grant, at para. 74; Le, at para. 143; Harrison, at para. 22). In this case, the facts disclose human error, plain and simple, by a single, relatively inexperienced police officer.

[89]                        Given the officer’s honest mistake, the lack of a flagrant disregard for Charter rights, and the lack of a systemic problem, I would situate the Charter-infringing state conduct at the less serious end of the scale of culpability. This factor favours exclusion, but only weakly.

(b)         The Impact on the Appellant’s Charter-Protected Interests

[90]                        The second line of inquiry under s. 24(2) considers the impact of the breach on the accused’s Charter-protected interests. It asks whether the breach “actually undermined the interests protected by the right infringed” (Grant, at para. 76; Le, at para. 151). This involves identifying the interests protected by the relevant Charter rights and evaluating how seriously the breaches affected those interests (see Grant, at para. 77). As with the first Grant line of inquiry, the court must situate the impact on the accused’s Charter-protected interests on a spectrum, ranging from impacts that are fleeting, technical, transient, or trivial, to those that are profoundly intrusive or that seriously compromise the interests underlying the rights infringed. The greater the impact on Charter-protected interests, the greater the risk that admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. This is because “admission of the evidence may signal to the public that Charter rights, however high-sounding, are of little actual avail to the citizen, breeding public cynicism and bringing the administration of justice into disrepute” (Grant, at para. 76; see also Le, at para. 151; Harrison, at para. 28).

[91]                        In this case, I have found three Charter breaches: a breach of s. 9 in the appellant’s unlawful arrest; and two breaches of s. 8 in the unreasonable search of the appellant’s person and car incident to arrest. The interests protected by s. 9 of the Charter include the protection of “individual liberty from unjustified state interference” (Grant, at para. 20; Le, at para. 152), while the interests protected by s. 8 of the Charter include individual privacy and human dignity (see Grant, at para. 78; R. v. Cole, 2012 SCC 53, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 34, at para. 91). I would characterize the breaches here as having had a moderate impact on the appellant’s Charter-protected interests: while the impact was not fleeting, technical, transient, or trivial, it was not profoundly intrusive either.

[92]                        With regard to the impact of the s. 9 Charter breach, the appellant submits that his arbitrary arrest involved “unsanctioned state violence” on his liberty interest (A.F., at para. 122). He says that his arrest on a busy road was not brief or fleeting, and that handcuffs restricted his liberty and movement. Yet, as the Crown rightly notes, and as the appellant appropriately concedes, he was lawfully detained for the traffic collision investigation. He had to remain at the scene and cooperate with the police regarding the collision — he was not free to go (see Rowson (ABCA), at para. 44; see also Hill, Tanovich and Strezos, at § 19:36). Because the appellant’s liberty interests were lawfully restricted for the traffic collision investigation, this mitigates the impact of his arbitrary arrest to some extent.

[93]                        With regard to the impact of the s. 8 Charter breaches, the first search, a pat-down search, is a “relatively non-intrusive procedure” (Cloutier v. Langlois, 1990 CanLII 122 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 158, at p. 185), one that is “minimally intrusive” (Mann, at para. 56). The search here fit that description. The same can be said of the second search, a search of the appellant’s car incident to arrest, given the reduced expectation of privacy in a car (see MacKenzie, at para. 31; R. v. Belnavis, 1997 CanLII 320 (SCC), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 341, at para.  38; R. v. Wise, 1992 CanLII 125 (SCC), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 527, at p. 534).

[94]                        On the other side of the ledger, I am not prepared to speculate as to whether the evidence would have been discovered absent the Charter breaches. It is true that if the evidence were only discoverable through the Charter breach, then there would be a greater impact on the accused’s Charter-protected interests (see Grant, at paras. 122 and 137; R. v. Keller, 2019 ABCA 38, 372 C.C.C. (3d) 502, at para.  64). However, “in cases where it cannot be determined with any confidence whether evidence would have been discovered” absent a Charter breach, “discoverability will have no impact on the s. 24(2) inquiry” (Grant, at para. 122; see also Hill, Tanovich and Strezos, at § 19:49). Courts should not engage in speculation about discoverability (see R. v. Côté, 2011 SCC 46, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 215, at para. 70).

[95]                        Collecting these factors under the second line of inquiry, in my view, the Charter breaches arising from the unlawful arrest and the first two searches had a moderate impact on the appellant’s Charter-protected interests. The appellant was unlawfully arrested, but he was also lawfully detained for the traffic collision investigation; the searches were minimally intrusive, and I am not prepared to speculate on the issue of discoverability. These are not profoundly intrusive impacts, but they are not fleeting, technical, transient, or trivial either. This line of inquiry pulls moderately toward exclusion.

(c)           Society’s Interest in the Adjudication of the Case on the Merits

[96]                        The third line of inquiry considers factors such as the reliability of the impugned evidence and its importance to the Crown’s case. It asks “whether the truth-seeking function of the criminal trial process would be better served by admission of the evidence, or by its exclusion” (Grant, at para. 79). Reliable evidence critical to the Crown’s case will generally pull toward inclusion (see Grant, at paras. 80-81; Harrison, at paras. 33-34).

[97]                        Here, the evidence seized was reliable and relevant to the Crown’s prosecution of serious offences. The appellant concedes that the admission of this evidence would better serve the truth-seeking function of the criminal trial process than its exclusion. I agree.

(d)         The Final Balancing

[98]                        The final step in the s. 24(2) analysis involves balancing the factors under the three lines of inquiry to assess the impact of admission or exclusion of the evidence on the long-term repute of the administration of justice. Such balancing involves a qualitative exercise, one that is not capable of mathematical precision (see Grant, at paras. 86 and 140; Harrison, at para. 36). Each factor must be assessed and weighed in the balance, focussing on the long-term integrity of, and public confidence in, the administration of justice (see Grant, at para. 68). The balancing is prospective: it aims to ensure that evidence obtained through a Charter breach “does not do further damage to the repute of the justice system” (Grant, at para. 69). The balancing is also societal: the goal is not to punish the police, but rather to address systemic concerns by analyzing “the broad impact of admission of the evidence on the long-term repute of the justice system” (Grant, at para. 70; see also Le, at para. 139).

[99]                        I have concluded that the first line of inquiry under Grant pulls weakly toward exclusion and the second does so moderately, but the third pulls strongly toward admission. In my view, on these facts, the final balancing does not call for exclusion of the evidence to protect the long-term repute of the justice system. A relatively inexperienced police officer made an honest mistake about the legal status of gabapentin, a prescription drug that is traded on the street and that the appellant tried to hide during a lawful traffic collision investigation. That led to an arrest and searches incident to arrest, and to the discovery of a loaded gun, ammunition, and fentanyl — a drug that has been described as “public enemy number one” (R. v. Parranto, 2021 SCC 46, at para. 93, per Moldaver J.). Excluding this evidence would simply punish the police — which is not the purpose of s. 24(2) — and would damage, rather than vindicate, the long-term repute of the criminal justice system.

[100]                     I conclude that the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. I would therefore admit the evidence and affirm the convictions on all charges.

VI.         Disposition

[101]                     For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

 

                  The following are the reasons delivered by

 

                    Brown J. —

[102]                     I endorse my colleague’s conclusions, and his reasons therefor, that (1) an arrest based on a mistake of law is unlawful, (2) in this case, it resulted in a breach of the appellant’s rights under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, and (3) no deference is owed to the trial judge’s findings on s. 24(2) given his legal errors.

[103]                     I also agree with my colleague’s account of the law and principles governing s. 24(2). My point of respectful departure is on their application to the facts of the case, specifically as they relate to the seriousness of the Charter‑infringing conduct. On that point, I adopt the reasons of Veldhuis J.A., at paras. 84-89 (2020 ABCA 469, 397 C.C.C. (3d) 163).

[104]                     Taking that into account, and accepting my colleague’s discussion of the other lines of inquiry under R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, I find that admitting the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. I would therefore allow the appeal, exclude the evidence, and substitute verdicts of acquittal on all charges.

 

                    Appeal dismissed, Brown J. dissenting.
                    

2022 SCC 13

The appeal from the judgment of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, Number CAC 501626, 2021 NSCA 59, dated July 27, 2021, was heard on April 19, 2022, and the Court on that day delivered the following judgment orally:

Moldaver J. — Mr. Gerrard appeals his 13 domestic violence-related convictions to this Court, as of right, based upon a dissenting opinion at the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal. A majority of the Court of Appeal rejected his submissions that the trial judge erred both in her application of R. v. W.(D.), 1991 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, and her assessment of the complainant’s credibility.

We would dismiss the appeal. On the first issue, the trial judge instructed herself correctly on the W.(D.) test and its application. It is immaterial that the trial judge assessed the complainant’s credibility before the accused’s; this does not automatically demonstrate that she reversed the burden of proof (R. v. Vuradin, 2013 SCC 38, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 639, at para. 21). Rather, the trial judge’s reasons demonstrate that she did not evaluate the complainant’s evidence in isolation, but properly tested it against the evidence of other witnesses — including the accused — and offered cogent reasons for finding that the complainant’s evidence was credible without improperly marginalizing that of Mr. Gerrard’s or any of the other witnesses. Trial judges’ reasons must be read generously, as a whole, and with the presumption that the judge knows the law (R. v. G.F., 2021 SCC 20, at paras. 69 and 74). We see no reason to interfere with her analysis.

On the second issue, we do not accept Mr. Gerrard’s submission that the trial judge made improper credibility findings about the complainant regarding lack of motive to lie, lack of embellishment, and reluctance to report to the police and testify. The trial judge properly considered each of these factors in assessing the complainant’s credibility as a direct response to Mr. Gerrard’s defence at trial, namely that the complainant had long threatened to report him to the police and finally followed through with this threat by fabricating allegations because he made a derogatory comment about her to her daughter. Put another way, he alleged that she had a motive to lie and was, in fact, lying. Credibility findings are owed significant deference on appeal (G.F., at para. 81). The trial judge’s reasons were responsive to live issues at trial — raised by Mr. Gerrard — and reveal no error justifying intervention.

Two of these factors warrant a few additional comments. Lack of evidence of a complainant’s motive to lie may be relevant in assessing credibility, particularly where the suggestion is raised by the defence (R. v. Stirling, 2008 SCC 10, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 272, at paras. 10-11; R. v. Ignacio, 2021 ONCA 69, 400 C.C.C. (3d) 343, at paras. 38 and 52). Absence of evidence of motive to lie, or the existence of evidence disproving a particular motive to lie, is a common sense factor that suggests a witness may be more truthful because they do not have a reason to lie. That said, when considering this factor, trial judges must be alive to two risks: (1) the absence of evidence that a complainant has a motive to lie (i.e. there is no evidence either way) cannot be equated with evidence disproving a particular motive to lie (i.e. evidence establishing that the motive does not exist), as the latter requires evidence and is therefore a stronger indication of credibility — neither is conclusive in a credibility analysis; and (2) the burden of proof cannot be reversed by requiring the accused to demonstrate that the complainant has a motive to lie or explain why a complainant has made the allegations (R. v. Swain, 2021 BCCA 207, 406 C.C.C. (3d) 39, at paras. 31-33).

Lack of embellishment may also be relevant in assessing a complainant’s credibility and often arises in response to suggestions that the complainant has a motive to lie. But, unlike absence of evidence of motive to lie, or the existence of evidence disproving a particular motive to lie, lack of embellishment is not an indicator that a witness is more likely telling the truth because both truthful and dishonest accounts can be free of exaggeration or embellishment. Lack of embellishment cannot be used to bolster the complainant’s credibility — it simply does not weigh against it. It may, however, be considered as a factor in assessing whether or not the witness had a motive to lie.

For these reasons, we would dismiss the appeal.


2022 SCC 14

The appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, Number C66058, 2021 ONCA 224, dated April 9, 2021, was heard on April 21, 2022, and the Court on that day delivered the following judgment orally:

The Chief Justice — Mr. Alas was convicted at trial of second degree murder after he stabbed the deceased six times during an altercation at a bar. A majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal (MacPherson J.A. dissenting) overturned this verdict and ordered a new trial. The Crown appeals to this Court as of right. The sole issue is whether there was an air of reality to the defence of provocation, such that the trial judge erred in failing to put the defence to the jury. This offence pre-dated the amendment to the provocation provision, which applies to offences committed on or after July 17, 2015.

We find no error in the trial judge’s determination that there was no air of reality to the defence of provocation.

The standard of review for whether there is an air of reality to the defence of provocation is correctness (R. v. Cinous, 2002 SCC 29, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 55).

The key issue here is whether there is sufficient evidential basis as to the fourth element of the provocation defence — that the accused acted on the sudden.

Taking the evidence at its highest for the accused, for present purposes, the subjective element of the test for provocation has not been met. The accused did not react “on the sudden” before there was time for his passion to cool. It is beyond the range of reasonable inferences to say that Mr. Alas’ reaction to the deceased making a punching/lunging motion at the women was “on the sudden”; rather, it was the culmination of an altercation that Mr. Alas both instigated and anticipated. As he indicated in his statement to the police:

a)      Mr. Alas was aware that the deceased had an altercation with his friend earlier in the evening, during which the deceased closed a door on her head. 

b)      Mr. Alas was so upset about the deceased’s conduct that he wanted to hit the deceased in the head with a pool cue. He cooled down and did not take this course of action.

c)      When his fiancée and friend went outside to smoke, he told them that he would follow if he saw the deceased go outside as well: “. . . if I see this guy get up and come out, I’m coming . . . I’ll be right behind him” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 103).

d)      Mr. Alas observed the deceased preparing to leave the bar. In anticipation, he went outside to join the two women.

e)      When the deceased came out of the bar, he looked at Mr. Alas’ friend. In response to this look, Mr. Alas responded: “. . . [w]hat the fuck is wrong with you? Do you have a problem”? A verbal altercation ensued involving Mr. Alas, the deceased, and the two women (A.R., vol .II, at p. 104).

f)      During the verbal altercation, Mr. Alas retrieved a knife from his pants pocket and moved it to his jacket pocket “just in case”. With the knife gripped in his hand, he stared at the deceased. At his police interview, Mr. Alas said that he stared at the deceased in this way in order to “le[t] him know like if you do anything, um, I would jump on you” (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 167-68).

g)      When Mr. Alas saw the deceased making a fist directed at the women, he immediately jumped in and stabbed him in the throat, although he said that he “wanted to stab him . . . in his chest” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 171). He stabbed the deceased five more times after that.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the conviction is restored.

English version of the reasons for judgment of the Court delivered by

 

                    Côté J. —

I.               Introduction

[1]                              This appeal affords this Court a first opportunity to interpret s. 669.2(3) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, which lays down the rules that apply if a trial judge dies or is unable to continue when no adjudication has been made or verdict rendered. The key issue concerns the rules of evidence in a trial commenced again before a new judge sitting alone. The parties are asking this Court to rule on the legal framework governing the admissibility in evidence in a trial that is commenced again, as evidence on the merits, of transcripts of testimony from a first trial that have been filed by mutual consent.

[2]                              Section 669.2(3) provides that the judge before whom the proceedings are continued must, if the trial was before a judge alone and no adjudication was made or verdict rendered, commence the trial again as if no evidence on the merits had been taken. However, s. 669.2 says nothing about whether evidence adduced before the first judge may be adduced as evidence on the merits in the trial that is commenced again.

[3]                              Although it is common ground that such evidence can be filed at the trial that is commenced again, the parties disagree on the test to be applied when the prosecution and the accused consent to the filing of a transcript of testimony heard by the judge before whom the trial first commenced. The Quebec Court of Appeal, relying on the rule that testimony is conventionally given orally at trial, proposed a two-part inquiry. First, the court must — even if the accused is represented by counsel — determine whether the consent of the accused is voluntary, informed and unequivocal. Second, the court must ensure that the filing of the evidence will not undermine the fairness of the trial. The appellant, Her Majesty the Queen, has appealed to this Court, arguing that the Court of Appeal erred by requiring an inquiry that is not provided for by law.

[4]                              With all due respect, I conclude that the Court of Appeal erred in its interpretation and application of s. 669.2. There is no reason to require an inquiry that is not provided for by law where the parties have consented to the filing, in a trial that was commenced again, of a transcript of testimony given at a first trial. Such an inquiry would completely alter the judge’s role, minimize the judge’s ability to assess the transcript of prior testimony and run counter to the presumption of the competence of counsel.

[5]                              At the end of the hearing before us, this Court allowed the appeal and restored the convictions and the sentences on counts 1, 2 and 9 to 13, with reasons to follow. These are the reasons.

II.            Background

[6]                              The respondent, J.D., was charged in 2012 with 18 counts of sexual offences involving victims who were minors that were committed between 1974 and 1993. Two of the complainants were his children C.D. and S.D., while the other two were his nephew and niece.

[7]                              The hearing of the prosecution’s evidence began on March 29, 2016 before Judge Valmont Beaulieu of the Court of Québec. C.D., the daughter of the accused, gave her testimony, both in chief and in cross‑examination, on March 29 and 30. On March 30, 2016, the respondent suffered an attack, and the case was postponed for a later date. During the period of the stay of proceedings, Judge Beaulieu fell ill.

[8]                              The case would be postponed several times until, more than a year later, in April 2017, the Court of Québec informed the parties that Judge Beaulieu would be replaced under s. 669.2 of the Criminal Code. A new trial was scheduled to begin on September 18, 2017 before Judge Paul Chevalier.

[9]                              Only C.D. had been heard by the first trial judge. On June 16, 2017, the coordinating judge for the district sent a letter to counsel for the parties that noted their consent to having the transcript of C.D.’s testimony given to the new judge. As a result, counsel for the parties, by common agreement, filed the transcript of C.D.’s testimony in the record. At the opening of the second trial, on September 18, 2017, counsel for the defence reiterated his consent and the transcript of C.D.’s testimony was admitted by Judge Chevalier as evidence on the merits.

III.         Judicial History

A.           Court of Québec, 2017 QCCQ 19515 (Judge Chevalier)

[10]                          In addition to the transcript filed in lieu of testimony of C.D., three other complainants, including S.D., the respondent’s son, testified for the prosecution and described in detail the assaults they had allegedly experienced during their childhood. The assaults recounted by S.D. were corroborated in part by the testimony of C.D., the transcript of which had been filed in the record.

[11]                          After analyzing the whole of the facts for each complainant, Judge Chevalier found the respondent guilty on 9 of the 18 counts, ordered a conditional stay of proceedings on 2 of the counts and acquitted him on 7 other counts, 6 concerning C.D and the only one concerning J.J.D., another of the respondent’s children.

B.            Quebec Court of Appeal, 2020 QCCA 1108 (Dutil, Hamilton and Moore JJ.A.)

[12]                          In the Court of Appeal, five issues with regard to the convictions were stated. Only one of them is relevant to the appeal in this Court: Did the trial judge err in allowing the testimony of C.D., given before another judge, to be filed in the record?

[13]                          Hamilton J.A., writing for a unanimous court, stressed that the rule stated in s. 669.2(3) of the Criminal Code requires the new judge to commence the trial again in its entirety. The Court of Appeal relied on Gauthier v. R., 2020 QCCA 751, and Jetté v. R., 2020 QCCA 750, in which it had ordered new trials in contexts similar to the one in the case at bar. In Gauthier and Jetté, the Court of Appeal had held that the accused may consent to the filing of evidence that was adduced before the first judge. However, the new judge must not accept that the testimony be filed in the record unless satisfied that the consent of the accused is voluntary, informed and unequivocal. The new judge must also be satisfied that filing the evidence that was adduced before the first judge will not undermine the fairness of the trial.

[14]                          The Court of Appeal concluded that [translation] “the trial judge should not have accepted that [C.D.]’s testimony be filed without ensuring that the consent of the [accused] was voluntary, informed and unequivocal and that the filing of [C.D.]’s testimony would not undermine the fairness of the trial” (para. 36 (CanLII)). If he was not satisfied in this regard, he should not have allowed the evidence in question to be filed as evidence on the merits and should have commenced the trial again in its entirety. In the Court of Appeal’s view, even though the evidence adduced before the first judge was limited to C.D.’s testimony, it was important evidence in a case in which credibility was key.

[15]                          The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial on the counts concerning C.D. (counts 1 and 2), but also on those relating to S.D. (counts 9 to 13), because one of the acts alleged against the respondent concerned an incident involving both C.D. and S.D. C.D.’s testimony was a factor relevant to the assessment of the credibility of the respondent and of S.D., because C.D. had contradicted the respondent and corroborated S.D.’s testimony. [translation] “It would therefore be dangerous to affirm the convictions relating to [S.D.] if the trial judge did not hear [C.D.]’s testimony” (para. 41). As a result, a motion to set aside the sentences on counts 1 and 2 with respect to C.D. and on counts 9 to 13 with respect to S.D. was also granted.

[16]                          As for the other two complainants, the incidents in question did not involve C.D., and her testimony was immaterial other than on secondary points. The Court of Appeal affirmed the convictions on counts 14 and 17 in relation to those two complainants. It also affirmed the sentences on these counts.

IV.         Issue

[17]                          This appeal concerns only the counts with respect to C.D. and S.D. and raises only one question: Did the Court of Appeal err in its interpretation and application of s. 669.2 of the Criminal Code by requiring a test that is not provided for by law for assessing the validity of the accused’s consent to the filing, in a second trial, of a transcript of testimony previously given at a first trial?

V.           Analysis

[18]                          The Court of Appeal acknowledged that s. 669.2(3) of the Criminal Code does not preclude the application of the usual rules of evidence: [translation] “despite subsection 669.2(3) Cr.C., the accused may consent to the filing of evidence that was adduced before the first judge” (para. 33). It nonetheless held that the judge at the second trial must conduct a two‑part inquiry. First, that judge must ask whether the consent given by the accused to the filing in evidence of a transcript in lieu of testimony was voluntary, informed and unequivocal. Second, the judge must ensure that admitting prior testimony in evidence will not undermine the fairness of the trial.

[19]                          The inquiry required by the Court of Appeal exceeds the scope of the jurisdictional function of s. 669.2. With respect, I find that the Court of Appeal erred by imposing a test that is not provided for by law. Absent evidence to the contrary, waiver of a procedural right by counsel for an accused is presumed to be intentional.

A.           Section 669.2 of the Criminal Code

[20]                          To answer the question raised by this appeal, a statutory interpretation exercise is required. Section 669.2 reads as follows:

      Continuation of proceedings

      669.2 (1) Subject to this section, where an accused or a defendant is being tried by

      (a) a judge or provincial court judge,

(b) a justice or other person who is, or is a member of, a summary conviction court, or

      (c) a court composed of a judge and jury,

      as the case may be, and the judge, provincial court judge, justice or other person dies or is for any reason unable to continue, the proceedings may be continued before another judge, provincial court judge, justice or other person, as the case may be, who has jurisdiction to try the accused or defendant.

      Where adjudication is made

      (2) Where a verdict was rendered by a jury or an adjudication was made by a judge, provincial court judge, justice or other person before whom the trial was commenced, the judge, provincial court judge, justice or other person before whom the proceedings are continued shall, without further election by an accused, impose the punishment or make the order that is authorized by law in the circumstances.

      If no adjudication made

      (3) Subject to subsections (4) and (5), if the trial was commenced but no adjudication was made or verdict rendered, the judge, provincial court judge, justice or other person before whom the proceedings are continued shall, without further election by an accused, commence the trial again as if no evidence on the merits had been taken.

      If no adjudication made — jury trials

      (4) If a trial that is before a court composed of a judge and a jury was commenced but no adjudication was made or verdict rendered, the judge before whom the proceedings are continued may, without further election by an accused, continue the trial or commence the trial again as if no evidence on the merits had been taken.

      Where trial continued

      (5) Where a trial is continued under paragraph (4)(a) [sic], any evidence that was adduced before a judge referred to in paragraph (1)(c) is deemed to have been adduced before the judge before whom the trial is continued but, where the prosecutor and the accused so agree, any part of that evidence may be adduced again before the judge before whom the trial is continued.

[21]                          Statutory interpretation involves reading the words of a provision “in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament” (E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87, quoted in Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), 1998 CanLII 837 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, and Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 26).

[22]                          The grammatical and ordinary sense of the words of s. 669.2 is clear. Subsections (3) and (4) are in no way ambiguous. The rule of s. 669.2(3), applicable to a trial by judge alone, is strict: the new judge “shall . . . commence the trial again as if no evidence on the merits had been taken”. In the case of a trial by judge and jury, the rule of s. 669.2(4) is much more flexible: the new judge “may . . . continue the trial or commence the trial again as if no evidence on the merits had been taken”.

[23]                          The purpose of this section is to preserve trial fairness. A new judge presiding a jury trial may continue the trial or commence the trial again, whereas a new judge sitting alone is required to commence the trial again. In the first case, the trial can continue without undermining trial fairness, because the “trier of facts”, the jury, is not replaced. The situation is different, however, in the case of a trial by judge alone. Because such a judge is both the judge of the law and the trier of facts, the trial cannot simply be resumed at the same place before a new judge (Gauthier, at para. 55). On the contrary, to require the parties to continue the trial would amount to a breach of procedural fairness.

[24]                          Until the coming into force of a statutory amendment on February 15, 1995, the former s. 669.2 required that the trial be commenced again regardless of whether the trial was by judge alone or by judge and jury. It seems clear from this amendment that Parliament wanted to distinguish the two modes of trial. Parliament’s intention is evident: where a trial is by judge alone and must be commenced again before a new judge, that judge may not require the parties, or one of them, to file evidence from the first trial. The trial must absolutely be commenced again.

[25]                          This section, which is included in Part XX of the Criminal Code, is found in a division entitled “Jurisdiction”. This means that s. 669.2(3) does not preclude the application of the usual rules with respect to the presentation of evidence: it concerns jurisdiction, not evidence.

[26]                          At the outset of the second trial, both the prosecution and the defence are free to proceed as they see fit as regards the presentation of their evidence. The parties may take the conventional approach, the one based on the view that “[t]he law has . . . favoured the evidence of witnesses who give evidence in court because they can be observed” (R. v. Youvarajah, 2013 SCC 41, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 720, at para. 19). But the parties may also elect — usually without having to justify their decision — to proceed by filing transcripts of prior testimony. Indeed, the Court of Appeal recognized this in saying that [translation] “the accused may consent to the filing of evidence that was adduced before the first judge” (para. 33; see also Gauthier, at para. 57; R. v. A.A., 2012 ONSC 3270, at paras. 77‑78 (CanLII)).

[27]                          Yet the Court of Appeal required that the new judge conduct a real inquiry. With respect, I am of the view that it erred by requiring a test that is not provided for by law, as is clear from an analysis of the scheme of the Criminal Code. When Parliament intends to require that a judge conduct an inquiry, it does so explicitly. For example, s. 606(1.1) of the Criminal Code specifically sets out the factors the court must verify before accepting a guilty plea. It is because of the finality of a guilty plea and its extremely serious consequences — the accused forgoes a trial as well as the presentation of the prosecution’s case against him or her — that the judge must ensure the plea is voluntary, unequivocal and informed (R. v. Wong, 2018 SCC 25, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 696, at paras. 2‑3; Dallaire v. R., 2021 QCCA 785, at para. 17 (CanLII)).

[28]                          But there is no justification for transposing such an inquiry to a context like the one in the instant case. Electing to file a transcript of testimony from a previous trial does not have the same implications. Although proceeding in this way is not the conventional approach, it is in no way exceptional. This is a tactical decision that resembles other decisions of the same nature, such as choosing to cross‑examine a witness, consent to certain admissions or waive a voir dire (Park v. The Queen, 1981 CanLII 56 (SCC), [1981] 2 S.C.R. 64, at pp. 73‑75; R. v. White (1997), 1997 CanLII 2426 (ON CA), 32 O.R. (3d) 722 (C.A.), at p. 751). All such decisions can of course have major repercussions on the outcome of a trial, but they do not require preventive intervention by the court. For example, in analogous circumstances, the British Columbia Court of Appeal stated that “[w]here both Crown and defence counsel agree that hearsay evidence is admissible, the judge is not required to embark on an independent inquiry to determine whether their positions are legally sound” (R. v. Verma, 2016 BCCA 220, 336 C.C.C. (3d) 441, at para. 38 (emphasis added)).

[29]                          In sum, this statutory interpretation exercise shows how straightforward the provision is. The only function of s. 669.2(3) is to require a judge sitting alone to commence the trial again. Once the judge has done so, the parties have control over the presentation of their own evidence. Therefore, for the transcript of testimony given at the first trial to be admitted in the second trial as evidence on the merits, all that is needed is that the transcript be duly filed and that the parties consent to its being filed (Matheson v. The Queen, 1981 CanLII 202 (SCC), [1981] 2 S.C.R. 214, at pp. 217‑18).

[30]                          Given that the parties have control over their own evidence, the judge must, absent either circumstances in which the legislation — or the common law — requires an inquiry or any indication to the contrary, presume that the professional experience and judgment of counsel have guided him or her in conducting the case in such a way as to protect the client’s fundamental interests (R. v. G.D.B., 2000 SCC 22, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520, at para. 27; White, at p. 751).

[31]                          Calling evidence necessarily involves making tactical decisions in which the judge need not intervene. Not only does the judge need not do so, but he or she should in fact refrain from intervening. This Court recently noted the deference owed to counsel in regard to tactical decisions made in the best interests of the client:

     . . . our adversarial system does accord a high degree of deference to the tactical decisions of counsel. In other words, while courts may sanction the conduct of the litigants, they should generally refrain from interfering with the conduct of the litigation itself. In R. v. S.G.T., 2010 SCC 20, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 688, at paras. 36‑37, this Court explained why judges should be very cautious before interfering with tactical decisions:

     In an adversarial system of criminal trials, trial judges must, barring exceptional circumstances, defer to the tactical decisions of counsel . . . . [C]ounsel will generally be in a better position to assess the wisdom, in light of their overall trial strategy, of a particular tactical decision than is the trial judge. By contrast, trial judges are expected to be impartial arbiters of the dispute before them; the more a trial judge second‑guesses or overrides the decisions of counsel, the greater is the risk that the trial judge will, in either appearance or reality, cease being a neutral arbiter and instead become an advocate for one party. . . . [Emphasis in original deleted.]

      (R. v. Anderson, 2014 SCC 41, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 167, at para. 59)

[32]                          However, s. 669.2 does not eliminate the judge’s residual discretion (see, by analogy, R. v. R.V., 2019 SCC 41, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 237, at para. 75). As the gatekeeper for trial fairness, the judge retains at all times the power to inquire on his or her own initiative even where doing so is required neither by statute nor at common law. Where there are indications suggesting that the consent of the accused might be vitiated, the court should exercise its residual discretion and investigate further in order to ensure that the consent of the accused to the procedure is voluntary and informed (Gauthier; Jetté).

[33]                          Gauthier is of some interest in this regard. In that case, the defence had announced — after all the evidence had been called and all that remained was to render the verdict — that the accused could not afford to have the trial commence again in its entirety owing to a lack of financial resources. In this way, the accused was consenting to all the transcripts from the first trial being filed as evidence on the merits before the judge charged with commencing the trial again and rendering judgment. The Court of Appeal, having indications before it that suggested that the consent of the accused had not been voluntary and informed, ordered a new trial. Because the trial judge had not inquired further into the consent of the accused, the fairness of the trial had been undermined. This leads to the inference that had there been no such indications, an inquiry would probably not have been necessary.

[34]                          Before concluding, I emphasize that the accused in the case at bar was represented by counsel. This Court is therefore not required to determine whether the trial judge’s duty to a self‑represented accused would be different. Allow me nonetheless to digress by making a few comments, although without ruling definitively on this issue. In the case of a self‑represented accused, the court has a duty to ensure that the accused can have a fair trial that is respectful of his or her fundamental rights. The judge is at that time [translation] “charged with a particular responsibility” to ensure that the trial is fair (R. v. Leblanc, 2010 QCCA 1891, 78 C.R. (6th) 359, at para. 47). The judge has, in this sense, a duty to assist the accused (Guenette v. R., 2002 CanLII 7883 (Que. C.A.), at para. 20; R. v. Richards, 2017 ONCA 424, 349 C.C.C. (3d) 284, at para. 110). This duty to assist is [translation] “variable”, however, as it differs according to the circumstances and is limited to what is reasonable (M.R. v. R., 2018 QCCA 1983, 53 C.R. (7th) 182, at para. 25, citing Jarrah v. R., 2017 QCCA 1869, and R. v. Breton, 2018 ONCA 753, 366 C.C.C. (3d) 281, at para. 13; see also Richards, at paras. 110‑11). Although the court is not required to give advice to the accused, it must be reasonably certain that the accused is aware of his or her procedural rights. It could be necessary in such circumstances to inquire further into the consent of the accused. I will now return to the matter at hand.

[35]                          In sum, s. 669.2(3) does not bar a transcript of testimony given at a first trial from being filed as evidence on the merits in a second trial, nor does it require an inquiry by the judge in this regard. Nevertheless, s. 669.2 does not eliminate the judge’s power not to allow a transcript to be filed if he or she finds that the prejudicial effect of filing it would undermine the fairness of the trial. A judge who finds that trial fairness is undermined must intervene.

[36]                          Let us now turn to the situation in this case.

B.            Application

[37]                          The trial did in fact commence again before Judge Chevalier. He did not unilaterally require the parties to file the transcripts from the first trial. As I mentioned above, for the transcript of C.D.’s testimony to be admitted in evidence, all that was needed was that the transcript be duly filed and that the parties consent to its being filed. Both these conditions were met in this case. The respondent’s second trial was fair.

[38]                          First, I note that it was the prosecution, not the defence, that decided — despite the weaknesses of C.D.’s testimony — not to enhance its evidence and not to call her to testify again. If the prosecution had decided to call C.D. again, the accused could not have objected to that, as she was a witness for the prosecution.

[39]                          Second, the accused was in no way obligated to consent to the filing of the transcript of C.D.’s testimony. Consenting to the filing of the transcript was a tactical decision, and I would add that this tactic seems to have worked, given that the accused was acquitted on six of the eight counts with respect to C.D.

[40]                          If the accused had refused to consent to the filing of the transcript of C.D.’s testimony, the prosecution would have had no choice but to have C.D. testify again (there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the prosecution could not have called her again) or to abandon that evidence. As well, Judge Chevalier could not himself have forced the accused to consent to the filing of the transcript as evidence on the merits, especially given that no exception to the hearsay rule had been raised. What is more, the accused could have withdrawn his consent either before Judge Chevalier or on appeal by claiming, for example, ineffective assistance of his counsel.

[41]                          But that did not happen. In all likelihood, the accused, on his counsel’s advice, considered that it was to his advantage to consent to the filing of the transcript. I would add that at no time did the accused cast any doubt on his consent to proceeding in this way. It was not even included among his grounds of appeal in the Court of Appeal. Before being invited by the Court of Appeal to make submissions on this point, the accused never suggested that his consent to the filing of the transcript of C.D.’s testimony was vitiated or, at the very least, that he had changed his mind.

[42]                          Contrary to the situation in Gauthier, there were no indications in the instant case that might have led Judge Chevalier to question the consent of the accused. When he received the parties’ consent, he was satisfied that the fairness of the trial was assured. The fact that Judge Chevalier presumed that the consent of the accused was valid does not constitute procedural unfairness. On the contrary, it is consistent with the guiding principles of criminal procedure.

[43]                          Furthermore, the Court of Appeal erred in concluding that, because the transcript of C.D.’s testimony was [translation] “important evidence in a case in which credibility was key”, Judge Chevalier should not have admitted it without ensuring that the respondent’s consent was voluntary, informed and unequivocal and that its filing would not undermine the fairness of the trial (para. 37). Conducting a defence necessarily involves making tactical decisions in which the judge need not intervene, especially when the accused is duly represented by counsel. The fact that credibility is in issue changes nothing in this case.

[44]                          As the appellant explains, [translation] “[t]he effect of the Court of Appeal’s decision is that it is hard, if not impossible, to imagine a case in which the judge before whom a trial commences again can admit in evidence a transcript of testimony of a victim of a crime whose credibility is in issue. Only ancillary testimony would be compatible with the stated conditions. The Court of Appeal is practically prohibiting an accused from consenting to the filing of such evidence upon the resumption of the trial” (A.F., at para. 48).

[45]                          As to the counts with respect to S.D., I find that the Court of Appeal also erred in ordering a new trial solely on the basis that C.D.’s testimony was a relevant factor in the assessment of the acts committed against S.D.

[46]                        C.D.’s testimony was not necessary in order to find the accused guilty on the counts involving S.D. In assessing the evidence with respect to S.D., Judge Chevalier used the transcript of C.D.’s testimony to only a limited extent. And that limited use did not have the effect of vitiating all of the findings of fact (independent of C.D.’s testimony) Judge Chevalier reached.

[47]                        It is clear from Judge Chevalier’s reasons that he was satisfied, independently of C.D.’s corroboration — which, as I said, was not necessary — that the assaults alleged by S.D. actually took place. Judge Chevalier stated that he believed S.D. [translation] “because of the consistency between what he said and the accounts he had given previously, because of the lack of any sort of collusion with his sister, whom he even contradicted at times, and because of the objectivity he displayed in testifying, despite the contradictions by the accused and Ms. G., regarding the photos in particular” (para. 115 (CanLII)). Judge Chevalier then added that he “believes [S.D.]’s testimony and is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the other types of sexual assault he experienced . . . the descriptions of which are very detailed, took place” (para. 118). As a result, [translation] “[t]his limited corroboration could not cast doubt on the conclusion concerning S.D.’s credibility” (A.F., at para. 104).

[48]                          In sum, because the parties had agreed to proceed with the filing of the transcript of C.D.’s testimony, Judge Chevalier had only to determine the weight to be given to it. The absence of C.D. at trial goes to the weight of her testimony, not to its admissibility (R. v. Hawkins, 1996 CanLII 154 (SCC), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1043, at para. 79). The Court of Appeal should not have questioned the valid consent of the accused, which resulted from the exercise of reasonable professional judgment. That tactical decision by his counsel “[fell] within the wide latitude afforded counsel in the conduct of the case” (I.F., at para. 13).

[49]                          In conclusion, I must specify that it would not be appropriate to remand the appeal to the Court of Appeal. The accused has appealed to this Court on only a single issue and has neither reiterated nor stressed the other grounds he raised in the Court of Appeal. To return the case to that court would not be an efficient use of judicial resources.

VI.         Conclusion

[50]                          I would allow the appeal. The convictions and the sentences on counts 1, 2 and 9 to 13 are restored.

 

                    Appeal allowed.

                     Moldaver J. —

I.               Introduction

[1]                             Patrick Dussault was arrested on charges of murder and arson. He was read his rights and taken to the police station, where he spoke with a lawyer for roughly 10 minutes on the telephone. He and the lawyer ended the call in the belief that the police had agreed to allow them to continue their conversation at the station. When the lawyer came to the station, the police did not let him meet with Mr. Dussault. Before Mr. Dussault spoke again with the lawyer, he was questioned and made an incriminating statement.

[2]                             At issue in this appeal is whether the police provided Mr. Dussault with a reasonable opportunity to consult counsel and, more particularly, whether they were required to provide Mr. Dussault with a further opportunity to consult counsel before interrogating him. The trial judge held that they were not required to do so because, in all the circumstances, they could reasonably presume that Mr. Dussault had exercised his right to counsel during the 10-minute telephone call with his lawyer. The Court of Appeal reached the opposite conclusion, holding that Mr. Dussault’s telephone call did not constitute a “complete” consultation for the purposes of s. 10(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and that the police were required to allow Mr. Dussault to continue this consultation at the station.

[3]                             For reasons that I will explain, in the unique circumstances of this case, I am satisfied that the police were required to provide Mr. Dussault with a further opportunity to consult counsel before questioning him. My reasons for reaching that conclusion, however, differ from those of the Court of Appeal. In my opinion, there were objectively observable indicators that the police conduct in this case had the effect of undermining the legal advice that the lawyer provided to Mr. Dussault during their telephone call. Therefore, even if the call was a complete consultation in its own right, the police were nevertheless required to provide Mr. Dussault with a second opportunity to consult counsel. They failed to do so and thereby breached his s. 10(b) rights. I would dismiss the appeal.

II.            Facts

[4]                             The facts as summarized are based on findings made by the trial judge.

[5]                             On the afternoon of August 28, 2013, Gatineau police made a dynamic entry into the home of Mr. Dussault and arrested him on charges of murder and arson. The police informed Mr. Dussault of his rights, including his right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter. Mr. Dussault indicated that he wished to speak to a lawyer.

[6]                             The police transported Mr. Dussault to the police station. They arrived at 2:36 p.m. Mr. Dussault was presented with a list of local defence lawyers. He chose Jean-François Benoît at random. He was placed in a small room with a telephone and told to wait for a call. When the phone rang, Mr. Dussault answered. Mr. Benoît was on the line.

[7]                             The two conversed for roughly nine minutes. Mr. Benoît explained the charges and Mr. Dussault’s right to remain silent. He was left with the impression that Mr. Dussault was not processing or understanding his advice. He offered to come to the station to meet in person, and Mr. Dussault accepted. Mr. Benoît then asked Mr. Dussault to pass the phone to an officer. Mr. Dussault knocked on the door and handed the receiver to Detective Sergeant Pierre Chicoine.

[8]                             Mr. Benoît spoke with Officer Chicoine for roughly three minutes. He said that he was coming to the police station and asked that the investigation be suspended. Officer Chicoine responded [translation] “[n]o problem” or “no trouble”: A.R., vol. V, at p. 141, and vol. VIII, at p. 18. Mr. Benoît asked Officer Chicoine to return the phone to Mr. Dussault.

[9]                             Mr. Benoît spoke again with Mr. Dussault for roughly one minute. He confirmed that he was coming to the police station to meet with Mr. Dussault and he explained that, in the interim, Mr. Dussault would be placed in a cell. He told Mr. Dussault not to speak to anyone. Mr. Dussault was reassured by this conversation. He believed that Mr. Benoît was coming to meet him.

[10]                        At 3:20 p.m., Officer Chicoine, accompanied by Detective Sergeant Ian Gosselin, spoke to the lead investigators on the file, reporting that the arrest went well and that Mr. Dussault had exercised his right to counsel. During the conversation, it was decided that Mr. Benoît would not be permitted to meet with Mr. Dussault. Officer Chicoine was told to inform Mr. Benoît of this decision.

[11]                        In line with these instructions, Officer Chicoine phoned Mr. Benoît and told him that there was no point in coming to the police station. He said that Mr. Dussault had exercised his right to counsel during the telephone conversation. He also emphasized that Mr. Dussault himself had not expressed a desire to meet his lawyer. According to Officer Chicoine, Mr. Benoît responded in a loud voice, seemingly attempting to influence or intimidate him.

[12]                        After this call, Officer Chicoine began to doubt himself. He reported to a lead investigator, who decided that a prosecutor from the office of the Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions should be contacted for advice. The prosecutor researched relevant case law, including this Court’s decision in R. v. Sinclair, 2010 SCC 35, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 310. She concluded, based on the information provided to her, that Mr. Dussault was not entitled to meet with Mr. Benoît at the police station, and she advised the police accordingly.

[13]                        Mr. Benoît arrived at the police station at approximately 4:15 p.m. He was not permitted to meet with Mr. Dussault. At 6:30 p.m., he left to tend to family matters, leaving behind a handwritten note addressed to Officer Chicoine. In the note, Mr. Benoît indicated that, during his phone call with Mr. Dussault, he had only partially instructed Mr. Dussault on his rights, and that he wished to meet with Mr. Dussault to complete the advice before Mr. Dussault was interrogated. He stated that he would be available after 7:45 p.m. and asked Officer Chicoine to contact him as soon as possible. The note was delivered to Officer Chicoine.

[14]                        At 5:18 p.m. and again at 8:50 p.m., Officers Chicoine and Gosselin approached the cellblock supervisor to ask whether Mr. Dussault had spoken about his lawyer. The answer on both occasions was no.

[15]                        After their second check-in with the cellblock supervisor, the officers went to Mr. Dussault’s cell. At 8:52 p.m., Officer Chicoine told Mr. Dussault that Detective Sergeant Frédérick Simard was ready to meet with him. Mr. Dussault asked whether his [translation] “lawyer arrived”: A.R., vol. V, at p. 183. Officer Chicoine responded with his own question: Was it Mr. Dussault who had asked the lawyer to come? Mr. Dussault answered that it was the lawyer who said that he would come, and that the lawyer wanted to be there during the meeting. Officer Chicoine told Mr. Dussault that the lawyer was not at the police station.

[16]                        Officer Simard commenced the interrogation shortly before 9:00 p.m. Mr. Dussault could not understand why he had not yet spoken to his lawyer. It is worth reproducing in full a number of the questions and responses between Officer Simard and Mr. Dussault on this subject:

[translation]

 

Q. . . . [O]nce you were arrested, at 12 Trottier, is it true that [Detective Sergeant Chicoine is] the same man who brought you here, who read you your rights?

 

A. Yes.

 

Q. He had that form, in fact it’s a copy of his form.

 

A. That, my lawyer told me he was supposed to be here because he wanted to attend this interview, and he isn’t here, and they told me . . . he told me to wait till he was here, and he still hasn’t arrived.

 

Q. OK. We’re going to clarify that actually, that step, whether you got your rights with Mr. Chicoine. . . .

 

 

. . .

 

Q. OK. Well, I’ll tell you. We’re a team here, it’s like a big family. So how did things go with those two people, those two police officers?

 

A. It was fine.

 

Q. Yes?

 

A. But that, my lawyer, he told me to . . . why did he tell me to remain . . . He just told me to give my name, my things, and he told me to remain silent until he was here. Why did he tell me that?

 

Q. Why did he tell you that? He gave you advice, and it’s privileged for you.

 

A. No, I know.

 

Q. I can’t get involved in that conversation.

 

A. Yeah.

 

Q. It’s because it’s your privilege to consult a lawyer.

 

A. Because he told me he’d be here. Now I feel like I’m a bit on my own. He told me he’d be here to come . . .

 

. . .

 

Q. But what I want to clarify is: did you have a chance to speak to a lawyer?

 

A. Yes.

 

Q. Who was your lawyer?

 

A. It’s . . . fuck, I don’t have the name, but he’s . . .

 

Q. If I tell you Mr. Benoît?

 

A. Yes.

 

Q. That’s right?

 

A. Yes.

 

Q. Were you able to speak to him in confidence, alone?

 

A. Yes, and he told me to remain silent until he met with me.

 

. . .

 

Q. . . . So the right to counsel, I’m happy, you were able to exercise your right, that’s perfect. You got advice and that’s the number one thing. I will set that aside. [Underlining added.]

 

(A.R., vol. X, at pp. 10-11 and 14-17)

[17]                          After these exchanges, the interrogation proceeded, and Mr. Dussault made an incriminating statement.

III.         Decisions Below

A.           Voir Dire, Superior Court of Quebec (Di Salvo J.)

[18]                        Mr. Dussault moved to exclude the statement on the basis that it was obtained in violation of ss. 7, 10(a), and 10(b) of the Charter. Only the last of these alleged violations is at issue in the present appeal.

[19]                        Defence counsel argued that Sinclair, and in particular para. 52 of this case, was the principal governing authority:

[translation] So we’ll get to the heart of the matter. And here I quote paragraph fifty-two (52), copying my friend. Paragraph fifty-two (52):

 

“More broadly, this may be taken to suggest that circumstances indicating that the detainee may not have understood the initial section ten (b) (10(b)) advice of his right to counsel impose on the police a duty to give him a further opportunity to talk to a lawyer.”

 

(A.R., vol. IX, at p. 67)

[20]                        Counsel argued that there had been objectively observable circumstances indicating that Mr. Dussault had not understood Mr. Benoît’s initial legal advice. Two such circumstances stood out. The first was Mr. Benoît’s handwritten note, and the second was Mr. Dussault’s statement to the effect that his lawyer had said he was coming to meet with him. In counsel’s view, these circumstances obliged the police to provide Mr. Dussault with a second opportunity to consult with Mr. Benoît.

[21]                        The trial judge rejected this argument and held that the incriminating statement was admissible. She made three significant findings in support of this conclusion:

•         first, that Mr. Benoît adequately explained the right to silence;

•         second, that Mr. Dussault understood Mr. Benoît’s explanation of the right to silence;

•         third, that Mr. Dussault did not mention to police that he did not understand the right to silence or his rights more generally.

Based on these conclusions, and in consideration of all the evidence, the trial judge found that Mr. Dussault had exercised his right to counsel, and that the police [translation] “could reasonably assume” that he had done so in a satisfactory manner: voir dire decision, reproduced in A.R., vol. I, at p. 19. They were not obligated to provide a second opportunity.

B.            Court of Appeal of Quebec, 2020 QCCA 746, 388 C.C.C. (3d) 362 (Bich, Bouchard and Healy JJ.A.)

[22]                        Mr. Dussault pled guilty to the charge of arson and was convicted by a jury on the charge of second degree murder. He appealed from the murder conviction on the basis that the trial judge erred in dismissing his motion to exclude the incriminating statement. The Court of Appeal unanimously allowed the appeal, quashed the verdict, and ordered a new trial.

[23]                        The central issue, as framed by the Court of Appeal, was whether Mr. Dussault’s telephone call with Mr. Benoît constituted a complete consultation for the purposes of s. 10(b). If the answer was yes, the Sinclair framework would govern the appeal; Mr. Dussault could succeed only by showing that an objectively observable change in circumstances had “reviv[ed]” his right to counsel: para. 38. If, however, the telephone conversation was not a complete consultation, the Court of Appeal’s decision in Stevens v. R., 2016 QCCA 1707, would govern the outcome. The Court of Appeal in this case interpreted Stevens as standing for the proposition that s. 10(b) guarantees the right to, and requires police to facilitate, the “effective” assistance of counsel: para. 36.

[24]                        The court concluded that the telephone conversation was not a complete consultation and that the police “were fully aware that [Mr. Dussault] and his counsel expected the consultation to continue”: para. 35. The police denied the effective assistance of counsel, and thereby breached Mr. Dussault’s s. 10(b) right, when they “determined not to permit a continuation of the consultation that began on the telephone”: para. 36. The court excluded Mr. Dussault’s incriminating statement under s. 24(2) of the Charter and ordered a new trial.

[25]                        The reasons of the Court of Appeal depart markedly from those of the trial judge in terms of their characterization of the conduct of the police. Whereas the trial judge concluded that the police could reasonably presume that Mr. Dussault had exercised his right to counsel, the Court of Appeal found that the police had deliberately and concertedly attempted to frustrate the effective exercise of that right: see, e.g., para. 40. This difference in view of the police conduct appears to result from their different legal conclusions about whether the police were entitled to presume that the right to counsel was exhausted at the end of the phone conversation.

IV.         Analysis

[26]                        The only issue in this appeal is whether the factual findings of the trial judge support the legal conclusion that the police provided Mr. Dussault with a reasonable opportunity to consult counsel. This calls for an assessment of whether a legal standard was met and therefore amounts to a question of law that is reviewed for correctness: R. v. Shepherd, 2009 SCC 35, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 527, at para. 20.

[27]                        In my opinion, the police failed to provide Mr. Dussault with a reasonable opportunity to consult counsel. I would therefore dismiss the appeal. My reasons for reaching this conclusion, however, differ from those of the Court of Appeal.

[28]                        For reasons which will become apparent, I find it unnecessary to decide whether the police were entitled to presume that the phone conversation constituted a “complete” consultation. Nor is it necessary to resolve the discrepancy between the characterization of the police conduct in the reasons of the trial judge and those of the Court of Appeal. Suffice it to say that I have serious reservations about the Court of Appeal’s characterization of the police conduct to the extent that it could be understood as suggesting that the police knowingly violated Mr. Dussault’s right to counsel.

[29]                        As I see it, the principles set out in Sinclair suffice to resolve this appeal. Sinclair states that the police must provide a detainee with a second opportunity to consult counsel where there are “objectively observable” indicators that their conduct has undermined the legal advice that was provided during the first consultation: para. 55. On the facts of the present appeal, there were objectively observable indicators that the conduct of the police had had the effect of undermining the legal advice that Mr. Benoît provided to Mr. Dussault during their telephone call. Therefore, even if the call was a complete consultation, this was one of those rare cases in which the police were obligated to provide a detainee with a second opportunity to consult counsel. In failing to provide that opportunity to Mr. Dussault, they breached his s. 10(b) rights.

A.           The Legal Principles

(1)         Sinclair and the Right to a Second Consultation

[30]                        Section 10(b) of the Charter provides that everyone has the right on arrest or detention “to retain and instruct counsel without delay and to be informed of that right”. Stated at its broadest, the purpose of the right to counsel “is to provide a detainee with an opportunity to obtain legal advice relevant to his legal situation”: Sinclair, at para. 24.

[31]                        Section 10(b) places corresponding obligations on the state. Police must inform detainees of the right to counsel (the informational duty) and must provide detainees who invoke this right with a reasonable opportunity to exercise it (the implementational duty). Failure to comply with either duty results in a breach of s. 10(b): Sinclair, at para. 27, citing R. v. Manninen, 1987 CanLII 67 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1233.

[32]                        Police can typically discharge their implementational duty by facilitating “a single consultation at the time of detention or shortly thereafter”: Sinclair, at para. 47. In this context, the consultation is meant to ensure that “the detainee’s decision to cooperate with the investigation or decline to do so is free and informed”: para. 26. A few minutes on the phone with a lawyer may suffice, even for very serious charges: see, e.g., R. v. Willier, 2010 SCC 37, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 429.

[33]                        On this point, it is worth reiterating what the Sinclair majority made clear: Detainees do not have a right to obtain, and police do not have a duty to facilitate, the continuous assistance of counsel. Although other jurisdictions recognize a right to have counsel present throughout a police interview, that is not the law in Canada. Canadian courts and legislatures have taken a different approach to reconciling the personal rights of detainees with the public interest in effective law enforcement: Sinclair, at paras. 37‑39.

[34]                        Once a detainee has consulted with counsel, the police are entitled to begin eliciting evidence and are only exceptionally obligated to provide a further opportunity to receive legal advice. In Sinclair, McLachlin C.J. and Charron J., writing for the majority, explained that the law has thus far recognized three categories of “changed circumstances” that can renew a detainee’s right to consult counsel: “. . . new procedures involving the detainee; a change in the jeopardy facing the detainee; or reason to believe that the first information provided was deficient” (para. 2). Of course, for any of these “changed circumstances” to give rise to a right to reconsult, they must be “objectively observable”.

[35]                        As a specific example of the third category listed above, the majority explained, at para. 52, that the right to counsel may be renewed if police “undermine” the legal advice that the detainee has received:

Similarly, if the police undermine the legal advice that the detainee has received, this may have the effect of distorting or nullifying it. This undercuts the purpose of s. 10(b). In order to counteract this effect, it has been found necessary to give the detainee a further right to consult counsel. See [R. v.] Burlingham[, 1995 CanLII 88 (SCC), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 206].

(2)         Undermining Legal Advice Includes Undermining Confidence in Counsel

[36]                        The majority in Sinclair did not expand on the type of police conduct that could “undermine the legal advice that the detainee has received” and thereby give rise to a renewed right to consult counsel. In this context, care must be taken in defining the term “undermine”. It is clear, for instance, that if this term is defined too broadly, it would prevent police from attempting in any way to convince a detainee to act contrary to their lawyer’s advice: see, e.g., R. v. Edmondson, 2005 SKCA 51, 257 Sask. R. 270, at para. 37. If this were so, police would effectively be required to cease questioning any detainee who said “my lawyer told me not to talk”. That is not the law in Canada: R. v. Singh, 2007 SCC 48, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 405.

[37]                        The reference to Burlingham at the end of para. 52 in Sinclair sheds light on the type of police conduct that can “undermine” legal advice in the Sinclair sense of that term. It suggests that, in this context, police can undermine legal advice by undermining confidence in the lawyer who provided that advice. In Burlingham, the accused was charged with one murder and suspected in a second. He was subjected to an intensive interrogation during which police repeatedly disparaged “defence counsel’s loyalty, commitment, availability, as well as the amount of his legal fees”: para. 4. A majority of the Court found that these “belittling” comments breached s. 10(b) because they were made with the purpose, or had the effect, of undermining the accused’s confidence in counsel:

. . . s. 10(b) specifically prohibits the police, as they did in this case, from belittling an accused’s lawyer with the express goal or effect of undermining the accused’s confidence in and relationship with defence counsel. It makes no sense for s. 10(b) of the Charter to provide for the right to retain and instruct counsel if law enforcement authorities are able to undermine either an accused’s confidence in his or her lawyer or the solicitor-client relationship. [para. 14]

[38]                        It is notable that Burlingham speaks of undermining confidence in counsel, whereas Sinclair speaks specifically of undermining legal advice. The implied premise of the Sinclair citation to Burlingham appears to be that undermining confidence in counsel and undermining legal advice, in this context, produce the same effect. I agree, they can.

[39]                        A detainee’s confidence in counsel anchors the solicitor-client relationship and allows for the effective provision of legal advice: R. v. McCallen (1999), 1999 CanLII 3685 (ON CA), 43 O.R. (3d) 56 (C.A.). When the police undermine a detainee’s confidence in counsel, the legal advice that counsel has already provided — even if it was perfectly correct at the time it was given — may become, as observed in Sinclair, “distort[ed] or nullif[ied]”. Sinclair requires police to provide a new opportunity to consult with counsel in order to counteract these effects.

(3)         “Undermining” Is Not Limited to Intentional Belittling of Defence Counsel

[40]                        The most notable cases in this area of the law are those, such as Burlingham, in which the police expressly call into question the competence or trustworthiness of defence counsel. Burlingham and certain cases following it have characterized this type of conduct as the “belittling” of defence counsel. In cases of this sort, it is difficult to view the police conduct as amounting to anything less than an intentional effort to undermine the legal advice provided to a detainee.

[41]                        The Sinclair analysis does not, however, distinguish between intentional and unintentional undermining of legal advice. The focus remains on the effects of the police conduct. Where the police conduct has the effect of undermining the legal advice given to a detainee, and where it is objectively observable that this has occurred, the right to a second consultation arises. There is no need to prove that the police conduct was intended to have this effect.

[42]                        This conclusion follows from a consideration of the basic principles that underlie the Sinclair framework. Sinclair mandates that police provide a second opportunity to consult counsel where “changed circumstances suggest that reconsultation is necessary in order for the detainee to have the information relevant to choosing whether to cooperate with the police investigation or not”: para. 48. To focus on whether the police intended to bring about a change in circumstance would be to shift the inquiry away from the necessity for reconsultation and toward the fault of the police. This would distort Sinclair. The duty to facilitate reconsultation is not imposed on police as a punishment for ill-intentioned conduct.

[43]                        The case law also demonstrates that police conduct can unintentionally undermine the legal advice provided to a detainee: see, e.g., R. v. Daley, 2015 ONSC 7145, at para. 42 (CanLII), per Fairburn J. (as she then was); R. v. McGregor, 2020 ONSC 4802, at para. 194 (CanLII); R. v. Taylor, 2016 BCSC 1956, at para. 54 (CanLII). It is for this reason that the Court of Appeal for Ontario was correct to warn that “police tread on dangerous ground when they comment on the legal advice tendered to detainees”: R. v. Mujku, 2011 ONCA 64, 226 C.R.R. (2d) 234, at para. 36. The ground sometimes gives way, and the prohibited effect occurs, even where the intention to achieve it was absent.

[44]                        Nor is there any principled reason to think that police conduct must amount to the “belittling” of defence counsel in order to “undermine” legal advice in the Sinclair sense of that term. Recall that Sinclair described the “undermin[ing]” of legal advice as being conduct which “may have the effect of distorting or nullifying [that advice]”: para. 52 (emphasis added). Conduct other than the express belittlement of defence counsel may have this effect: see, e.g., R. v. Azonwanna, 2020 ONSC 5416, 468 C.R.R. (2d) 258, at paras. 122 and 148-49, in which police undermined the legal advice that a detainee had received by providing a misleading and incorrect summary of his right to silence. There would be no point, however, in trying to catalogue the various types of police conduct that could have the effect of “undermin[ing]” legal advice in this context. The focus remains on the objectively observable effects of the police conduct, rather than on the conduct itself.

[45]                        Simply put, the purpose of s. 10(b) is to provide the detainee with an opportunity to obtain legal advice relevant to their legal situation. As noted earlier, the legal advice is intended to ensure that “the detainee’s decision to cooperate with the investigation or decline to do so is free and informed”. The legal advice received by a detainee can fulfill this function only if the detainee regards it as legally correct and trustworthy. The purpose of s. 10(b) will be frustrated by police conduct that causes the detainee to doubt the legal correctness of the advice they have received or the trustworthiness of the lawyer who provided it. Police conduct of this sort is properly said to “undermine” the legal advice that the detainee has received. If there are objectively observable indicators that the legal advice provided to a detainee has been undermined, the right to a second consultation arises. By contrast, the right to reconsult will not be triggered by legitimate police tactics that persuade a detainee to cooperate without undermining the advice that they have received. As Sinclair makes clear, police tactics such as “revealing (actual or fake) evidence to the detainee in order to demonstrate or exaggerate the strength of the case against him” do not trigger the right to a second consultation with counsel: para. 60.

B.            Application

[46]                        I am satisfied that the police conduct in this case had the effect of leading Mr. Dussault to believe, first, that an in-person consultation with Mr. Benoît would occur and, second, that Mr. Benoît had failed to come to the police station for that consultation. The effect of this was to undermine the legal advice that Mr. Benoît had provided to Mr. Dussault during their telephone conversation. Importantly, there were objectively observable indicators of this. In my view, these indicators triggered the police duty to provide Mr. Dussault with a second opportunity to consult counsel. The police failed to discharge that duty and, in doing so, breached Mr. Dussault’s right to counsel.

(1)         The Police Misled Mr. Dussault

[47]                        In my opinion, two separate acts of Officer Chicoine combined to have the effect of undermining the legal advice provided by Mr. Benoît.

[48]                        The first act occurred during Officer Chicoine’s first telephone conversation with Mr. Benoît. When Mr. Benoît said that he was coming to the police station to meet with Mr. Dussault and asked that the investigation be suspended, Officer Chicoine responded that this would be no problem or no trouble. In reasonable reliance on Officer Chicoine’s words, Mr. Benoît advised Mr. Dussault that he was coming to the police station to meet with him and that, in the interim, he would be placed in a cell. Officer Chicoine’s words therefore had the effect, albeit indirect, of causing Mr. Dussault to believe that an in-person meeting would take place.

[49]                        The second act occurred at 8:52 p.m. By this time, Mr. Benoît had come and gone. When Officer Chicoine told Mr. Dussault that Officer Simard was ready to meet with him, Mr. Dussault asked point-blank whether his [translation] “lawyer arrived”. Officer Chicoine responded that Mr. Benoît [translation] “isn’t at the front of the station”: A.R., vol. VI, at p. 38.

[50]                        In oral argument before this Court, counsel for the Crown insisted that this was [translation] “a particularly delicate situation” for Officer Chicoine: transcript, at p. 9. Counsel stated that Officer Chicoine could not tell Mr. Dussault that Mr. Benoît had come and gone without risking [translation] “a certain denigration of the lawyer’s work”: p. 8. In response to this statement, counsel was asked whether it would not have been simpler for Officer Chicoine to tell Mr. Dussault that it was the police who had prevented Mr. Benoît from meeting with him. Counsel responded that this might have cast [translation] “doubt on the quality of the advice” that Mr. Dussault had received: p. 9. Counsel was evidently of the opinion that Officer Chicoine averted these risks by telling Mr. Dussault that Mr. Benoît [translation] “isn’t at the front of the station”.

[51]                        I do not agree that Officer Chicoine successfully extricated himself from this delicate situation. The most reasonable interpretation of Officer Chicoine’s response was that Mr. Benoît had not arrived at all. Indeed, Mr. Dussault’s statements during the interrogation indicate that this is precisely what he believed ([translation] “he told me to wait till he was here, and he still hasn’t arrived”). Officer Chicoine’s statement misled Mr. Dussault into believing that Mr. Benoît had failed to come to the station for their in-person consultation. If Officer Chicoine was worried about denigrating counsel or casting a doubt on the quality of the legal advice that Mr. Dussault had received, I fail to see how the words that he chose were an improvement over telling Mr. Dussault that Mr. Benoît had come and gone.

(2)         The Police Conduct Undermined the Legal Advice Provided to Mr. Dussault

[52]                        Two factors in particular support my conclusion that the above-described police conduct had the effect of undermining the legal advice that Mr. Benoît had provided to Mr. Dussault.

[53]                        The first is the content of the advice itself. Mr. Benoît advised Mr. Dussault that he was coming to the police station to meet with him in person; that, in the interim, Mr. Dussault would be placed in his cell; and that he — Mr. Dussault — should not speak to anyone. In refusing to permit Mr. Benoît to meet with Mr. Dussault, the police effectively falsified an important premise of Mr. Benoît’s advice — i.e. that Mr. Dussault would be placed in a cell until Mr. Benoît arrived. This is an example of the “distort[ion]” of legal advice that was warned against in Sinclair.

[54]                        The second is the evidence of what Mr. Dussault said during the interrogation itself. He repeatedly expressed that his lawyer had told him he would be there ([translation] “That, my lawyer told me he was supposed to be here”); he stated his belief that his lawyer had never actually arrived (“he told me to wait till he was here, and he still hasn’t arrived”); he openly questioned why his lawyer had given him the advice that he had given (“But that, my lawyer, he told me to . . . why did he tell me to remain . . . He just told me to give my name, my things, and he told me to remain silent until he was here. Why did he tell me that?”); and he implied that his lawyer’s failure to show up had left him feeling alone (“Because he told me he’d be here. Now I feel like I’m a bit on my own”).

[55]                        When these statements are considered in their totality and in light of all relevant circumstances, it is clear that they were objectively observable indicators that the legal advice given to Mr. Dussault had been undermined.

[56]                        In R. v. Rover, 2018 ONCA 745, 143 O.R. (3d) 135, Doherty J.A. described the right to counsel as a “lifeline” through which detained persons obtain legal advice and “the sense that they are not entirely at the mercy of the police while detained”: para. 45; see also R. v. Tremblay, 2021 QCCA 24, at para. 40 (CanLII). I agree. In this case, the conduct of the police had the effect of undermining and distorting the advice that Mr. Dussault had received. The police ought to have offered him a second opportunity to re-establish his “lifeline”, but they did not. In failing to do so, they breached his s. 10(b) rights.

C.            Remedy

[57]                        The Crown has conceded, in my view properly, that Mr. Dussault’s incriminating statement should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter if it was obtained in violation of s. 10(b).

V.           Disposition

[58]                        For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

 

                    Appeal dismissed.

English version of the judgment of Wagner C.J. and Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Brown, Rowe, Martin, Kasirer and Jamal JJ. delivered by

 

                    The Chief Justice —

[1]                              In R. v. Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631, this Court delivered a clear message to all participants in the criminal justice system in Canada: everyone must take proactive measures to prevent delay and to uphold the right to be tried within a reasonable time guaranteed to an accused by s. 11(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. By creating ceilings beyond which trial delay is presumptively unreasonable, the Court developed a prospective approach that allows the various participants to know, from the outset of the proceedings, the temporal limits within which the trial must take place.

[2]                              This appeal affords the Court an opportunity to decide whether the Jordan framework applies when a motion for a stay of proceedings for unreasonable delay is brought in the course of a retrial. Two questions arise: (1) After a new trial is ordered, can an accused file a s. 11(b) motion for a stay of proceedings based on delay in the accused’s first trial? (2) Do the presumptive ceilings established in Jordan apply to retrial delay?

[3]                              The first question requires this Court to determine when an accused must indicate that their right to be tried within a reasonable time has not been respected. Given that the Jordan framework offers greater predictability and clarity and encourages all parties to act proactively, it follows, in my view, that an accused must raise the unreasonableness of trial delay in a timely manner. As a general rule, in the context of a single trial, an accused who believes that their right to be tried within a reasonable time has been infringed must act diligently and apply for a remedy before their trial is held. However, an accused may in some circumstances be justified in bringing such an application later, as is the case exceptionally on appeal. That being said, when an accused brings an application after an appeal court has ordered a new trial, the accused will no longer be able to raise the delay from their first trial. Only the retrial delay will be counted in calculating delay based on the presumptive ceilings applicable under the Jordan framework.

[4]                              The ceilings set in Jordan apply to retrial delay. The framework established in that case protects the right of an accused to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s. 11(b), and that provision equally guarantees this right to an accused who is tried a second time. Although it is generally accepted that retrials must be prioritized when scheduling hearings and that they will be shorter than first trials, I do not think it is appropriate to adopt different presumptive ceilings for retrials. The Jordan framework is flexible enough to be adapted to the specific circumstances of an accused who is retried.

I.               Background

[5]                              In February 2011, J.F. was charged by indictment with seven counts involving sexual offences against his daughter. The charges covered a period from 1986 to 2001.

[6]                              The preliminary inquiry was completed on March 28, 2012. The trial, whose estimated length was two days, began on December 3, 2013 in the Court of Québec, district of Montréal.

[7]                              On December 4, 2013, the prosecution announced a voir dire on the admissibility into evidence of the complainant’s video statement. The trial was then adjourned, and it resumed on October 20, 2014. On October 24, 2014, the voir dire ended and the trial judge reserved decision on it. Just over six months later, on May 8, 2015, the judge rendered his decision and found that the complainant’s statement was inadmissible.

[8]                              The trial resumed on January 18, 2016 and ended the same day. Argument was postponed and was then completed on May 16, 2016, at which time judgment was reserved. While judgment was reserved, this Court rendered its decision in Jordan. On February 10, 2017, six years after he was charged, J.F. was acquitted on all seven counts.

[9]                              The Crown appealed the decision and, on June 13, 2018, the Quebec Court of Appeal set aside the acquittal on the ground that the trial judge had analyzed the complainant’s credibility by relying erroneously on stereotypes and prejudices (2018 QCCA 986). It therefore ordered a new trial.

[10]                          On October 15, 2018, the parties agreed on dates for the retrial, which was to last 10 days. The retrial was then scheduled for April 29 to May 31, 2019.

[11]                          On December 28, 2018, J.F. filed a motion for a stay of proceedings for unreasonable delay under s. 11(b) of the Charter. That was the first time he alleged an infringement of his right to be tried within a reasonable time. In January 2019, the trial dates were moved up to March 11 to April 18, 2019. The motion for a stay of proceedings was argued on February 5, 2019.

II.            Decisions Below

A.           Court of Québec, 2019 QCCQ 1236 (Judge Roy)

[12]                          After making a global assessment of the delay for the first trial and the retrial, the trial judge held that the respondent’s right to be tried within a reasonable time had been infringed.

[13]                          She rejected the Crown’s argument that the accused’s long silence regarding the delay amounted to a waiver of his right to be tried within a reasonable time, because such a waiver must be clear, unequivocal and informed. Noting that there was uncontested evidence showing that the accused was concerned about the delay, the judge found that he had never waived his right to be tried within a reasonable time.

[14]                          The judge then calculated the delay. She found a gross delay of 72 months and 3 days between the charges and the verdict at the first trial, and she determined that, of that total, 70 months and 25 days were not attributable to the defence.

[15]                          In the Court of Québec, the Crown did not challenge the calculation or categorization of the first‑trial delay. Nor did it argue that there were exceptional circumstances or that the transitional circumstance provided for in Jordan applied. In its opinion, only the retrial delay had to be considered, that is, 10 months and 5 days. The judge rejected that argument. Taking a [translation] “global and contextual” approach to delay, she found that the first‑trial delay could not be disregarded in this case given that it “is clearly unreasonable” (paras. 73 and 75 (CanLII)). Not to consider it would be to deny the accused’s rights and would be contrary to the shift in culture sought by this Court. The judge held that the entire delay, including the first‑trial delay, had to be counted. She granted the motion based on unreasonable delay and entered a stay of proceedings.

B.            Quebec Court of Appeal, 2020 QCCA 666 (Levesque, Hogue and Sansfaçon JJ.A.)

[16]                          The Crown appealed the trial judge’s decision and argued that, under the Jordan framework, first‑trial delay cannot be included once an appeal court has ordered a new trial. For the reasons given by Levesque J.A., the Quebec Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and upheld the stay of proceedings, though it adopted a different approach than the trial judge.

[17]                          The Court of Appeal stated that the calculation of delay must restart at zero in cases where a new trial is ordered by an appeal court and that therefore the delay in the first trial cannot be added to the delay in the second. However, it refused to accept the Crown’s argument that the fact that a new trial has been ordered prevents an accused from raising a violation of s. 11(b) based on delay in their first trial. In the Court of Appeal’s view, [translation] “it would undoubtedly be unfair for an accused to be barred from presenting an initial motion on the sole ground that a violation was not raised in a timely manner” (para. 60 (CanLII)). The Court of Appeal also rejected the Crown’s argument that J.F.’s very long silence could be considered to be a waiver of the delay preceding the order for a new trial, given that the late presentation of a motion cannot in itself amount to a clear and unequivocal waiver. In this regard, the Court of Appeal further noted that although this Court explained in R. v. Morin, 1992 CanLII 89 (SCC), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 771, that inaction by an accused could lead to an inference that the accused suffered no actual prejudice, this reasoning no longer applies under Jordan because prejudice is no longer a factor in calculating delay.

[18]                          The Court of Appeal added that there cannot be an unqualified refusal to consider first‑trial delay. The fact that delay was not raised during the first trial does not mean that it is reasonable. While it is preferable for an accused to raise the unreasonableness of delay as soon as possible, an acquittal may be more advantageous than a stay of proceedings. In this regard, however, Levesque J.A. cautioned that his remarks should not be taken to mean that [translation] “the late presentation of motions under s. 11(b) should be encouraged” (para. 76).

[19]                          The Court of Appeal proposed a two‑step approach for calculating delay in a context where a new trial is ordered. Because the delays in the two trials must be considered separately, the first step is to assess the first‑trial delay under the Jordan framework. Only where that delay is reasonable does it become necessary to proceed to the second step and assess the retrial delay, starting from the order for a new trial. However, the Court of Appeal did not discuss the framework that applies in analyzing retrial delay.

[20]                          Applying the two‑step approach it had adopted to this case, the Court of Appeal began by noting that the total delay between the charges and the end of the argument at the first trial was 63 months and 8 days,[1] from which it subtracted 1 day attributable to the defence. Finding that this total delay exceeded the 30‑month presumptive ceiling established by this Court in Jordan, the Court of Appeal stated that it was up to the Crown to show that the delay was reasonable because of an exceptional circumstance or transitional considerations. Since the Crown had not pleaded any such circumstance, the Court of Appeal held that it had not rebutted the presumption that the delay was unreasonable. The Court of Appeal therefore dismissed the appeal and upheld the stay of proceedings.

III.         Issues

[21]                          The appeal raises the following questions:

(1)            After a new trial is ordered, can an accused file a s. 11(b) motion for a stay of proceedings based on delay in the accused’s first trial?

(2)            Do the presumptive ceilings established in Jordan apply to retrial delay?

IV.         Analysis

A.           Section 11(b) of the Charter and the Temporal Scope of the Right to Be Tried Within a Reasonable Time

(1)         Protection Conferred by Having the Status of a Person Charged With an Offence

[22]                          Timely justice is one of the characteristics of a free and democratic society, and the conduct of trials within a reasonable time is of central importance in the administration of Canada’s criminal justice system (Jordan, at paras. 1 and 19). Section 11(b) of the Charter reflects the importance of this principle by guaranteeing any person charged with an offence the right “to be tried within a reasonable time”. The purpose of this provision is to protect both the rights of accused persons and the interests of society as a whole (R. v. K.J.M., 2019 SCC 55, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 39, at para. 38). At the individual level, trials within a reasonable time are essential to protect the liberty, security and fair trial interests of any person charged with an offence, who, it should be remembered, is presumed to be innocent (Jordan, at para. 20; see also R. v. Godin, 2009 SCC 26, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 30, citing Morin, at pp. 801‑3). At the collective or societal level, timely trials encourage better participation by victims and witnesses, minimize the “worry and frustration [they experience] until they have given their testimony” and allow them to move on with their lives more quickly (Jordan, at para. 24, quoting R. v. Askov, 1990 CanLII 45 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1199, at p. 1220; see also Jordan, at para. 23). Timely trials also help to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice (Jordan, at para. 25; Askov, at pp. 1220‑21).

[23]                          Section 11(b) protects an accused only while they have the status of a person charged with an offence (R. v. Potvin, 1993 CanLII 113 (SCC), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 880, at p. 908). The term “person charged with an offence” has been interpreted broadly by this Court and refers to a person who is the subject of criminal proceedings (R. v. MacDougall, 1998 CanLII 763 (SCC), [1998] 3 S.C.R. 45, at paras. 11‑13). A person is charged with an offence from the time the charge is laid (R. v. Kalanj, 1989 CanLII 63 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1594, at p. 1602; Potvin, at p. 910) until the final resolution of the matter and the end of the sentencing process (MacDougall, at paras. 10 and 17‑18; R. v. K.G.K., 2020 SCC 7, at paras. 26‑27). On appeal, an accused is no longer a person charged with an offence (Potvin, at pp. 911‑12; MacDougall, at para. 17). The accused reverts to this status only if the trial decision is set aside and a new trial is ordered (Potvin, at p. 912).

[24]                          While s. 11(b) protects an accused throughout the period when they have the status of a person charged with an offence, the framework established in Jordan has a limited temporal scope. The presumptive ceilings apply only to delay in holding the trial.

(2)         Temporal Scope of the Jordan Ceilings

[25]                          Prior to Jordan, s. 11(b) applications were decided under the framework established in Morin. That framework involved a test with four factors that were to be balanced to determine whether trial delay was unreasonable: “. . . (1) the length of the delay; (2) defence waiver; (3) the reasons for the delay, including the inherent needs of the case, defence delay, Crown delay, institutional delay, and other reasons for delay; and (4) prejudice to the accused’s interests in liberty, security of the person, and a fair trial” (Jordan, at para. 30; Godin, at para. 18; Morin, at pp. 787‑88).

[26]                          In an effort to end the culture of complacency that had developed in the criminal justice system, which tolerated excessive delay in bringing accused persons to trial, this Court established a new framework in Jordan for the application of s. 11(b). The Court set two ceilings beyond which delay is presumptively unreasonable: (1) a ceiling of 18 months for simple cases going to trial in the provincial court, and (2) a ceiling of 30 months for cases going to trial in the superior court or in the provincial court after a preliminary inquiry (para. 46). Delay attributable to the defence is subtracted from the total delay (paras. 47 and 60). If the net total delay exceeds the applicable ceiling, it is presumptively unreasonable. The Crown can then attempt to show that the delay is reasonable by raising exceptional circumstances (para. 47). If the net total delay is below the ceiling, the defence can try to establish that the delay is unreasonable by showing that “(1) it took meaningful steps that demonstrate a sustained effort to expedite the proceedings, and (2) the case took markedly longer than it reasonably should have” (para. 48 (emphasis in original)).

[27]                          The presumptive ceilings set in Jordan do not apply to the entire period when an accused is a person charged with an offence. The framework established in that case is limited in scope, since it provides a solution to a specific problem. Jordan deals with the culture of complacency that allows for excessive delay in bringing an accused to trial (K.G.K., at para. 34, citing Jordan, at paras. 2, 4, 13, 117, 121 and 129). The new framework applies to the delay from the charge to the actual or anticipated end of trial, that is, “when the parties’ involvement in the merits of the trial is complete, and the case is turned over to the trier of fact” (K.G.K., at para. 31; see also para. 33; Jordan, at para. 47; R. v. Rice, 2018 QCCA 198, at para. 41 (CanLII)). Deliberation time is excluded from this framework (K.G.K., at para. 50). Sentencing proceedings are also excluded from the framework. Although the Court recognized in Jordan that s. 11(b) continues to apply between conviction and sentencing, it made no comment on how such delay should be treated (para. 49, fn. 2).

[28]                          Jordan also does not address the question of when an accused must bring a motion for a stay of proceedings. In this regard, it should be noted that the Court declined to decide how the presumptive ceilings should be applied where, for example, a s. 11(b) application is brought following a conviction (para. 49, fn. 2). Nor does Jordan set out the framework that applies in cases where a new trial is ordered.

[29]                          To determine whether first‑trial delay may be raised under the Jordan framework after a new trial has been ordered, it is necessary to consider, first, the duty of an accused to act proactively with respect to delay and, second, the timing of an application based on unreasonable delay and the possibility of obtaining a remedy for the delay complained of.

B.            After a New Trial Is Ordered, Can an Accused File a Section 11(b) Motion for a Stay of Proceedings Based on Delay in the Accused’s First Trial?

(1)         Jordan and the Duty of an Accused to Raise an Infringement of Their Right to Be Tried Within a Reasonable Time in a Timely Manner

[30]                          While Jordan does not indicate the point in time when an accused must bring a s. 11(b) motion, the Court has nonetheless been clear about how it wishes all participants in the criminal justice system to act: at all stages of the trial process, everyone must take proactive measures to remedy any delay and to ensure that the accused is tried in a timely manner (Jordan, at paras. 137‑39; R. v. Thanabalasingham, 2020 SCC 18, at para. 9).

[31]                          The new framework marks a shift away from a retrospective approach and adopts a prospective standpoint that allows the various participants to know the bounds of reasonableness from the outset of the proceedings (Jordan, at para. 108; K.G.K., at para. 43). The predictability of the new framework makes the parties more accountable and encourages them to be proactive about delay (Jordan, at para. 112; R. v. Cody, 2017 SCC 31, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 659, at para. 36). In the case of the Crown, the prospective approach clarifies the content of its constitutional obligation to bring the accused to trial within a reasonable time (Jordan, at para. 112). As for the accused, the predictability provided by the new framework requires that they be an active part of the solution to the problem of delay in criminal cases (Jordan, at paras. 84‑86 and 113).

[32]                          As this Court wrote in Morin, “[t]he purpose of s. 11(b) is to expedite trials and minimize prejudice and not to avoid trials on the merits” (p. 802). This section was not intended to make it possible for an accused to frustrate the ends of justice (Jordan, at paras. 21, 60 and 63). As the Court also recently noted, an accused may not benefit from the lengthening of delay where it is caused by the accused’s own conduct (R. v. Boulanger, 2022 SCC 2, at para. 6; R. v. Ste‑Marie, 2022 SCC 3, at para. 11).

[33]                          Defence conduct is considered under the Jordan framework, since the delay attributable to the defence is subtracted from the gross total delay (para. 60). Defence delay has two components: (1) delay waived by the defence, and (2) delay caused solely or directly by the defence (Jordan, at paras. 61 and 63; Cody, at para. 26). Inaction may amount to illegitimate conduct on the part of the defence, because “[i]llegitimacy may extend to omissions as well as acts” (Cody, at para. 33). As this Court said in Cody, the defence may not benefit from its own inaction or lateness in taking action; it must act proactively:

      Accused persons must bear in mind that a corollary of the s. 11(b) right “to be tried within a reasonable time” is the responsibility to avoid causing unreasonable delay. Defence counsel are therefore expected to “actively advanc[e] their clients’ right to a trial within a reasonable time, collaborat[e] with Crown counsel when appropriate and . . . us[e] court time efficiently” (Jordan, at para. 138). [para. 33]

[34]                          An accused who sees delay lengthening must therefore respond in a proactive manner. Being proactive may mean filing a s. 11(b) motion where the accused believes that their right to be tried within a reasonable time is not being or will not be respected (Jordan, at para. 85). Like any other application made by an accused, a motion of this kind must be brought “reasonably and expeditiously” (para. 85). Lateness in raising delay is contrary to the proper administration of justice, because such a practice serves to waste judicial resources. Indeed, the Jordan framework is specifically designed to eliminate inefficient practices that impact on the justice system (paras. 41 and 116). Bringing a s. 11(b) motion before the end of the trial allows the accused to alert the Crown and the court to their concerns about delay. As a result, all parties can take proactive measures and cooperate to expedite the proceedings.

[35]                          It is generally recognized that an accused who raises the unreasonableness of delay after trial (R. v. Rabba (1991), 1991 CanLII 7073 (ON CA), 64 C.C.C. (3d) 445 (Ont. C.A.)), and particularly after conviction (R. v. Warring, 2017 ABCA 128, 347 C.C.C. (3d) 391, at para. 11; R. v. C.D., 2014 ABCA 392, 588 A.R. 82), is not acting in a timely manner. In K.G.K., Moldaver J. interpreted the prospective approach adopted in Jordan as “encourag[ing] pre‑trial s. 11(b) applications” (para. 43 (emphasis added)). The defence is in fact encouraged to act before the start of the trial, since the Jordan framework allows “the parties to know ‘in advance, the bounds of reasonableness so proactive measures can be taken to remedy any delay’” (K.G.K., at para. 43, quoting Jordan, at para. 108 (emphasis in original)).

[36]                          In short, a duty to act proactively also rests on the accused. As a result, the accused must indicate that their right to be tried within a reasonable time has not been respected and, where the circumstances require, bring a motion for a stay of proceedings in a timely manner. As a general rule, this means before the trial is held. By the time the trial dates are set, the parties are generally in a position to know whether the trial delay will exceed the applicable presumptive ceiling, and the defence can raise any concerns it may have. However, it is not out of the question that, exceptionally, an infringement of the s. 11(b) right will reveal itself only once the trial has begun. In such a case, the accused must also act proactively.

(2)         A Section 11(b) Application Can Be Brought on Appeal Only Exceptionally

[37]                          If a s. 11(b) motion is considered late when filed after the end of a trial, only exceptionally will an accused be able to raise this issue for the first time on appeal.

[38]                          Raising new arguments on appeal is generally discouraged in criminal matters, because the best interests of justice require finality in the adjudication of such matters at trial, as L’Heureux‑Dubé J., dissenting, but not on this point, explained in R. v. Brown, 1993 CanLII 114 (SCC), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 918:

      Both the Crown and the defence would face uncertainty, as counsel for both sides, having discovered that the strategy adopted at trial did not result in the desired or expected verdict, devised new approaches. Costs would escalate and the resolution of criminal matters could be spread out over years in the most routine cases. Moreover, society’s expectation that criminal matters will be disposed of fairly and fully at the first instance and its respect for the administration of justice would be undermined. Juries would rightfully be uncertain if they were fulfilling an important societal function or merely wasting their time. For these reasons, courts have always adhered closely to the rule that such tactics will not be permitted. [pp. 923‑24]

[39]                          A motion for a stay of proceedings brought for the first time on appeal, without the trial judge having had an opportunity to consider its merits, should normally be dismissed (Rabba; R. v. G. (L.), 2007 ONCA 654, 228 C.C.C. (3d) 194, at paras. 42‑43; Phillips v. R., 2017 QCCA 1284, at paras. 29‑31 (CanLII)). The trial court is best placed to rule on such a motion, because it is the one that has a complete picture of the proceedings. Indeed, this Court noted in Jordan that trial judges are uniquely positioned to categorize various periods of delay (paras. 71 and 79).

[40]                          Generally speaking, appeal courts are reluctant to entertain new arguments, because they are deprived of the trial court’s perspective (R. v. Roach, 2009 ONCA 156, 246 O.A.C. 96, at para. 6; Ontario (Labour) v. Cobra Float Service Inc., 2020 ONCA 527, 65 C.C.E.L. (4th) 169, at para. 19). This is also the case for constitutional issues (Roach, at para. 6; R. v. Chambers, 2013 ONCA 680, 311 O.A.C. 307, at para. 45). Only in exceptional circumstances will a party be permitted to raise a new argument on appeal (Guindon v. Canada, 2015 SCC 41, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 20‑23; Phillips, at para. 14).

[41]                          Where an argument is raised for the first time on appeal, the appeal court must determine whether the situation is an exceptional one in which the exercise of its discretion is warranted, having regard to all of the circumstances. For this purpose, the court must consider, among other things, “the state of the record, fairness to all parties, the importance of having the issue resolved by this [c]ourt, its suitability for decision and the broader interests of the administration of justice” (Guindon, at para. 20). What is meant by “state of the record” is that there must be sufficient evidence in the record for the court to decide the issue (see Phillips, at para. 19; R. v. Kitaitchik (2002), 2002 CanLII 45000 (ON CA), 166 C.C.C. (3d) 14 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 36). In every case, an appeal court’s “discretion to hear and decide new issues should only be exercised exceptionally and never unless the challenger shows that doing so causes no prejudice to the parties” (Guindon, at para. 23; Performance Industries Ltd. v. Sylvan Lake Golf & Tennis Club Ltd., 2002 SCC 19, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 678, at para. 33; Phillips, at para. 14; Ontario (Labour), at para. 20; G. (L.), at para. 43).

[42]                          It is therefore only exceptionally that an infringement of the right to be tried within a reasonable time can be raised by an accused for the first time on appeal. The outcome of an unreasonable delay application brought following an order for a new trial must now be considered.

(3)         An Accused’s Silence or Inaction Does Not in Itself Amount to a Waiver of Delay

[43]                          The Crown argues that where an accused raises first‑trial delay in the course of a retrial, the accused’s failure to allege an infringement of their right to be tried within a reasonable time during their first trial or on appeal can be raised against them. In support of this argument, the Crown suggests that a court can regard an accused’s long silence or lengthy inaction as [translation] “amount[ing] to a clear and unequivocal waiver or an acceptance of the delay associated with a past trial” (A.F., at para. 24; see also para. 42).

[44]                          I must reject that proposition. Although the time at which an accused raises the unreasonableness of trial delay may affect the outcome of their motion, waiver of the delay cannot be inferred solely from the accused’s silence or failure to act. This is what the Court’s jurisprudence teaches, and, in my view, it would be inappropriate to depart from it. In addition to being wrong in law, this proposition by the Crown is a needless one, because this Court has clearly established how an accused’s inaction or lateness in taking action must be assessed.

[45]                          This Court has repeatedly stated that the requirements for finding a waiver of a constitutional right must be strictly construed but that this does not preclude an accused from waiving a procedural right (R. v. Hebert, 1990 CanLII 118 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151, at p. 203; Korponay v. Attorney General of Canada, 1982 CanLII 12 (SCC), [1982] 1 S.C.R. 41, at pp. 48‑49). An accused may waive a procedural rule as long as this is done “with full knowledge of the rights the procedure was enacted to protect and the effect that waiver will have on those rights” (R. v. Tran, 1994 CanLII 56 (SCC), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 951, at p. 997).

[46]                          Section 11(b) of the Charter states that any person charged with an offence has the right to be tried within a reasonable time. Such a person may waive a given delay, which will then be subtracted from the total delay (Jordan, at para. 61). It is important to note that, where “waiver” concerns the right set out in s. 11(b) of the Charter, “it is not the right itself which is being waived but merely the inclusion of specific periods in the overall assessment of reasonableness” (R. v. Conway, 1989 CanLII 66 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1659, at p. 1686, quoted in Jordan, at para. 61).

[47]                          Waiver “can be explicit or implicit, but in either case, it must be clear and unequivocal” (Jordan, at para. 61; see also Morin, at p. 790; Askov, at p. 1228). In this sense, as the Court stated in Askov, an accused’s mere silence or inaction cannot indicate a waiver of delay:

      The failure of an accused to assert the right does not give the Crown licence to proceed with an unfair trial. Failure to assert the right would be insufficient in itself to impugn the motives of the accused as might be the case with regard to other s. 11 rights. Rather there must be something in the conduct of the accused that is sufficient to give rise to an inference that the accused has understood that he or she had a s. 11(b) guarantee, understood its nature and has waived the right provided by that guarantee. Although no particular magical incantation of words is required to waive a right, nevertheless the waiver must be expressed in some manner. Silence or lack of objection cannot constitute a lawful waiver. [Emphasis added; pp. 1228‑29.]

      (See also Mills v. The Queen, 1986 CanLII 17 (SCC), [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863, at p. 929.)

[48]                          Waiver must be proved by the prosecution (Askov, at p. 1229). For a court to find that delay has been waived, the accused must therefore take “some direct action from which a consent to delay can be properly inferred” (Askov, at p. 1229). The “mere silence of the accused is not sufficient to indicate a waiver of a Charter right” (Askov, at p. 1229; see also Mills, at p. 929). To be inferable, implicit waiver “requires advertence to the act of release rather than mere inadvertence. If the mind of the accused or his or her counsel is not turned to the issue of waiver and is not aware of what his or her conduct signifies, then this conduct does not constitute waiver” (Morin, at p. 790).

[49]                          Lateness in bringing a s. 11(b) motion for a stay of proceedings nonetheless remains an important factor in determining whether an accused has waived delay. In Rabba, Arbour J.A., as she then was, noted that the fact that such a motion is brought after trial “would, in most cases, be fatal” and “would normally amount to a waiver of any claim which may arise under s. 11(b) of the Charter” (p. 447). While lateness in bringing a motion for a stay of proceedings may be a relevant factor, it cannot in itself establish waiver. This is how Arbour J.A.’s comments in Rabba must be interpreted. Waiver is established on the basis of an accused’s conduct (Askov, at p. 1228), having regard to the circumstances of each case (see, e.g., Warring, at paras. 11‑13 and 27).

[50]                          I note as well that the Crown’s general proposition is not easily incorporated into the new framework established by Jordan, under which prejudice to the accused is no longer considered as an analytical factor, as it was under the Morin framework. The Crown’s proposition is at odds with the new framework, in that it resurrects the uncertainty and complexity of the prejudice inquiry. Under the Morin framework, it could be inferred that long delays had prejudiced an accused even where there was no direct evidence of prejudice (p. 801; Godin, at para. 31). Conversely, the Crown could raise the accused’s inaction to show that such conduct was inconsistent with a desire for a timely trial (Morin, at pp. 790 and 802‑3). However, establishing prejudice was a complicated and uncertain process, as the absence of a consistent standard made the application of the former framework “highly unpredictable” and the treatment of prejudice “highly subjective” (Jordan, at paras. 32‑33). The Jordan framework eliminates the uncertainty of the previous framework, because prejudice is taken into consideration in a different way: once the presumptive ceiling is breached, the accused is now presumed to have suffered prejudice to their liberty, security of the person, and fair trial interests (para. 54). Adopting the Crown’s proposition would therefore, to some degree, have the effect of indirectly resurrecting the possibility of raising an accused’s inaction or lateness in taking action in order to disprove the existence of prejudice.

[51]                          This proposition by the Crown also makes the application of the current framework more complex. Indeed, it involves a multi‑factored test for inferring waiver from an accused’s inaction. The factors that the Crown suggests considering include the duration of the inaction, the accused’s conduct and situation, the prosecution’s conduct and the manner in which the earlier proceeding unfolded (A.F., at paras. 25 and 77 et seq.). However, Jordan already specifies how an accused’s inaction or silence is to be treated. Delay may be attributed to the defence where it is waived by the accused or where it is caused solely by the accused’s conduct, which includes inaction (Jordan, at paras. 61‑63; Cody, at para. 33).

[52]                          In short, therefore, the Crown’s proposition cannot be adopted. An accused’s silence or inaction cannot in itself give rise to an inference that the accused has waived delay, although it may be a relevant and important factor in the waiver inquiry. This conclusion is an obvious one given the fact that any person charged with an offence has the right to be tried within a reasonable time without having to explicitly state their wish to be protected by this right (Rabba; see also Morin, at p. 802). An accused nonetheless has a duty to raise an infringement of their right to be tried within a reasonable time in a timely manner. At the risk of repeating myself, an accused may not benefit from their own inaction or lateness in taking action. The new framework sanctions an accused’s inaction or lateness in taking action. Inaction may be considered illegitimate conduct, and the delay associated with it may be attributed to the defence when the unreasonableness of delay is being determined (Jordan, at paras. 63, 113 and 121; Cody, at para. 33).

(4)         An Accused May Not Raise First‑Trial Delay Once a New Trial Is Ordered

[53]                          In Jordan, the Court established that delay runs from the charge to the actual or anticipated end of trial (para. 47), but it did not specify how an order for a new trial affects the calculation of delay. However, Potvin provides useful guidance in this regard. First, Sopinka J. stated in that case that such an order revives the accused’s status as a person charged with an offence (p. 912). Second, he added, citing D. H. Doherty, that the “constitutional clock” for calculating delay begins running at the time the appellate court orders a new trial:

     This does not mean that when there is an adjudication relating to a charge which is appealed, s. 11(b) is spent. If on the appeal the judgment is set aside and the matter is remitted for trial, the accused reverts to the status of a person charged. As stated by D. H. Doherty (now a justice of the Court of Appeal for Ontario) in “More Flesh on the Bones: The Continued Judicial Interpretation of s. 11(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms” (1984), Canadian Bar Association — Ontario; Annual Institute on Continuing Legal Education, at p. 9:

     Section 11(b) does not appear to operate at the appellate stage. Section 11(b) guarantees a trial within a reasonable time, not a final determination of the matter at an appellate level within that time. If, however, a new trial is ordered on appeal, or some other order is made directing the continuation of the trial proceedings, the constitutional clock should be rewound at the time of the order by the appellate court. [Bold and underlining added; pp. 912‑13.]

[54]                          Prior to Jordan, appellate jurisprudence seemed to allow an accused who was sent back to be tried again to raise the delay in both their first trial and their retrial (see R. v. Boisvert, 2014 QCCA 191, at para. 54 (CanLII); R. v. Barros, 2014 ABCA 367, 317 C.C.C. (3d) 67, at paras. 51‑53; R. v. Nikkel, 2009 MBCA 8, 240 Man. R. (2d) 1; R. v. Fitts, 2015 ONCJ 746, at para. 5 (CanLII)). In the view of M. Vauclair and T. Desjardins, that approach was implicitly endorsed by this Court in R. v. Collins, 1995 CanLII 114 (SCC), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1104 (Traité général de preuve et de procédure pénales (28th ed. 2021), at No. 28.30). In that case, the accused persons had applied for a stay of proceedings at their retrial, and the stay had been ordered by the trial judge but set aside by the Court of Appeal. This Court restored the stay of proceedings on the ground that the delay was unreasonable under Morin. However, it did not discuss the right of an accused to bring such an application in a retrial.

[55]                          The situation is completely different now, because the Court has made stays of proceedings subject to new parameters, as set out in Jordan. It should now be understood that the computation of delay restarts at zero when a new trial is ordered. This is also the interpretation adopted by the Ontario Court of Appeal and the Alberta Court of Appeal (R. v. MacIsaac, 2018 ONCA 650, 141 O.R. (3d) 721, at para. 31; R. v. JEV, 2019 ABCA 359, 381 C.C.C. (3d) 392, at paras. 36‑37; R. v. J.A.L., 2019 ABCA 415, at para. 6 (CanLII)). What was said in Potvin cannot be interpreted in any other way today. Since the adoption of the Jordan framework, which requires an accused to take appropriate action in a timely manner, an accused cannot bring a s. 11(b) motion during a retrial based on delay in their first trial.

[56]                          Lateness in taking action impedes the proper administration of justice and contributes to maintaining inefficient practices that have a negative impact on the justice system and its limited resources (Jordan, at paras. 41 and 116). Because the prospective approach adopted in Jordan allows the parties to know from the outset what time is reasonable for their proceedings, they have a responsibility to take proactive measures to prevent that time from being exceeded. This responsibility lies upon both the Crown and the defence. An accused who sees delay lengthening must act reasonably and expeditiously (Jordan, at para. 85). Bringing a motion in a retrial for a stay of proceedings based on first‑trial delay is contrary to this duty and interferes with the proper administration of justice. It disregards the very reason for which a new trial was ordered, as it essentially results in a stillborn trial. Moreover, given that such a motion is generally recognized as being late if it is brought after a trial has begun, it would be illogical to permit an accused to bring it even later, in the course of a retrial.

[57]                          In the instant case, even though the Quebec Court of Appeal recognized that the delay clock is reset to zero after a new trial is ordered, it found that this principle does not prevent an accused from raising first‑trial delay after such an order is made (para. 59). In support of this position, Levesque J.A. made two main points. First, relying on the principle that silence does not amount to a waiver, he suggested that a motion cannot be dismissed solely for being late (paras. 60‑61, 64 and 70). Second, he stated that Jordan does not seem to prohibit such a motion from being brought in the course of a retrial, since the new framework no longer allows the Crown to raise lateness in taking action against the accused (para. 69).

[58]                          That approach should not be adopted. The Court of Appeal failed to consider the fact that an accused also has a duty to act proactively. On the first point made by the Court of Appeal, I must acknowledge that the court was correct in stating that an accused’s long silence cannot in itself give rise to an inference that delay has been waived. With respect, however, I am of the view that the Court of Appeal erred in accepting that this may justify bringing a s. 11(b) motion after a new trial has been ordered. While an accused has no legal obligation to assert their right to be tried within a reasonable time in order for that right to exist (Morin, at p. 802, cited by the Court of Appeal, at para. 60), this does not entitle the accused to do nothing when they believe that their s. 11(b) right is not being or will not be respected. The Court’s teachings are clear on this point: s. 11(b) does not allow an accused to benefit unduly from the lengthening of delay, notwithstanding the fact that it is the Crown that has a constitutional obligation to bring the accused to trial.

[59]                          With regard to the second justification it put forward, the Court of Appeal also failed to consider the responsibility that rests on accused persons when it comes to delay. It is true that prejudice is no longer a factor to be taken into account under the new framework and that the Crown can no longer attempt to justify a delay that is now presumptively unreasonable by inferring from an accused’s lateness in bringing a motion that the accused is satisfied with the situation (Jordan, at paras. 54 and 81). However, the fact that the Crown can no longer raise the lateness of a motion against an accused does not authorize a lack of diligence by the accused in this regard. Jordan is clear on this point.

[60]                          When a new trial is ordered, the constitutional clock for calculating delay is reset to zero (Gakmakge v. R., 2017 QCCS 3279; JEV, at para. 37; Masson v. R., 2019 QCCS 2953, 57 C.R. (7th) 415, at para. 91). It follows that only the retrial delay can be counted when a s. 11(b) application is brought in that new trial. This is not to say, however, that a court may not consider first‑trial delay in assessing the reasonableness of retrial delay in certain exceptional circumstances.

C.            Do the Presumptive Ceilings Established in Jordan Apply to Retrial Delay?

(1)         The Presumptive Ceilings Established in Jordan Apply to the Delay in a New Trial

[61]                          In Jordan, the Court did not discuss how the framework it created would apply in a context where a new trial was ordered. However, this does not mean that the presumptive ceilings it established do not apply to new trials. Jordan has a limited temporal scope and does not encompass all types of delay (para. 49; K.G.K., at para. 39); the presumptive ceilings set by the Court relate specifically to trial delay. Jordan’s particular focus was on addressing the culture of complacency toward courtroom delay (para. 45). The presumptive ceilings are intended to facilitate this culture shift by encouraging parties to act proactively in order to expedite proceedings (para. 112). After a new trial is ordered, the accused regains the status of a person charged with an offence and the Crown once again has a duty to bring the accused to trial within a reasonable time. Delay following such an order is trial delay and therefore falls within Jordan. Although I do not consider it appropriate to set new ceilings for retrials, as I will explain below, I nevertheless cannot adopt the approach of the Alberta Court of Appeal, which declined to apply any ceiling in this context (JEV, at paras. 40, 42 and 50). Not applying the Jordan ceilings to retrials would be contrary to the principles established in that case.

(2)         The Presumptive Ceilings Should Not Be Changed

[62]                          The respondent and certain interveners propose the adoption of lower presumptive ceilings for retrials. This proposal cannot be accepted.

[63]                          This Court recently had to consider a similar proposal in K.J.M. In that case, the appellant asked the Court to establish a 12‑month presumptive ceiling for single‑stage proceedings in youth justice courts under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1. However, the Court declined to set a lower ceiling for youth cases. Moldaver J., writing for the majority, noted in particular that the appellant had failed to show that the criminal justice system specifically for young persons had a problem with delay that warranted “the imposition of a new constitutional standard” (para. 63).

[64]                          It must be remembered that the presumptive ceilings adopted in Jordan address a particular problem, that is, the culture of complacency toward trial delay. The retrospective approach that characterized the Morin framework, together with the difficulties that arose in applying that framework, played a part in exacerbating that situation. The problem was a real one, which the presumptive ceilings established by this Court in Jordan were specifically intended to remedy.

[65]                          In this case, the respondent has not shown that there is a real problem, let alone one that could warrant the imposition of a new constitutional standard. To support their proposal, the respondent and the Association des avocats de la défense de Montréal‑Laval‑Longueuil refer mainly to the suggestion made by A. D. Gold, M. Lacy and L. Metcalfe that a six‑month ceiling for trials in provincial courts and an eight‑month ceiling for trials in superior courts would be appropriate (A Practical Guide to the Charter: Section 11(b) (2019), at pp. 15‑16).

[66]                          I must point out that the presumptive ceilings established in Jordan provide a uniform general framework for assessing the reasonableness of the delay between the charge and the end of trial, “irrespective of the varying degrees of prejudice experienced by different groups and individuals” (K.J.M., at para. 65). Like Moldaver J., I am of the view that setting ceilings applicable to new trials “would undermine this uniformity and lead to a multiplicity of ceilings, each varying with the unique level of prejudice experienced by the particular category or subcategory of persons in question” (para. 65). It follows that the creation of a new ceiling in this case would also be “incompatible with the uniform‑ceiling approach adopted in Jordan and would undermine its objective of simplifying and streamlining the s. 11(b) framework” (para. 65).

[67]                          I would also observe, as Moldaver J. noted in K.J.M., that Jordan establishes ceilings for reasonableness, not floors for unreasonableness, and that in most cases accused persons should be brought to trial within a time that is below the ceilings:

     While the presumptive ceilings are a significant chapter in Jordan, they are not the full story. Jordan established ceilings, not floors. While the ceilings offer a bright‑line approach, they are supplemented by a more flexible, case‑specific approach to delay below the ceiling. In this way, Jordan marries uniformity with flexibility.

     . . .

     In embracing this proactive approach, prosecutors should bear in mind that the presumptive ceiling “is not an aspirational target”, 18 or 30 months is still “a long time to wait for justice”, and most cases “can and should” be completed in less time (Jordan, at paras. 56‑57). [Underlining added; paras. 69 and 82.]

[68]                          The Jordan framework is therefore flexible enough to be used by courts to determine whether retrial delay is reasonable, even where it is below the presumptive ceiling. Delay is not reasonable simply because it is within the applicable ceiling; it is only presumptively reasonable. Delay may be found to be unreasonable “even if it falls below the presumptive ceiling” (Jordan, at para. 82).

(3)         Factors to Be Considered in Determining the Reasonableness of Retrial Delay Where It Is Below the Applicable Presumptive Ceiling

[69]                          The retrial context differs from that of a first trial, since normally the parties have already presented their evidence and arguments a first time. To take account of the specific nature of this context, I propose two factors that can be considered in analyzing the reasonableness of retrial delay. These factors must, of course, be applied flexibly, having regard to the circumstances of each case.

[70]                          The first factor is the need to prioritize retrials when scheduling hearings. The parties are agreed on this point. Appeal courts and trial courts have also recognized it on a number of occasions (JEV, at para. 38; MacIsaac, at paras. 23‑25; J.A.L., at para. 14; R. v. Richard, 2017 MBQB 11, 375 C.R.R. (2d) 61, at para. 32). Participants in the criminal justice system, particularly the Crown and the court, must act proactively when a new trial is ordered so that dates can quickly be set for that trial, which must normally be prioritized. As mentioned above, the accused also has a role to play in this regard and must take proactive measures for this purpose.

[71]                          The second factor goes hand in hand with the first: retrials are, as a general rule, to be conducted in less time than first trials. The parties are also agreed on this point. It is commonly recognized that retrials will have a shorter time frame than first trials because the parties’ respective evidence and positions have been presented a first time (JEV, at para. 38; MacIsaac, at para. 27; Masson, at para. 91). However, I note that it is not out of the question for a retrial comparable in length to the first trial to be justified in certain circumstances. For example, a change in strategy by the prosecution or the accused might mean that the work done during the first trial is no longer relevant (JEV, at para. 41; Masson, at para. 89). This is why the analysis of delay must remain contextual and take account of the specific circumstances of each case.

[72]                          These two factors are grounded in the duty of all participants in the criminal justice system to act in a timely manner. In the retrial context, this means that everyone, and especially the Crown, must ensure that retrials are prioritized when trial dates are set and that retrial delay is as short as possible. Recognition of these factors is based on the objectives of s. 11(b). First, prioritizing retrials and considering that, as a general rule, retrials should be conducted in less time protects the s. 11(b) rights of accused persons and limits the negative consequences of being charged with a criminal offence (Jordan, at para. 20; Morin, at pp. 801‑3). The making of an order for a new trial prolongs the period during which the accused is a person charged with an offence as well as the stress, anxiety and stigma associated with having that status. Indeed, this Court reiterated in Jordan that lengthy delay gives rise to an inference of prejudice to the accused (paras. 34, 54 and 110). Although Jordan eliminates the concept of prejudice as an analytical factor, this concept nonetheless remains central under the new framework, because the setting of presumptive ceilings was in fact based on the presumption that significant delay is prejudicial to an accused (para. 54). Second, the adoption of these two factors reflects recognition of the fact that prolonged delay also causes prejudice to victims, witnesses and the justice system as a whole (para. 110; see also paras. 22‑27).

[73]                          These factors must be assessed contextually, as required by Jordan. In this regard, first‑trial delay is one of the circumstances that may be taken into account in the assessment. In a context where the first‑trial delay exceeds the applicable ceiling, failure to act expeditiously and to prioritize the case could weigh in favour of a finding that the retrial delay is unreasonable. However, the analysis remains contextual and flexible, and it is for the court to make this determination in light of the specific circumstances of each case. The fact that this contextual element is considered does not allow an accused to raise first‑trial delay indirectly. It must be remembered that the constitutional clock for delay is reset to zero when a new trial is ordered and that, from that point on, first‑trial delay can no longer be counted. Giving too much weight to first‑trial delay would be contrary to the principles set out in Jordan, which creates, first and foremost, a prospective framework that encourages parties to act proactively. Where a s. 11(b) motion is brought in the course of a retrial, it is the delay in that trial that remains the focus of the analysis.

V.           Application to This Appeal

[74]                          In this case, the respondent did not act in a timely manner. Neither before nor during his first trial did he raise an infringement of his right to be tried within a reasonable time. Nor did he make an argument to this effect in the Court of Appeal after the Crown decided to appeal the verdict. It was not until a few months before his retrial was to be held that he brought his s. 11(b) motion.

[75]                          Although the retrial judge found that there was evidence to suggest that the accused had been concerned about delay during the first trial, the fact remains that he never applied for a remedy for that delay. The respondent was charged in February 2011, and his first trial ended in May 2016. He was acquitted in February 2017. The Crown appealed the trial judge’s decision. In the Court of Appeal, the respondent did not allege that there had been unreasonable delay in his trial. A new trial was ordered on June 13, 2018, and the respondent brought a s. 11(b) motion for a stay of proceedings for unreasonable delay for the first time on December 28, 2018. That motion concerned the delays in the first trial and the retrial.

[76]                          Given that the respondent brought his s. 11(b) application in the course of his retrial, the delay in his first trial cannot be considered in calculating the total delay. Only the delay since the order for a new trial is counted. The trial judge therefore erred in combining the delays for the two trials in assessing whether the s. 11(b) right had been infringed. Such an approach in fact leads to an absurd result, because adding the delays together makes ordering a new trial pointless. While the Court of Appeal correctly recognized that combining the delays for the two trials was inconsistent with the new framework established in Jordan, the two‑step approach it proposed is also wrong, because it allows an accused to raise first‑trial delay after a retrial has been ordered.

[77]                          To determine whether a motion for a stay of proceedings is well founded, a court must begin by calculating the total delay between the order for a new trial and the actual or anticipated end of that trial. Here, the order was made by the Court of Appeal on June 13, 2018. At the time the motion for a stay of proceedings was argued, the anticipated end of the trial was April 18, 2019, and the total delay was estimated at 10 months and 5 days. None of the delay was attributable to the defence. This delay is well below the 30‑month presumptive ceiling applicable to the first trial.[2]

[78]                          In this case, if the respondent were to be retried, none of the factors associated with this specific context supports a finding that his right to be tried within a reasonable time was infringed. There is no evidence establishing that the retrial was not prioritized. In October 2018, the parties scheduled that trial for the first available period, April 29 to May 31, 2019, resulting in a total delay of 11.5 months. In January 2019, after the respondent brought his s. 11(b) application, the trial dates were moved up to March 11 to April 18, 2019. The anticipated retrial delay then became 10 months and 5 days, which is reasonable and much shorter than the first‑trial delay, in addition to being below the 30‑month presumptive ceiling. It is true that the first trial seems to have taken markedly longer than it should have. In this case, however, the length of the first‑trial delay has relatively little, if any, weight. Given that the anticipated retrial delay is very short and that the case was prioritized, I conclude that the delay is reasonable and that there are no grounds for a stay of proceedings.

[79]                          In the end, I am of the view that both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal erred in finding that the respondent’s right to be tried within a reasonable time had been infringed.

VI.         Disposition

[80]                          For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the stay of proceedings and remand the case to another judge of the Court of Québec for the continuation of the trial.

 

English version of the reasons delivered by

 

                    Côté J. —

I.               Overview

[81]                        This appeal concerns the interaction between the culture shift introduced by this Court since R. v. Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631, the presumptive ceilings within which an accused must be brought to trial, and the situation — not contemplated by Jordan — in which a new trial is ordered. We must propose a pragmatic solution that respects the right of an accused to be tried within a reasonable time while also remaining true to the principles established in Jordan when analyzing delay in the context of a retrial.

[82]                          In rendering its decision in Jordan on July 8, 2016, this Court reaffirmed the fundamental right of accused persons to be tried within a reasonable time and thoroughly changed the manner in which delay is treated. A change of direction was required to counter the culture of complacency that had developed among Canadian courts. New ceilings were established, and any delay that exceeds these ceilings is now presumptively unreasonable; an accused no longer has to prove prejudice to obtain a stay of proceedings.

[83]                          The corollary to this prospective framework is that it requires a certain level of proactivity from all participants in the justice system. An accused can be faulted for their inaction or lateness in taking action. Illegitimate conduct by an accused that is contrary to the values promoted by Jordan may justify attributing a portion of the delay to them.

[84]                        Of course, the Court’s purpose in Jordan was not to provide second‑rate justice to accused persons, but rather to ensure that their constitutional right to be tried within a reasonable time, guaranteed by s. 11(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, is respected. Where the prosecution breaches its duty and infringes this fundamental right, a stay of proceedings is the only possible remedy (R. v. Rahey, 1987 CanLII 52 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 588, at p. 614; Jordan, at paras. 35 and 47; R. v. Cody, 2017 SCC 31, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 659, at para. 24).

II.            Analysis

[85]                          I will say from the outset that I agree with the main principles in the analysis of my colleague Wagner C.J., including the fact that in Jordan the Court did not discuss how the ceilings would apply in the context of a retrial and that it is not necessary to set new ceilings. I also accept the two factors he proposes to consider in the analysis of the reasonableness of delay following an order for a new trial, where the delay is below the applicable presumptive ceiling. I agree that retrials should, generally, take less time than first trials and that retrials should be prioritized. My colleague’s approach makes it possible, among other things, to fulfil the purpose for which a new trial is ordered, as such a trial might otherwise be “stillborn” (Chief Justice’s reasons, at para. 56). I have no reservations in endorsing that approach, for the future. It reflects the culture shift required by Jordan and provides a pragmatic solution; it clarifies how an order for a new trial affects the calculation of delay, while retaining the ceilings established in Jordan. I will also say that I would most likely agree with my colleague’s conclusion if the issue of reasonableness of delay arose in a situation where a new trial was ordered and all of the delay in the first trial was subsequent to Jordan. However, that is not the case here.

[86]                          Therefore, with great respect, I disagree with the result reached by my colleague, namely that the accused cannot obtain a stay of proceedings. I would dismiss the appeal and uphold the stay of proceedings entered by the trial judge (2019 QCCQ 1236) and upheld by the Court of Appeal (2020 QCCA 666) because of a key feature of this case: the accused’s first trial had been completed and judgment had been reserved by the time this Court rendered its decision in Jordan. I will explain.

[87]                          As my colleague aptly states at para. 68 of his reasons, the Jordan ceilings are merely presumptive. If they are exceeded, it is open to the prosecution to try to rebut the presumption and show that the delay is reasonable (Jordan, at paras. 68 et seq.). Conversely, the defence may attempt to rebut the presumption of reasonableness and show that the delay is unreasonable despite being below the ceiling (Jordan, at paras. 82 et seq.).

[88]                        This presumption of reasonableness may be rebutted through a contextual analysis of delay in which first‑trial delay can be considered, as my colleague states (para. 73). In my view, this is one of the exceptional cases in which a stay of proceedings must be entered even though the accused did not raise the infringement of s. 11(b) until after a retrial was ordered. The specific context of the transition from the framework established in R. v. Morin, 1992 CanLII 89 (SCC), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 771, to the Jordan framework created an exceptional circumstance that justifies taking the delay of the first trial into account. When the first‑trial delay is considered in assessing the reasonableness of the retrial delay, the presumption that the delay is reasonable is rebutted, notwithstanding the fact that the retrial delay is below the presumptive ceiling (see Chief Justice’s reasons, at paras. 68 and 73).

[89]                          To begin with, silence alone cannot be held against the accused; he does not have to assert his right in order for it to exist (Chief Justice’s reasons, at paras. 43‑52). An accused may choose not to raise an infringement of s. 11(b) at a first trial and decide instead to tolerate the delay, particularly if they believe they will be acquitted. Seeking an acquittal cannot be viewed as inaction that amounts to illegitimate defence conduct.

[90]                          Nor do I think that the accused can be faulted for not raising delay in the Court of Appeal, for two reasons. First, he was acquitted at trial. It was the Crown that appealed the case. What then could be reasonably expected of the accused? He had to fight to have the appeal dismissed and the verdict of acquittal upheld. It seems to me that to hold otherwise is a disguised way of reproaching him for wanting an acquittal rather than a stay of proceedings, despite the fact that seeking an acquittal is not a legal strategy.

[91]                          Second, choosing to raise the issue of delay after trial, in the alternative, would not have been a good defence strategy, especially since, as my colleague says, “only exceptionally will an accused be able to raise this issue for the first time on appeal” (para. 37). In this regard, I agree with the general principles stated by my colleague with respect to new arguments raised for the first time on appeal. Other than in exceptional circumstances, it is not appropriate, once on appeal, to raise the delay in a trial that has come to an end. Appeal courts generally regard the fact that a s. 11(b) motion for a stay of proceedings is brought for the first time on appeal as being “fatal” to the motion (R. v. Rabba (1991), 1991 CanLII 7073 (ON CA), 64 C.C.C. (3d) 445 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 447). In M.G. v. R., 2019 QCCA 1170, the Quebec Court of Appeal stated that this is [translation] “fatal” largely because bringing such a motion is improper given that the trial judge had no opportunity to assess the evidence and facts in support of it (para. 42).

[92]                          As the intervener the Association québécoise des avocats et avocates de la défense quite rightly noted, faulting an accused for not raising such an issue on appeal, while at the same time suggesting that it is improper to do so, creates a no‑win situation for the accused. Such a situation is, moreover, especially detrimental to an accused who has been acquitted:

      [translation] Appeal courts ordinarily find that new grounds of appeal may not be raised in the absence of a factual analysis or decision by a trial judge. Similarly, it would be unthinkable for an accused who is acquitted to be able to file a cross‑appeal on an issue that has never been raised. An accused who is acquitted has no right of appeal, yet this is the criticism made by the [Crown] against the [accused].

      (I.F., at para. 23)

[93]                          It is therefore problematic to assert that the accused did not raise delay in a timely manner, given the fact that he was acquitted at trial and that he was, all things considered, restricted by law from raising it on appeal. At what point could he allege an infringement of his Charter right? Does an accused have to choose between the right to an acquittal, which flows from the presumption of innocence also guaranteed by the Charter, and the right to be tried within a reasonable time?

[94]                        Accordingly, and with respect, the result reached by my colleague strikes me as harsh and seems to disregard a fundamental fact: the accused’s first trial had been completed and judgment had been reserved by the time this Court rendered its decision in Jordan on July 8, 2016. In my view, the delay in this case is markedly longer than it reasonably should have been. The fact that the retrial delay is below the presumptive ceiling does not protect all of the delay from the application of s. 11(b). The specific context of the transition from the subjective Morin framework to the prospective Jordan framework created an exceptional circumstance that justifies upholding the stay of proceedings.

[95]                        In reality, it has been more than 11 years since the respondent was charged, and his fate has still not been conclusively determined. Certain facts must be recalled. The delay from the first trial is 63 months and 8 days (1,924 days), only 1 day of which is attributable to the defence. A period of 38 days qualifies as a discrete event: the accused’s counsel was appointed to the bench, which caused a delay. The net first‑trial delay is therefore 62 months. The accused was charged on February 8, 2011, his trial ended on May 16, 2016, and judgment was reserved prior to Jordan. It was not until February 10, 2017 that the verdict was finally rendered: the accused was acquitted of all the charges against him. The Crown appealed the acquittal, and on June 13, 2018, the Court of Appeal ordered a new trial. Between June and November 2018, the accused did not know who would represent him at his new trial. An agreement was not reached until November 21, 2018, when the accused’s counsel who represented him in the Court of Appeal accepted a mandate to defend him at the new trial. Just over a month later, on December 28, 2018, the accused filed his motion for a stay of proceedings for unreasonable delay.

[96]                          The Crown’s conduct following the order for a new trial warrants further comment. The delay between the order and the anticipated end date for the retrial, May 31, 2019, was 11 months. However, it was not until the accused filed his motion for a stay of proceedings that the prosecution, for the first time since 2011, adopted a proactive stance and took the necessary steps to move up the accused’s retrial. The anticipated retrial delay then became 10 months and 5 days. However, in this case, even such a delay below the presumptive ceiling does not make it possible to disregard the first‑trial delay.

[97]                          Although the charges involved are serious, this is not a complex case with an abundance of evidence. While the accused made sure that he had all the evidence in his possession in order to avoid a possible postponement of the trial, in addition to accepting the first dates available, the prosecution’s actions are difficult to reconcile with the proactivity that is now expected of it. Despite the fact that the evidence already existed, the accused’s counsel struggled to gain access to it.

[98]                          By the time a new trial was ordered on June 13, 2018, nearly two years had passed since Jordan. Not only was the Crown well aware of its obligations, but in addition, earlier dates were offered as soon as the motion for a stay of proceedings was served. Yet the retrial was treated [translation] “in the same manner as if it were a first trial” (R.F., at para. 94).

[99]                          It seems to me that such a situation corresponds perfectly to the circumstances referred to by my colleague at para. 73 of his reasons. The Crown failed to prioritize the accused’s case. In this context, even a delay of 10 months and 5 days in a non‑complex case like this one is sufficiently long to justify taking the first‑trial delay into account. Moreover, I note that such a situation is unlikely to happen again, as Jordan was decided more than five years ago. The fact remains that the system failed to try the accused in a diligent and reasonable manner. The stay of proceedings must be upheld; excessive delays cannot be tolerated.

[100]                     I cannot fault the accused for not acting proactively and filing a motion for a stay of proceedings before the end of his first trial. He had a right to have the trial completed and to obtain an acquittal. Fighting to secure an acquittal is a right, not a strategy. Nor can I bring myself to fault the accused for not acting in keeping with a culture shift that had not occurred at the time of the events. As I have said, the new framework is prospective. Not only had the culture shift not yet taken place, but the conduct of the prosecution and the court was the primary cause of the delay in the first trial. If the accused may not benefit from the delay he causes to obtain a stay of proceedings, it stands to reason that the prosecution cannot wipe the slate clean of the 62 months of first‑trial delay attributable to it simply because the constitutional clock is reset “to zero” (Chief Justice’s reasons, at para. 60).

[101]                     At the risk of repeating myself, it took 62 months to complete a trial that was supposed to last 2 days. More than eight months were then needed to reach a verdict of acquittal. A new trial was subsequently ordered, on the application of the Crown, because of errors in the trial judgment. Apart from the 39 days mentioned above, the accused’s conduct was beyond reproach between the charges in February 2011 and the order for a new trial in June 2018. Once his counsel was mandated, the motion for a stay of proceedings was filed little more than a month later, in December 2018. The accused cannot be faulted for not acting in a timely manner: in nearly 8 years of proceedings, only a period of 39 days from the first trial can be attributed to him.

[102]                     In my view, the accused is entitled to a stay of proceedings. He was a victim of the culture of complacency specifically addressed by Jordan. Given the uncertainty of the previous Morin framework, the fact that the accused did not move for a stay of proceedings cannot be held against him. He had a right to have the trial completed and to obtain an acquittal. This is a case in which the presumption that the delay is reasonable is rebutted. To conclude otherwise would be to lay on the accused’s shoulders the prosecution’s failure to bring him to trial in a manner respectful of his fundamental rights.

III.         Conclusion

[103]                     I would dismiss the appeal and uphold the stay of proceedings.

                    Kasirer J. —

I.               Overview

[1]                              Following a party at which he had consumed alcohol and “magic mushrooms”, Matthew Winston Brown violently attacked Janet Hamnett, a person he did not know and who had done nothing to invite the assault. At the time, Mr. Brown was in what the trial judge described as a “substance intoxication delirium” that was so extreme as to be “akin to automatism” (2020 ABQB 166, 9 Alta. L.R. (7th) 375, at para. 87). While capable of physical movement, he was in a delusional state and had no willed control over his actions. Mr. Brown’s extreme intoxication akin to automatism was brought about by his voluntary ingestion of the magic mushrooms which contained a drug called psilocybin. Mr. Brown was acquitted at trial. The Alberta Court of Appeal set aside that verdict and convicted him of the general intent offence of aggravated assault.

[2]                              At common law, automatism is “a state of impaired consciousness, rather than unconsciousness, in which an individual, though capable of action, has no voluntary control over that action” (R. v. Stone, 1999 CanLII 688 (SCC), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 290, at para. 156). It is sometimes said that the effect of automatism is to provoke physical involuntariness whereby there is no connection between mind and body (see Rabey v. The Queen, 1980 CanLII 44 (SCC), [1980] 2 S.C.R. 513, at p. 518). Examples often given include the involuntary physical movement of an individual who has suffered a heart attack or seizure. Conduct that is involuntary in this sense cannot be criminal (see R. v. Luedecke, 2008 ONCA 716, 93 O.R. (3d) 89, at paras. 53‑56, relying in particular on Rabey, at p. 519, per Ritchie J., and at p. 545, per Dickson J., as he then was, dissenting but not on this point).

[3]                              Mr. Brown’s appeal before this Court turns on the circumstances in which persons accused of certain violent crimes can invoke self‑induced extreme intoxication to show that they lacked the general intent or voluntariness ordinarily required to justify a conviction and punishment. Similar matters are at the heart of the Crown appeals in R. v. Sullivan and R. v. Chan, for which judgments are rendered simultaneously with this case (R. v. Sullivan, 2022 SCC 19) (the “Sullivan and Chan appeals”). The Court is asked in all three cases to decide upon the constitutionality of An Act to amend the Criminal Code (self‑induced intoxication), S.C. 1995, c. 32 (“Bill C‑72”), in light of, on the one hand, the principles of fundamental justice and the presumption of innocence guaranteed to the accused by ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and, on the other, Parliament’s aims to protect victims of intoxicated violence, in particular women and children, and hold perpetrators to account.

[4]                              These are not drunkenness cases. The accused in each of these appeals consumed drugs which, they argued, taken alone or in combination with alcohol, provoked psychotic, delusional and involuntary conduct, which are reactions not generally associated with drunkenness. As I note below, there is good reason to believe Parliament understood that alcohol alone is unlikely to bring about the delusional state akin to automatism it sought to regulate in enacting s. 33.1 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46. As Lauwers J.A. wrote in R. v. Sullivan, 2020 ONCA 333, 151 O.R. (3d) 353, “it is not clear that extreme alcohol intoxication causes non-mental disorder automatism as a matter of basic science” (para. 288). In any event, these reasons say nothing about criminal liability for violent conduct produced by alcohol alone short of the psychotic state akin to automatism experienced by Mr. Brown and spoken to by the trial judge. I specifically leave intact the common law rule that drunkenness, absent clear scientific evidence of automatism, is not a defence to general intent crimes, including crimes of violence such as sexual assault.

[5]                              It thus bears emphasizing that Mr. Brown was not simply drunk or high. To be plain: it is the law in Canada that intoxication short of automatism is not a defence to the kind of violent crime at issue here. The outcome of the constitutional questions in these appeals has no impact on the rule that intoxication short of automatism is not a defence to violent crimes of general intent in this country.

[6]                              Parliament added s. 33.1 largely in response to R. v. Daviault, 1994 CanLII 61 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 63. In that case, the Court confirmed the common law rule that intoxication is not a defence to crimes of general intent. The majority in Daviault recognized, however, that the Charter mandated an exception to the common law rule: where intoxication is so extreme that an accused falls into a condition akin to automatism, a conviction for the offence charged would violate ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter. It would be unfair, reasoned the Court, to hold an individual responsible for crimes committed while in a state of automatism, as they are incapable of voluntarily committing a guilty act or of having a guilty mind.

[7]                              Crown counsel in this appeal and the Sullivan and Chan appeals recall that the Daviault exception was met with public incomprehension and disapproval. In dissent, Sopinka J. anticipated this grievance when he wrote that those who voluntarily render themselves intoxicated and then violently cause bodily harm to others are “far from blameless” (p. 128). In order to address the constitutional failings identified by the majority of the Court in a manner that would properly reflect the blameworthiness of the extremely self‑intoxicated accused identified by the dissent, Parliament enacted s. 33.1. The new provision purported to remove the defence of automatism for the extremely self-intoxicated accused and put in place a constitutionally‑compliant measure of criminal fault for the underlying violent offence. The Crown and the intervening attorneys general urge us to interpret s. 33.1 as validly imposing liability for violent crimes based on a standard of criminal negligence that would answer the violations of the Charter pointed to in Daviault.

[8]                              But the impugned provision of the Criminal Code does not establish a proper measure of criminal fault by reason of intoxication. Instead, s. 33.1 imposes liability for the violent offence if an accused interferes with the bodily integrity of another “while” in a state of self‑induced intoxication rendering them incapable of consciously controlling their behaviour. Section 33.1 treats extreme voluntary intoxication, foreseeable or otherwise, as a condition of liability for the underlying violent offence and not as a measure of fault based on criminal negligence.

[9]                              Accordingly, the accused risks conviction for the relevant general intent offence — in Mr. Brown’s case, for aggravated assault — based on conduct that occurred while they are incapable of committing the guilty act (the actus reus) or of having the guilty mind (mens rea) required to justify conviction and punishment. They are not being held to account for their conduct undertaken as free agents, including the choice to ingest an intoxicant undertaken when neither the risk of automatism nor the risk of harm was necessarily foreseeable. Instead, the accused is called to answer for the general intent crime that they cannot voluntarily or wilfully commit, an offence for which the whole weight of the criminal law and ss. 7 and 11(d) say they may be morally innocent. To deprive a person of their liberty for that involuntary conduct committed in a state akin to automatism — conduct that cannot be criminal — violates the principles of fundamental justice in a system of criminal justice based on personal responsibility for one’s actions. On its face, not only does the text of s. 33.1 fail to provide a constitutionally compliant fault for the underlying offence set out in its third paragraph, it creates what amounts to a crime of absolute liability.

[10]                          I hasten to say that there may well have been other paths for Parliament to achieve its legitimate aims connected to combatting extreme intoxicated violence. The sense that an accused who acts violently in a state of extreme self‑induced intoxication is morally blameworthy is by no means beyond the proper reach of the criminal law. Protecting the victims of violent crime — particularly in light of the equality and dignity interests of women and children who are vulnerable to intoxicated sexual and domestic violence — is a pressing and substantial social purpose. And as I shall endeavour to show, it was not impermissible for Parliament to enact legislation seeking to hold an extremely intoxicated person accountable for a violent crime when they chose to create the risk of harm by ingesting intoxicants.

[11]                          The alternatives to the constitutionally fragile s. 33.1 strike different balances between individual rights and societal interests and, no doubt, each has advantages and shortcomings as a matter of social policy. Some of these options would be manifestly fairer to the accused while achieving some, if not all, of Parliament’s objectives. I am mindful that it is not the role of the courts to set social policy, much less draft legislation for Parliament, as courts are not institutionally designed for these tasks. But it is relevant to the analysis that follows that, as noted by the majority in Daviault itself (p. 100) and by the majority of the Court of Appeal in Sullivan (para. 132), it would likely be open to Parliament to establish a stand‑alone offence of criminal intoxication. Others, including the voir dire judge in this very case (2019 ABQB 770, at para. 80 (CanLII)), have suggested liability for the underlying offence would be possible if the legal standard of criminal negligence required proof that both of the risks of a loss of control and of the harm that follows were reasonably foreseeable. In either of these ways, Parliament would be enacting a law rooted in a “moral instinct” that says a person who chooses to become extremely intoxicated may fairly be held responsible for creating a situation where they threaten the physical integrity of others (I borrow the phrase “moral instinct” from Professors M. Plaxton and C. Mathen, “What’s Right With Section 33.1” (2021), 25 Can. Crim. L.R. 255, at p. 257).

[12]                          Parliament did not enact a new offence of dangerous intoxication, nor did it adopt a new mode of liability for existing violent offences based on a proper standard of criminal negligence. With the utmost respect, I am bound to conclude the path Parliament chose in enacting s. 33.1 was not, from the point of view of ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter, constitutionally compliant. I am unable to agree with what the Minister of Justice asserted on the third reading of s. 33.1 in Parliament: “. . . the approach taken in Bill C‑72 is fundamentally fair, both to the victims of violence and to those accused of crime” (House of Commons Debates (“Hansard”), vol. 133, No. 224, 1st Sess., 35th Parl., June 22, 1995, at p. 14470).

[13]                          The violations of the rights of the accused in respect of the principles of fundamental justice and the presumption of innocence occasioned by s. 33.1 are grave. Notwithstanding Parliament’s laudable purpose, s. 33.1 is not saved by s. 1 of the Charter. The legitimate goals of protecting the victims of these crimes and holding the extremely self-intoxicated accountable, compelling as they are, do not justify these infringements of the Charter that so fundamentally upset the tenets of the criminal law. With s. 33.1, Parliament has created a meaningful risk of conviction and punishment of an extremely intoxicated person who, while perhaps blameworthy in some respect, is innocent of the offence as charged according to the requirements of the Constitution.

[14]                          In the case of Mr. Brown, and on the strength of the findings of fact at trial, the conclusion may be plainly stated. Mr. Brown might well be reproached for choosing to drink alcohol and ingest magic mushrooms prior to the harm suffered by Ms. Hamnett, but that blame cannot ground criminal liability for the aggravated assault that occurred while he was in a state of delirium akin to automatism. On a constitutional standard, he did not commit the guilty act of aggravated assault voluntarily and he was incapable of forming even the minimally‑required degree of mens rea required for conviction of that offence. In my respectful view, to punish him in these circumstances, however exceptional they might be, would be intolerable in a free and democratic society. The law imposes the solemn and onerous duty on this Court to declare s. 33.1 unconstitutional (see Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, 1985 CanLII 81 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486 (“Motor Vehicle Reference”), at p. 497). For the reasons that follow, I would set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal, declare s. 33.1 to be of no force and effect pursuant to s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, and restore Mr. Brown’s acquittal rendered at trial.

II.            Background

[15]                          At a friend’s house party on a January night in Calgary, Mr. Brown had six or seven mixed drinks, a few beers and consumed several one‑half gram or smaller portions of magic mushrooms. He was 26 years old and in his last year of university and was aware that psilocybin in magic mushrooms is an illegal drug that can bring about hallucinations. He had tried magic mushrooms once before and believed that they generally gave a “fuzzy but positive feeling” (trial reasons, at para. 38).

[16]                          As Mr. Brown would testify at his trial, at around 1:30 a.m. he felt “wonky” and began to “los[e] [his] grip on reality” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 13). Without any memory of having done so, Mr. Brown removed his clothing and left the house in an agitated state at around 3:45 a.m., running naked and barefoot into the cold winter night. His friends searched for him for about 10 to 15 minutes and then called the police.

[17]                          In a nearby house, Janet Hamnett was awoken around 4:00 a.m. by a loud noise. When she went to investigate, Ms. Hamnett was attacked by someone she did not know who she later described as a huge presence screaming at the top of his lungs. The intruder was Mr. Brown. Ms. Hamnett fell to the ground and put her arms up as he beat her repeatedly with a broken broom handle. With her head, face and arms covered in blood, she managed to get to a bathroom and lock the door. Mr. Brown left the house and continued into the street. When all appeared quiet Ms. Hamnett sought refuge at a neighbour’s house, at which time the police were called. The attack left her with cuts and contusions, as well as broken bones in her right hand which resulted in permanent injuries. She also suffered psychological harm from the incident.

[18]                          At about 5:00 a.m., Mr. Brown broke into the Varshney residence a kilometer away by throwing a heavy object through the front door window. Mr. and Mrs. Varshney, who did not know Mr. Brown, heard screaming and the sound of breaking glass. They were able to take shelter in their bedroom and call the police. The police found Mr. Brown lying naked on the floor of a bathroom. He was whispering and appeared confused by his surroundings; his feet were visibly bruised and bloodied. Mr. Brown complied with police instructions and was taken for medical care. He recalled coming to in hospital then waking later in a jail cell. Mr. Brown later said he had no memory of what transpired at either of the two homes.

[19]                          Mr. Brown had no previous criminal record and no history of mental illness. He was charged with one count of breaking and entering Ms. Hamnett’s home and committing the indictable offence of aggravated assault and one count of breaking and entering the Varshney home and committing the indictable offence of mischief to property over $5,000.

[20]                          At trial, Mr. Brown argued that he was not guilty of the offences charged by reason of automatism. He claimed to have been so impaired by the consumption of psilocybin that his actions were involuntary and that he did not have the necessary mens rea for conviction of aggravated assault or mischief to property. Expert evidence adduced at trial confirmed that that the psilocybin was the “clear causative factor” for what was described as the accused’s delirium (trial reasons, at para. 73). On the basis of this evidence, Mr. Brown was said to have no voluntary control over his conduct at the time.

[21]                          The Crown invoked s. 33.1 as a means of precluding Mr. Brown from relying on self‑induced intoxication akin to automatism as a defence to the charge of aggravated assault. Mr. Brown answered that, insofar as it prevented him from raising automatism as a defence, s. 33.1 violated ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter and could not be saved by s. 1. He said that the defence should be available to him against both charges, including the offence relating to the aggravated assault to which s. 33.1 purportedly applied.

III.         Proceedings Below

A.           Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench

(1)         The Constitutional Ruling, 2019 ABQB 770 (deWit J.)

[22]                          In a judgment rendered following a voir dire, deWit J. concluded that s. 33.1 violated the principles of fundamental justice and the presumption of innocence guaranteed by the Charter and was not otherwise justified pursuant to s. 1.

[23]                          The voir dire judge observed that s. 33.1 “does not deal with the consequence of criminal acts” but “simply eliminates any evidence and argument regarding the mens rea and voluntariness of the accused” (paras. 29‑30). He concluded that s. 33.1 allows for a conviction in the absence of proof that the underlying violent offence was intended or committed voluntarily, contrary to s. 7 of the Charter (para. 31). Instead, the provision operates akin to a regime of absolute liability. He further held that s. 33.1 enables conviction even where there is a reasonable doubt about the essential elements of the charged offence, contrary to s. 11(d) (para. 37).

[24]                          He then held that these limits cannot be reasonably justified in a free and democratic society. The judge did recognize that the provision had pressing and substantial objectives relevant to s. 1 of the Charter. Section 33.1 was not, however, minimally impairing, as there were less harmful means of assuring Parliament’s protection and accountability objectives (para. 80). For the voir dire judge, the deleterious effects of s. 33.1 outweighed its benefits. Section 33.1’s primary flaw is that it offends “sacrosanct” principles of the legal system designed to avoid convicting the morally innocent (para. 89). This negative effect outweighs the benefits of the law, especially when Parliament could have adopted a better‑tailored rule bearing on the consumption of intoxicants and their effects.

[25]                          The voir dire judge declared s. 33.1 to be of no force and effect pursuant to s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. As a result, Mr. Brown was entitled to raise the defence of extreme intoxication akin to automatism that s. 33.1 purported to exclude.

(2)         Reasons for Judgment on the Merits, 2020 ABQB 166, 9 Alta. L.R. (7th) 375 (Hollins J.)

[26]                          At trial, Mr. Brown led evidence in support of the defence of extreme intoxication akin to automatism. Hollins J. held that every material piece of evidence supported a finding of automatism.

[27]                          The trial judge found that Mr. Brown was in a state of delirium due to his consumption of psilocybin, “which meant that he was not acting voluntarily in the commission of these offences nor with knowledge of his acts” (para. 34). Expert testimony was adduced that Mr. Brown’s conduct was involuntary at the time of the offences and he had no conscious control over or awareness of his actions. A forensic psychologist, Dr. Thomas Dalby, stated that Mr. Brown’s delirium was caused by the psilocybin and that his reaction was “unanticipated” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 318). An expert in pharmocology, Dr. Mark Yarema, agreed that psilocybin can “induce a state akin to legal automatism” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 241). In his view, Mr. Brown’s actions were those of someone “who has lost touch with reality, does not have a normal level of consciousness, and does not have voluntary control over their actions” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 242).

[28]                          Hollins J. accepted these conclusions as well as the evidence of other witnesses who testified, including the victims, who were all credible in her view. The defence was an answer to the property‑based offence at common law and was available for the charge relating to the aggravated assault given that s. 33.1 had been declared of no force and effect by her colleague, deWit J. Accordingly, she entered acquittals on both counts of the indictment.

B.            Court of Appeal of Alberta, 2021 ABCA 273, 30 Alta. L.R. (7th) 1 (Slatter, Khullar and Hughes JJ.A.)

[29]                          In separate opinions written by Slatter, Khullar and Hughes JJ.A., the Court of Appeal reversed deWit J.’s declaration that s. 33.1 was of no force or effect. The court set aside the acquittal on the first count and entered a conviction on the included offence of aggravated assault. The acquittal on the mischief charge, unaffected by s. 33.1, was not appealed.

[30]                          Slatter and Hughes JJ.A. both held that the voir dire judge had erred in concluding that s. 33.1 violated ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter.

[31]                          For Slatter J.A., the Supreme Court had “expressly invited Parliament to do exactly what it did, namely legislate to fill the gap created by Daviault, contemplating that the result would comply with s. 7” (para. 14). Slatter J.A. saw no breach of the principle of voluntariness because it was acceptable for Parliament to criminalize voluntary intoxication in situations where a self‑created risk of harm is objectively foreseeable. He further held that there was no breach of the constitutional requirement of mens rea because s. 33.1 adopts the marked departure standard, which has been accepted as a sufficient measure of fault, in particular in R. v. Creighton, 1993 CanLII 61 (SCC), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 3. All that is constitutionally required is an “objectively foreseeable risk of personal injury” (para. 26 (emphasis in original)). Finally, Parliament had not improperly substituted proof of extreme intoxication for proof of the essential elements of the charged offence because s. 33.1 simply “redefined” the mens rea for general intent offences (para. 27). Slatter J.A. concluded that by “self‑administering a dangerous drug”, a person is responsible for the objectively foreseeable risks associated with self‑induced intoxication (para. 30). “It follows”, he wrote, “that there is nothing unconstitutional about Parliament establishing criminal fault based on the risks inherent in self-intoxication” (para. 34).

[32]                          In the alternative, wrote Slatter J.A., s. 33.1 would be saved under s. 1. Protecting citizens from violent crimes and holding violent citizens accountable, as specific purposes, can be acknowledged as pressing and substantial, in addition to “the general purpose of the criminal law of protecting core social values” (para. 61). The provision has clear benefits: it affirms fundamental societal values about protecting women and children, it restores confidence in the justice system, it encourages the reporting of crime, and it denounces and deters the use of illegal substances. These outweigh any deleterious effects. “No one who is truly morally innocent is impacted”, he wrote (para. 81). He concluded that “it is demonstrably justifiable to hold persons like [Mr. Brown] accountable for their decisions to consume substances known to affect human behaviour” (para. 85). Slatter J.A. concluded that the appeal should be allowed, the declaration of unconstitutionality set aside, and a conviction should be entered for aggravated assault.

[33]                          In concurring reasons, Hughes J.A. wrote that s. 33.1 requires a measure of fault that reflects a marked departure from the standard of care of a reasonable person. No substitution breach arose under the provision because Parliament created an alternative level of objective fault. Accused persons can still raise a reasonable doubt about whether the intoxication was self‑induced or unforeseen. There is no Charter breach. If she were wrong in this view, Hughes J.A. would agree with her colleagues that s. 33.1 is saved by s. 1.

[34]                          In her reasons concurring in the result, Khullar J.A. found breaches of ss. 7 and 11(d) but decided that the provision could be upheld under s. 1. In respect of the prima facie breach, she relied on the reasons of Paciocco J.A. in Sullivan that s. 33.1 allows conviction even though the conduct of the offence was not voluntary (para. 168, citing Sullivan at paras. 64‑74) and, as such, it violated a principle of fundamental justice constitutionally mandated by the Charter. Relying further on Sullivan, Khullar J.A. noted that s. 33.1 fails to satisfy the minimum mens rea required by the Charter (para. 168, citing Sullivan, at paras. 79‑94). Section 33.1 infringed s. 11(d) of the Charter to the extent that it allows an accused to be found guilty despite a reasonable doubt whether they had the mens rea required by the offence.

[35]                          Khullar J.A. concluded however that the provision could be saved under s. 1. She stated that the justification analysis was a “hard and close case” but that Parliament’s choice was a defensible one in light of the options it reviewed (para. 166).

[36]                          For Khullar J.A., Parliament had pressing and substantial objectives relating to accountability and protection in enacting s. 33.1. She disagreed with the view, expressed by the majority in Sullivan, that the accountability purpose is constitutionally impermissible. She was of the view that the majority in Sullivan confused the purpose of the provision with its effects (para. 184). Turning to the proportionality leg of the s. 1 test, Khullar J.A. found that the means were rationally connected to these objectives. Section 33.1 serves as a deterrent and strengthens a social ethos that disapproves of excessive intoxication leading to violence.

[37]                          Khullar J.A. observed that the provision might have been drafted using the modified objective test described by the voir dire judge which would have been “less problematic” (para. 197). Parliament was, however, owed deference in its choice for the difficult moral issues. Thus, s. 33.1 passed the minimal impairment stage of the Oakes test (R. v. Oakes, 1986 CanLII 46 (SCC), [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103).

[38]                          At the final balancing stage, Khullar J.A. acknowledged that there are “serious and troubling negative effects of s. 33.1” in that it allows conviction for violent crimes even where the conduct constituting the actus reus is not voluntary and the accused does not possess the mens rea required for the general intent offence (para. 201). However, the important benefits outweigh these deleterious effects, including the protection of women and children that “breathes some meaning into the equality rights of victims” (para. 202). It also deters the irresponsible use and mixing of intoxicants that could lead to automatism and violent behaviour (para. 204): “Parliament is entitled to craft a legislative response regardless of how often an accused would fall within s. 33.1” (para. 207).

[39]                          In conclusion, Khullar J.A. adopted Slatter J.A.’s disposition of the matter. The Court entered a conviction for aggravated assault.

IV.         Issue

[40]                          The only issue is whether s. 33.1 violates ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter and, if so, whether it can be saved under s. 1.

[41]                          Section 33.1 provides:

33.1 (1) It is not a defence to an offence referred to in subsection (3) that the accused, by reason of self-induced intoxication, lacked the general intent or the voluntariness required to commit the offence, where the accused departed markedly from the standard of care as described in subsection (2).

 

(2) For the purposes of this section, a person departs markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society and is thereby criminally at fault where the person, while in a state of self-induced intoxication that renders the person unaware of, or incapable of consciously controlling, their behaviour, voluntarily or involuntarily interferes or threatens to interfere with the bodily integrity of another person.

 

(3) This section applies in respect of an offence under this Act or any other Act of Parliament that includes as an element an assault or any other interference or threat of interference by a person with the bodily integrity of another person.

V.           Analysis

A.           Intoxication and Criminal Liability

[42]                          While Mr. Brown was convicted of aggravated assault, it is of central importance to recall that s. 33.1 blocks the defence of automatism for all general intent crimes designated in s. 33.1(3), including sexual assault and some other forms of gendered violence. Intoxicated sexual assault was in issue in Leary v. The Queen, 1977 CanLII 2 (SCC), [1978] 1 S.C.R. 29, R. v. Bernard, 1988 CanLII 22 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 833, and Daviault. Domestic and sexual violence have had, as the preamble of Bill C‑72 makes plain, a “particularly disadvantag[eous] impact on the equal participation of women and children in society” and Parliament was especially concerned not to allow voluntary intoxication to “excuse” violence against women and children. It is not only important that this preoccupation be recognized as legitimate, but that it be understood as having shaped arguments challenging the provision (see I. Grant, “Second Chances: Bill C-72 and the Charter” (1995), 33 Osgoode Hall L.J. 379).

[43]                          The common law has developed an unsympathetic view towards offenders who argue that their intoxication rendered them incapable of forming the necessary guilty mind. In principle, intoxication does not allow the guilty to evade the stigma of proper conviction or the exacting of fair punishment in Canadian law. Intoxication short of automatism is never a defence to crimes of general intent, including manslaughter, assault, and sexual assault (see Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard, [1920] A.C. 479 (H.L.); Leary, at pp. 57‑60). In Leary, the majority determined that the recklessness involved in becoming drunk was sufficient to find the guilty mind for whatever general intent offence follows. At the time, the Leary rule applied to all degrees of intoxication, including extreme intoxication akin to automatism. Intoxication may only negate fault for crimes of specific intent, such as murder, by reason of the complexity of mens rea required for conviction. It bears repeating: The rule that intoxication is not a defence to general intent crimes remains untouched by this appeal, except in the case of intoxication akin to automatism.

[44]                          The constitutionality of the Leary rule was upheld in Bernard. In concurring reasons, Wilson J. upheld the rule on the basis that the mens rea for sexual assault could be inferred from the commission of the act, notwithstanding drunkenness, where the accused engaged in an “intentional and voluntary” act (p. 883). Wilson J. was quick however to distinguish the facts of Bernard from cases of extreme intoxication akin to automatism. Wilson J. took care to note that, in a case of true automatism, the Leary rule could violate the presumption of innocence by substituting the fault of becoming drunk for the fault of the charged offence (pp. 889‑90).

[45]                          It bears recalling, then, that most degrees of intoxication do not provide a defence to crimes of general intent like the offence of aggravated assault from which Mr. Brown was convicted on appeal. Only the highest form of intoxication — that which results in a person losing voluntary control of their actions — is at issue here: extreme intoxication akin to automatism as a defence to violent crimes of general intent and, then again only intoxication that is self-induced.

[46]                          The defence of automatism denies the element of voluntariness and therefore negates the actus reus of the offence (R. v. Chaulk, 1990 CanLII 34 (SCC), [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1303, at p. 1321; R. v. Parks, 1992 CanLII 78 (SCC), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 871, at p. 896). Involuntary conduct is understood to be genuinely exculpatory because, while the prohibited act was harmful, the accused lacks the capacity to answer for what they did (J. Gardner, Offences and Defences: Selected Essays in the Philosophy of Criminal Law (2007), at p. 142). A physically involuntary act, however wrongful in outward appearance, is not a guilty act that can be imputed to an accused.

[47]                          Automatism is reflected in involuntary movements that may be associated with heart attacks, seizures or “external” shock, or conditions such as sleepwalking or delirium, where the body moves but there is no link between mind and body (Bratty v. Attorney-General for Northern Ireland, [1963] A.C. 386 (H.L.), at p. 409; Rabey, at p. 523). Physical voluntariness is a principle of fundamental justice and a requirement of all true criminal offences, central to the criminal law’s desire to avoid convicting the morally innocent (Daviault, at p. 74; R. v. Ruzic, 2001 SCC 24, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 687, at paras. 46‑47; R. v. Bouchard-Lebrun, 2011 SCC 58, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 575, at para. 45). Absent a willed movement of the body, the Crown cannot prove the actus reus beyond a reasonable doubt (R. v. Théroux, 1993 CanLII 134 (SCC), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 5, at pp. 17‑18). This is distinguished from moral involuntariness, which describes scenarios where the accused retains conscious control over their body but has no realistic choice but to commit a guilty act (Ruzic, at para. 44).

[48]                          In addition, an automaton cannot form the mens rea, or guilty mind, if their actions are involuntary. Where an accused has no conscious awareness of their movements, they necessarily cannot intend their involuntary acts. Imposing criminal liability in the absence of proof of fault also offends the principles of fundamental justice (Motor Vehicle Reference, at pp. 513‑15).

[49]                          I recall that, in Bernard, Wilson J. wrote that in a case of true intoxication akin to automatism, it may be improper to substitute proof of intention to become intoxicated for proof of intention to commit the violent offence (pp. 889‑90). The choice to become intoxicated through legal or illegal means, a choice that many Canadians make, cannot be said to be the same as an intention to perpetrate the illegal act. The substitution violates the presumption of innocence, because a person can be convicted despite a reasonable doubt about whether the essential elements of the offence have been established (Oakes, at p. 134; R. v. Vaillancourt, 1987 CanLII 2 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636, at p. 656).

[50]                          I note that the defence has been referred to as “rare” in the case law (Daviault, at pp. 92‑93; Sullivan, at para. 118). The Attorney General of Manitoba disputes that and points to instances of violence involving street drugs with known psychosis‑inducing properties. It is certainly plain that intoxicated violence is a serious social problem. Whatever proportion of this phenomenon relates to involuntary conduct, it is notable that extreme intoxication akin to automatism is an exigent defence requiring the accused to show that their consciousness was so impaired as to deprive them of all willed control over their actions. This is not the same as simply waking up with no memory of committing a crime. A failure to remember does not prove that an individual was acting involuntarily. Nor is it the same as suffering a psychotic episode where physical voluntariness remains intact. But even if one were to accept that the defence is a rarity, it hardly seems conclusive to either side of the debate. It is cold comfort to the victim of extreme intoxicated violence that their plight is a rare one. And it is equally chilling to think that denying the defence to a person who is morally and physically incapable of committing a crime is somehow palatable in that it is a rare occurrence.

[51]                          Disagreements concerning the blameworthiness of voluntary intoxication animated the majority and minority opinions in Daviault, which addressed squarely the impact of the Leary rule and the preoccupations of Wilson J. in Bernard on extreme intoxication akin to automatism.

(1)         Daviault

[52]                        Mr. Daviault sexually assaulted an acquaintance after drinking 7 or 8 bottles of beer and 35 ounces of brandy, an amount that would likely cause death or a coma in an ordinary person. The issue was, as a matter of law, whether evidence of extreme self‑induced intoxication akin to automatism could ground a defence to the general intent crime of sexual assault. Cory J. for the majority held that the Leary rule offended ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter in three ways, helpfully explained by Paciocco J.A. in Sullivan as the “voluntariness breach”, the “improper substitution breach” and the “mens rea breach” (Sullivan, at para. 47; Daviault, at pp. 89‑92).

[53]                        The majority was concerned that an accused in a state of extreme intoxication akin to automatism could be convicted for conduct that, by reason of its involuntary character, cannot amount to the actus reus of the offence, for which proof beyond a reasonable doubt must be made. This violation of the criminal law’s voluntariness principle would breach the principles of fundamental justice in s. 7 of the Charter (pp. 91‑92). Moreover, the choice to become intoxicated cannot be properly substituted for the mens rea of the offence charged. Proof of voluntary intoxication does not inevitably lead to the conclusion that the accused had the requisite mental element required for conviction. The improper substitution of proof of self‑induced intoxication for proof of mens rea of the offence is a breach of the presumption of innocence (s. 11(d)) (p. 92). Finally, the majority in Daviault recalled that voluntary intoxication is not a crime and the consequences of self‑induced intoxication may themselves not be voluntary or foreseeable. To convict a person based on self‑induced intoxication means that an accused might not have the constitutionally required minimum mens rea that fits the offence charged and the criminal sanction that attaches thereto. This would violate the principles of fundamental justice in s. 7 of the Charter and constitutes the mens rea breach (ibid.).

[54]                        The majority in Daviault thus modified the rule that intoxication is not a defence to crimes of general intent. Exceptionally, a defence of extreme intoxication akin to automatism, including self‑induced extreme intoxication, could be raised by an accused, although intoxication short of automatism would still not be a defence, as it will not interfere with someone’s ability to form the minimum mental element required for a general intent offence (pp. 99‑101). Cory J. invited Parliament to legislate to meet what he considered to be the rare case of this degree of intoxication, noting that it was “always open to Parliament to fashion a remedy which would make it a crime to commit a prohibited act while drunk” (p. 100).

[55]                        In dissent, Sopinka J. said that self‑induced extreme intoxication cannot be a defence for general intent crimes such as sexual assault. In his view, the principles of fundamental justice could be satisfied if there is a blameworthy mental element and the level of blameworthiness is not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offence (p. 118). Those who voluntarily consume alcohol or drugs and render themselves involuntary are not morally blameless. Sopinka J. wrote that the voluntariness principle must give way as a “perpetrator who by his or her own fault brings about the conditions should not escape punishment” (p. 121).

[56]                        Thus, following Daviault, at common law, an accused was entitled to an acquittal for a general intent offence if they could prove, on a balance of probabilities, that they committed the acts involuntarily, while in a state of extreme intoxication akin to automatism. In order to do so, the accused must adduce expert evidence.

[57]                        In its aftermath, the majority opinion in Daviault was criticized for its “alarming lack of consideration of the social context of sexual assault particularly for women and children” (I. Grant, “The Limits of Daviault” (1995), 33 C.R. (4th) 277, at p. 287; see also M. Shaffer, “R. v. Daviault: A Principled Approach To Drunkenness or A Lapse of Common Sense?” (1996), 3 Rev. Const. Stud. 311, at pp. 324‑27). Professor Grant, for example, argued that alcohol is often implicated in gendered violence, and therefore strong equality protections are necessary (“Second Chances: Bill C‑72 and the Charter”, at p. 389). She wrote that “[t]he suggestion that someone could be too drunk to be convicted of sexual assault shocked the public’s sense of justice and common sense” (p. 383).

(2)         Bill C-72

[58]                          Within a relatively short period following the judgment of this Court in Daviault, Parliament added s. 33.1 to the general part (Part I — General) of the Criminal Code, which sought to abolish self‑induced intoxication akin to automatism as a defence to general intent offences involving violence. The preamble of Bill C‑72, to which I will return, emphasized Parliament’s concerns regarding intoxicated violence and its impact on the equality and security interests of women and children. It also spoke to the moral view that someone who caused harm while voluntarily intoxicated was blameworthy and should be held accountable for that harm.

[59]                          Before the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs in advance of the Bill’s enactment, the Minister of Justice stated that in Daviault, Sopinka J. “wrote a strong judgment for the dissent. . . . He was able to conclude that the moral blameworthiness in the act of inducing your own intoxication was sufficient as a link to criminal liability for the harm charged in the offence” (Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, No. 98, 1st Sess., 35th Parl., April 6, 1995, at p. 17). He stated that the draft amendment provided a sufficient level of fault in that self‑induced intoxication to the point of automatism was a departure from the standard of care (ibid.). In its response to Daviault, Parliament thus sought to supply a link between the intention to become intoxicated and the intention to commit a crime of violence identified by the majority. It endeavoured to do so by legislating the marked departure standard described in s. 33.1(2), which was viewed as avoiding the constitutional infirmities identified by Cory J. and extending the moral and policy reasoning of Sopinka J.’s dissent.

[60]                          Even after Daviault, there is general agreement that a person acting in a state of automatism deserves an acquittal where their loss of control is truly morally blameless. But, to borrow a phrase from the United Kingdom Law Commission, there is a persistent sense shared by many that “it is not fair for there to be an acquittal where the accused may be blamed for whatever led to the loss of control” (Criminal Liability: Insanity and Automatism — A Discussion Paper (2013), at para. 1.117). On this view, a person whose automatism is brought about by self‑induced extreme intoxication should shoulder that blame and the law should not allow them to escape liability for their violent conduct. There is a perceived difference, say, between a person who consumes a spiked drink and, as a result, loses control of their actions and another person who, because they chose to drink or take drugs to excess, falls into a state akin to automatism. At the same time, issues related to agency and automatism are complicated by other factors, including the social problem of addiction that may have a bearing on the question of moral blameworthiness (see, generally, L. Silver, Who is Responsible for Extreme Intoxication?, October 7, 2021 (online); L. M. Kelly and N. Gill, The punishing response to the defence of extreme intoxication, October 13, 2020 (online)). While this bears noting, it is unnecessary to say more on this problem that does not arise on the facts of this appeal or of the Sullivan and Chan appeals before the Court.

[61]                          I take due note that the preamble to Bill C‑72 provides that, in most cases, extreme intoxication akin to automatism is brought about not through the consumption of alcohol alone, but by the consumption of other intoxicants or a mix of alcohol and another substance. For this observation, Parliament relied upon reports and testimony by three experts in support of its conclusion that alcohol alone will not induce a state of automatism. One expert, Dr. Harold Kalant, stated that there was no scientific evidence that alcohol could cause automatism, absent an underlying health condition (Sullivan and Chan appeals, A.R., vol. VI, at pp. 93‑95; see also the evidence of Dr. Kendall and Dr. Bradford in Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, Evidence, No. 161, 1st Sess., 35th Parl., June 13, 1995, at pp. 22‑25). While s. 33.1 refers to intoxication generally, without formally distinguishing between licit or illicit substances, the preamble to Bill C‑72 states that “the Parliament of Canada . . . is aware of scientific evidence that most intoxicants, including alcohol, by themselves, will not cause a person to act involuntarily”.

[62]                          Although both Daviault and Parliament were focussed on “drunkenness”, the parliamentary record and facts of this appeal and the Sullivan and Chan appeals suggest that the defence of extreme intoxication akin to automatism will generally not be relevant in cases involving alcohol alone. The experts in this case explained, with reference to the legal definition of automatism, that psilocybin may induce delusions, psychotic episodes, confusion and disorientation (A.R., vol. III, at pp. 241 and 315). Dr. Kalant, in contrast, testified before Parliament that, normally, alcohol progressively decreases nerve cell activity in the brain until a person becomes both unconscious and incapable of physical movement (Sullivan and Chan appeals, A.R., vol. VI, at p. 93), an effect which would not satisfy the state of impaired conscious and unwilled movements necessary for a true state automatism. Claims of extreme intoxication must, of course, be assessed with reference to the facts and expert evidence adduced at the trial. It would be inappropriate here to foreclose a finding of extreme intoxication through any intoxicant taken alone, if medical and scientific evidence adduced compel such a conclusion.

[63]                          I now turn to the question of whether s. 33.1 infringes ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter, as alleged by Mr. Brown.

B.            Section 33.1 Infringes Sections 7 and 11(d)

(1)         Principal Arguments

[64]                          Mr. Brown says s. 33.1 violates ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter. In its reading of the provision, the Court of Appeal erred in departing from the principles set forth in Daviault. He says that s. 33.1 unfairly extends to situations in which there is no foreseeable risk of violence for the general intent offence to which it applies. It creates a regime for absolute liability by allowing conviction without proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intentionally or voluntarily committed the offence. Section 33.1 therefore improperly substitutes intent to become intoxicated with intent to commit the violent offence. Mr. Brown adds that s. 33.1 also limits s. 7 because it mandates conviction without any contemporaneity between the actus reus and mens rea of a criminal offence.

[65]                          The Crown responds that, when properly interpreted, s. 33.1 complies with the Charter. Under the Crown’s reading, s. 33.1 only punishes the intentional and voluntary consumption of drugs to an extreme level, thus meeting the voluntariness requirement. There is no mens rea breach because s. 33.1 contains a true objective standard and includes objective foresight of harm. There is no improper substitution because s. 33.1 changes the mens rea needed to prove a general intent offence. Parliament was entitled to set standards of behaviour that all in society must follow.

[66]                          The intervening attorneys general say that s. 33.1 has cast a unique mode of liability that provides the necessary ingredients for a constitutionally valid offence. The mental element inherent in s. 33.1(2) reflects the minimum objective fault requirement along the same marked departure standard recognized in cases such as R. v. Hundal, 1993 CanLII 120 (SCC), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 867, Creighton and R. v. Roy, 2012 SCC 26, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 60. Accordingly, s. 33.1 is consistent with ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter because it follows “a blueprint this Court has already endorsed as constitutional” (Condensed Book, A.G. Ontario, at p. 2). Moreover, Parliament can constitutionally preclude intoxication as a defence if it is the gravamen of the offence (R. v. Penno, 1990 CanLII 88 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 865, at p. 891, per Wilson J.). Here, acting on this Court’s invitation in Daviault, Parliament has sought to impose liability for the unintended consequences of a blameworthy predicate act following, in particular, R. v. DeSousa, 1992 CanLII 80 (SCC), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 944.

(2)         Threshold Issue: Internal Balancing Under Section 7

[67]                          As a preliminary matter, the Court must first decide whether the rights of victims of intoxicated violence, in particular the rights of women and children under ss. 7 and 15 of the Charter and alluded to in the preamble to Bill C‑72, should inform the analysis of a possible breach of the accused’s rights under s. 7, or whether it is appropriate to consider these interests specifically at the justification stage under s. 1.

[68]                          The intervener Women’s Legal Education and Action Fund Inc. (LEAF) invites this Court to balance the rights of the accused against the rights of women and children in the s. 7 analysis. It says that, in Daviault, there was no consideration of competing rights at that stage, unlike the clear engagement with equality, security and dignity interests in Bill C‑72. These rights are not simply other social interests that should be “relegated” to the s. 1 justification. Where courts fail to undertake balancing under s. 7 — as the majority of the Court of Appeal did not do in Sullivan, for example — the effect is that, wittingly or unwittingly, they favour individual rights over those of vulnerable groups who disproportionately bear the risk of intoxicated violence. Others, including the Crown and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, depart from this view and submit that the interests of women and children are properly considered under s. 1 following Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, 2013 SCC 72, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1101, and Carter v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 5, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 331.

[69]                          LEAF invokes Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., 1994 CanLII 39 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835, and R. v. Mills, 1999 CanLII 637 (SCC), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 668, in which this Court balanced competing Charter rights under the breach analysis. These cases involved situations where state action directly implicated multiple sets of Charter rights. In both, the procedural rights of the accused brought the Charter rights of another party into conflict and created the risk that both sets of rights would be undermined.

[70]                          In my view, the Dagenais and Mills mode of analysis does not apply and does not support the argument that balancing between the rights and interests of alleged perpetrators and victims of crime should take place under s. 7 in this circumstance. Dagenais and Mills apply when the Charter rights of two or more parties are in conflict and both are directly implicated by state action, which is not the case here. Section 33.1 affects the substantive rights of the accused subject to prosecution by the state. The equality and dignity interests of women and children are certainly engaged as potential victims of crime — but in this context, by virtue of the accused’s actions, not of some state action against them. This is qualitatively different from the balancing undertaken for example in Mills, where it was state action — through the application of an evidentiary rule for the production of records to the accused relating to the complainant — that directly affected both the accused and the complainant. Section 33.1 operates to constrain the ability of an accused to rely on the defence of automatism but nothing in the provision limits, by the state’s action, the rights of victims including the ss. 7, 15 and 28 Charter rights of women and children. These interests are appropriately understood as justification for the infringement by the state. As the preamble of Bill C‑72 makes plain, the equality, dignity and security interests of vulnerable groups informed the overarching social policy goals of Parliament; they are best considered under s. 1.

[71]                          Considering these as societal concerns under s. 1 does not “relegate” the equality, security and dignity interests of women and children to second order importance. LEAF is correct to say that these rights are intensely important and must be given full consideration in the Charter analysis. Indeed, it has been usefully argued that the opportunity to consider the competing interests of vulnerable groups in the present context should find its fullest expression when a court considers the proportionality of deleterious and salutary effects of legislation under s. 1. Commenting on the justification for the breach by the majority of the Court of Appeal in Sullivan, Professor S. Coughlan writes that s. 1, as opposed to s. 7, gives a proper opportunity to “shift from an individual focus to a comparative focus”, which is methodologically more suited to balancing under s. 1 than s. 7 in this context (“Sullivan: Can a Section 7 Violation Ever be Saved Under Section 1?” (2020), 63 C.R. (7th) 157, at p. 159). Counsel for LEAF at the Sullivan and Chan appeals rightly urged that, as an alternative to her preferred s. 7 balancing, s. 1 should be seized upon by this Court to reinforce the accountability and protective objectives of s. 33.1 from the perspective of the particular vulnerability of women and children to the intoxicated violence (transcript, at p. 100). I agree.

[72]                          Finally, and with due respect for other views, the basic values against arbitrariness, overbreadth and gross disproportionality are unrelated to the analysis of the Charter rights engaged in this appeal and the Sullivan and Chan appeals. The principles in Bedford speak to “failures of instrumental rationality” that reflect a legislative provision that is unconnected from or grossly disproportionate with its purpose (para. 107). By contrast, the principles of fundamental justice in this case relate to substantive and procedural standards for criminal liability that ensure the fair operation of the legal system and which are “found in the basic tenets of our legal system” (Motor Vehicle Reference, at p. 503). I agree on this point with Paciocco J.A. in Sullivan (para. 61) that the challenge here pertains to s. 7 principles of the voluntariness and mens rea required to justify punishment and not those matters of arbitrariness and proportionality at issue in Bedford. A court’s s. 7 analysis should start by asking whether a statutory provision fails to meet the requirements of the specific principle raised by the claimant before turning to the more general matter as to whether the law is arbitrary or disproportionate in light of its purpose in the Bedford sense (R. v. Malmo-Levine, 2003 SCC 74, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 571, at paras. 129 and 135‑45).

(3)         Interpretation of Section 33.1

[73]                          Much of the argument in this appeal, as well as in the Sullivan and Chan appeals, turns on the proper interpretation of s. 33.1. Crown counsel and interveners in these appeals offer somewhat different readings of the text of s. 33.1 in support of its validity. In the Sullivan and Chan appeals, the Crown says that liability under s. 33.1 is imposed for the “predicate act of self-induced extreme intoxication when it leads to involuntary or unintended violence” (Appellant’s Condensed Book, at p. 1). That blameworthy predicate act is said to include, according to the Crown, a constitutionally-compliant fault element of negligence requiring a marked departure from the reasonably prudent person. In this appeal, it was argued that the “self‑induced” character of intoxication, alluded to in s. 33.1, incorporates voluntariness and mens rea components: “The act of voluntarily intoxicating oneself to an extreme level”, said the Crown, “is a marked departure from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society” (Respondent’s Condensed Book, at p. 1; see also transcript, at pp. 35‑36). When pressed on these interpretations of s. 33.1 in oral argument in this appeal and the Sullivan and Chan appeals, counsel acknowledged that the basis for the position they espouse was not found expressly in the text of the section. But, they said, when read purposefully and as a whole, s. 33.1 both eliminates a defence and creates a new mode of liability.

[74]                          The Attorney General of Canada stated that s. 33.1 must be read in keeping with the presumption of constitutionality. The Attorney General argued that the fault targeted by s. 33.1(1) and (2) is the voluntary consumption of an intoxicant that a person knew or ought to have known creates a risk of automatism and, when violence ensues, that self‑induced intoxication departs markedly from the standard of care reasonably expected in the circumstances. But in advancing that view, counsel acknowledged, at the hearing in the Sullivan and Chan appeals, that “you are not going to find that specifically in the section” (transcript, at p. 51). Moreover, counsel for the attorneys general of Canada, Manitoba and Saskatchewan invited the Court variously to interpret or read words into the text to overcome what was, they said, “inelegant drafting”, “hardly a model of successful drafting”, or a provision that was “oddly drafted” (Sullivan and Chan appeals, transcript, at pp. 56, 73 and 83).

[75]                          I see no ambiguity in s. 33.1 and disagree with the interpretation proposed by the Crown and the attorneys general which, with due respect for those who hold other views, falls afoul of the ordinary meaning of the provision. I would add that the interpretation proposed by the Crown in these appeals trenches on the plain reading of the text given by this Court in Bouchard-Lebrun, albeit in another context. This plain reading, as Paciocco and Khullar JJ.A. held, suggests strongly that Parliament fell short in its stated goal of providing a constitutionally‑compliant measure of criminal fault for violent crimes of general intent based on self‑induced intoxication.

[76]                          What does the impugned provision in fact say? Section 33.1(1) eliminates the defence of self‑induced intoxication akin to automatism applied to the violent offences identified in s. 33.1(3) where the accused departs markedly from the standard of care described in s. 33.1(2). It opens with the words “[i]t is not a defence”. These words have been consistently interpreted in the context of other provisions of the Criminal Code as invalidating or limiting a defence (R. v. George, 2017 SCC 38, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 1021, at para. 7; R. v. Levigne, 2010 SCC 25, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 3). Nowhere does s. 33.1 create a new offence, with or without the same penalties, be it a predicate act offence of self‑induced extreme intoxication or a new criminal negligence offence. The accused faces the full stigma of conviction and the full brunt of punishment for the general intent offence pointed to in s. 33.1(3). For Mr. Brown, that offence is the included offence of aggravated assault to count 1 of his indictment. For Mr. Sullivan, the offences are aggravated assault and assault with a weapon. For Mr. Chan, the offences are manslaughter and aggravated assault. In none of their cases were they charged with dangerous or negligent self-induced extreme intoxication causing bodily harm. Extreme voluntary intoxication may well be an instance of what many Canadians see as morally reprehensible conduct, but s. 33.1 — or any other act of Parliament for that matter — does not designate it an unlawful act.

[77]                          I agree with LeBel J. in Bouchard-Lebrun when he said that s. 33.1 applies when three conditions are met: (1) that the accused was intoxicated at the material time; (2) the intoxication was self‑induced; and (3) that the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society by interfering or threatening to interfere with the bodily integrity of another person (para. 89). LeBel J. did not comment on the constitutionality of the provision but observed how it operated, concluding — in a manner consonant with the ordinary meaning of the text itself — that when these three things are proved, it is not a defence that the accused lacked the general intent or the voluntariness required to commit the offence named in s. 33.1(3). To that extent, the provision undoes the defence recognized in Daviault.

[78]                          The Crown is mistaken when it draws an analogy between impaired driving offences and s. 33.1. The gravamen of the offence faced by Mr. Brown does not include intoxication, unlike criminal offences for impaired driving. Counsel for Mr. Sullivan made the point plainly: “The gravamen of assault is not intoxication. Without intoxication, every element of an assault [must] be proven; without intoxication, driving is benign” (Sullivan and Chan appeals, R.F., at para. 44; see also Sullivan, at para. 65, per Paciocco J.A.).

[79]                          The requirements of s. 33.1 — that the accused be intoxicated at the material time and the intoxication be self‑induced — are not, together or separately, a measure of fault. They are, as Bouchard-Lebrun makes clear, conditions of liability as the use of the word “while” in s. 33.1(2) confirms.

[80]                          Section 33.1(1) blocks the defence of automatism to general intent offences where the automatism was the result of self‑induced intoxication and the accused departed markedly from the standard of care described in s. 33.1(2). Under s. 33.1(2), an accused departs markedly from the standard of care where:

. . . the person, while in a state of self-induced intoxication that renders the person unaware of, or incapable of consciously controlling, their behaviour, voluntarily or involuntarily interferes or threatens to interfere with the bodily integrity of another person.

[81]                          In 1995, the Minister of Justice said in the House that “[w]e are stating in Bill C‑72 conclusively that intoxicating yourself to the point at which you lose conscious control and harm others is a departure from the standard of care” (Hansard, vol. 133, No. 177, 1st Sess., 35th Parl., March 27, 1995, at p. 11039). This description fits the text of the section that was enacted. The marked departure alluded to in s. 33.1(1) depends on proof of the two facts alluded to by the Minister and spoken to in s. 33.1(2). First, that the person must be in a state of self‑induced intoxication that renders them unaware of, or incapable of controlling, their behaviour. Second, the violent act must occur while they are in that state. These facts are best understood as conditions of liability and not measures of fault because neither of them import a criminal negligence standard.

[82]                          I disagree with the view advanced by the Attorney General of Saskatchewan and others that the adjective “self-induced” must be read so that s. 33.1 carries with it a proper criminal negligence standard. The cases say that intoxication is “self‑induced” where the accused voluntarily ingests a substance that they know or ought to know is an intoxicant, in circumstances where the risk of becoming intoxicated is or should be within their contemplation (see, e.g., R. v. Chaulk, 2007 NSCA 84, 257 N.S.R. (2d) 99 (“Chaulk (2007)”), at para. 47). The term “self‑induced intoxication” says nothing about whether the accused foresaw, or ought to have foreseen, the risk of extreme intoxication.

[83]                          Moreover, no plausible reading of the text suggests that self‑induced intoxication brings with it a reasonable foreseeability of bodily harm, as the voir dire judge rightly wrote in this case, at paras. 36‑37. In addition, I agree with Paciocco J.A. in Sullivan that the problem is not overcome by designating the violent act as the marked departure. This is so because, as he wrote, “moral fault cannot come from a consequence alone” (para. 94). Drawing on this Court’s judgment in Creighton, at p. 58, he explained that the mental fault inherent in penal negligence “lies in [the] failure to direct the mind to a risk which the reasonable person would have appreciated” (para. 94). If the marked departure from the norm was simply the violent act, the law countenances a form of absolute liability. On its face, and notwithstanding the reference to “departed markedly” in subs. (1), s. 33.1 is not a fault‑creating provision but one that sets conditions of liability for intoxicated violence. The fault is that which is already required in the underlying offence mentioned in s. 33.1(3).

[84]                          In oral argument in the Sullivan and Chan appeals, the Crown asserted that “nobody says that this is a pure deeming provision such that when this state of intoxication coincides with violence it results in liability” (transcript, at p. 5). This statement must be qualified. It is true that Mr. Brown, Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Chan do not suggest that s. 33.1 is a “pure” deeming provision, as they all recognize that s. 33.1 does not capture those who commit acts of automatistic violence after involuntarily consuming, say, a spiked drink. However, the Crown is incorrect in a more fundamental sense. As the appellant in this appeal and the respondents in the Sullivan and Chan appeals argue, s. 33.1 deems criminal fault for the violent offence to be present based on the accused’s choice to become intoxicated. Indeed, this was the conclusion reached by deWit J. (para. 30), and Khullar J.A. (para. 168) in this case, and by Paciocco and Lauwers JJ.A. in Sullivan (paras. 94 and 275). It is a conclusion, too, that finds repeated support in a segment of the scholarship on s. 33.1 (see, e.g., M. S. Lawrence, “Voluntary Intoxication and the Charter: Revisiting the Constitutionality of Section 33.1 of the Criminal Code” (2017), 40:3 Man. L.J. 391, at pp. 403‑10; S. Roy, “Intoxication”, in JurisClasseur Québec — Collection Droit pénal — Droit pénal général (loose‑leaf), fasc. 13, at No. 18). Crown counsel in the Sullivan and Chan appeals was well aware that, if the Court did not adopt his interpretation of s. 33.1 to include a fault on the marked departure standard as contemplated in Creighton and similar cases, “then the provision imposes liability in the absence of [a] necessary . . . minimum fault requirement and we are into section 1” (transcript, at p. 10).

[85]                          Contrary to the Crown’s position, the “marked departure” standard of fault in s. 33.1(2) clearly attaches then to the violent offence, not the act of self‑induced intoxication. Neither can the definition of “self-induced” supply the mens rea for criminal negligence, as it says nothing about risk, either by way of foreseeability of extreme intoxication or the possibility of violence.

[86]                          The whole of the text confirms this. Section 33.1(1) distinguishes self‑induced intoxication from the prohibited offence, meaning the two cannot be the same. It provides that no defence is available where “the accused, by reason of self‑induced intoxication, lacked the general intent or the voluntariness required to commit the offence”. This is telling and clearly indicates that what Parliament sought was to impose liability for the charged offence, namely the assaultive behaviour, and not the act of self‑induced intoxication itself. Furthermore, in R. v. Morrison, 2019 SCC 15, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 3, Moldaver J. interpreted the phrase “[i]t is not a defence” as precluding an independent pathway to conviction, as was similarly argued in that case (para. 82). Here, rather than an alternate route to liability, the word “defence” refers to a defence advanced by the accused that would entitle them to an acquittal.

[87]                          Counsel was unable to cite a single case in the 25‑year history of s. 33.1 that adopted the interpretation proposed here by the Crown apart from the majority view of the Court of Appeal in this case. Counsel further acknowledged that the court in R. v. Vickberg (1998), 1998 CanLII 15068 (BC SC), 16 C.R. (5th) 164 (B.C.S.C.) — cited by LeBel J. with approval in Bouchard-Lebrun, at para. 89 — expressly rejected the reading of s. 33.1 he advanced (Sullivan and Chan appeals, transcript, at pp. 30‑31). In my view, Vickberg rightly points to the failing of the Crown’s proposed interpretation and the reasoning offered in 1998 by Owen-Flood J. on this point remains compelling today: “The ‘marked departure’ language does not refer to the manner in which the accused got into the state of intoxication[, it refers to] the interference with another’s bodily integrity while in that state” (para. 69).

[88]                          Neither can this Court “read in” that interpretation, as the Crown suggested, by relying on the marginal notes accompanying the legislation and the presumption of constitutionality. To do so would strain the meaning beyond what the text can plausibly bear. In the Sullivan and Chan appeals, Crown counsel pointed this Court to the marginal note in Bill C‑72 recorded next to s. 33.1(2) in support of its interpretation (transcript, at p. 7). The marginal note may well state “Criminal fault by reason of intoxication” but, however relevant it is in interpreting parliamentary intent, it cannot displace the plain language of s. 33.1. Whatever the marginal note might suggest, the text states that fault is determined not “by reason” of intoxication but instead “while” in a state of intoxication. The Crown’s reliance on the presumption of constitutionality is also undermined by the plain meaning of the section. The presumption cannot be relied upon in service of one interpretation where statutory language to the contrary is so clear (Ontario v. Canadian Pacific Ltd., 1995 CanLII 112 (SCC), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1031, at para. 15).

(4)         Breaches of Sections 7 and 11(d) of the Charter

[89]                          Section 33.1 thus applies whenever a person interferes with the bodily integrity of another while in a state of extreme intoxication akin to automatism, regardless of whether a loss of awareness or control or a risk of harm was foreseeable. This breaches ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter, even if one accepts Sopinka J.’s premise in Daviault that individuals who create the conditions for their loss of control may be in some way morally blameworthy.

(a)           Mens Rea as Required by Section 7

[90]                          It is a principle of fundamental justice that proof of penal negligence, in the form of a marked departure from the standard of a reasonable person, is minimally required for a criminal conviction, unless the specific nature of the crime demands subjective fault (Creighton, at pp. 61‑62; Vaillancourt, at pp. 653‑54; DeSousa, at p. 962). If the offence takes the form of a predicate act offence, objective foreseeability of harm can be constitutionally sufficient (DeSousa, at p. 962).

[91]                          Section 33.1 requires, for its proper application, an intention to become intoxicated. As noted, the term “self‑induced intoxication” has been interpreted to mean voluntarily ingesting a substance that one knows or ought to have known is an intoxicant, in circumstances where the risk of becoming intoxicated is or should be within contemplation (Chaulk (2007), at para. 47). Yet, as LeBel J. observed in his interpretation of s. 33.1 in Bouchard‑Lebrun, “no distinction based on the seriousness of the effects of self‑induced intoxication is drawn in this provision” (para. 91). In other words, it matters little that a person did not foresee their loss of awareness or control. Moreover, nothing is said about the licit or illicit nature of the intoxicant or its known properties. Intention to become intoxicated to any degree suffices.

[92]                          For this reason, while the provision applies to those who recklessly invite their loss of control, it also captures the sudden and unexpected onset of involuntariness produced by “self-induced intoxication”, for example the patient who experiences an overwhelming and unexpected reaction to a prescribed pain medication and injures another in a state of involuntariness. The patient may have intended to experience the ordinary pain relief effects of the medication, but in those circumstances it would be beyond the contemplation of a reasonable person to foresee a loss of control or awareness of their behaviour.

[93]                          Section 33.1 also imposes criminal liability where a person’s intoxication carries no objective foreseeability of harm. Just as it draws no distinction based on the seriousness of the effects of intoxication, neither does s. 33.1 draw any distinction based on the risk of harm, which may vary depending on the intoxicant in question. It is certainly true that some inherently risky forms of self‑intoxication — such as mixing alcohol with dangerous street drugs — may carry reasonably foreseeable harm. The difficulty is that s. 33.1 applies even where the intoxicant in question is typically known for its relaxing or therapeutic properties: [translation] “. . . the provision seems capable of applying to people who have done little or nothing for which they can be reproached” (H. Parent, “La constitutionnalité de l’article 33.1 du Code criminel: analyse et commentaires” (2022), 26 Can. Crim. L. Rev. 175, at p. 190). Forms of self‑intoxication that carry reasonably foreseeable harm are more blameworthy than those that do not because the individual has proceeded in spite of the known risks. Yet s. 33.1 captures both indifferently on the premise that all extreme self-intoxication is blameworthy.

[94]                          Additionally, even where an offence criminalizes an inherently dangerous activity, the trier of fact must not simply infer a marked departure from the standard of care (see, e.g., R. v. Beatty, 2008 SCC 5, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49; Roy). It must still be asked whether, first, a reasonable person would have foreseen the risk and taken steps to avoid it and, second, whether the failure to do so amounted to a marked departure from the standard of care expected of a reasonable person in the circumstances. As Professor Parent has observed, [translation] “the danger of convicting a person who does not evince ‘sufficient blameworthiness to support a finding of penal liability’ is indeed real” (p. 191, quoting Beatty, at para. 33).

[95]                          Instead, s. 33.1 deems a person to have departed markedly from the standard of care expected in Canadian society whenever a violent act occurs while the person is in a state of extreme voluntary intoxication akin to automatism. This is so even where a loss of control or awareness of one’s behaviour and a risk of harm was unforeseeable and even where the accused’s conduct did not in fact depart markedly from the standard of a reasonable person. In doing so, s. 33.1 runs afoul of the principle of fundamental justice that penal liability requires proof of fault reflecting the offence and punishment faced by the accused (Motor Vehicle Reference, at pp. 513‑15; Vaillancourt, at pp. 653‑54). Since s. 33.1 allows a court to convict an accused without proof of the constitutionally required mens rea, s. 33.1 violates s. 7 (Daviault, at p. 90). By allowing courts to convict individuals of a crime without proof of mens rea, s. 33.1 turns those offences, which carry the possibility of imprisonment, into what amounts to absolute liability offences, contrary to s. 7 of the Charter (Motor Vehicle Reference, at p. 515).

(b)         Voluntariness as Required by Section 7

[96]                          Section 33.1 also directs that an accused person is criminally responsible for their involuntary conduct. Because involuntariness negates the actus reus of the offence, involuntary conduct is not criminal, and Canadian law recognizes that the requirement of voluntariness for the conviction of a crime is a principle of fundamental justice (Luedecke, at para. 53; Daviault, at pp. 91‑92). Mr. Brown was convicted by the Court of Appeal of aggravated assault, for actions that he did not commit voluntarily. This breaches s. 7.

[97]                          There may be situations in which an accused should be answerable for their involuntary actions where they are to blame for the conditions that led to their involuntariness. In terms of physical involuntariness, Professors Plaxton and Mathen give the example of an accused experiencing an involuntary reflex and pulling the trigger of a gun deliberately and voluntarily pointed at a victim (p. 264). I disagree, however, with the view of Slatter J.A. that s. 33.1 operates in a similar manner when he wrote that “Parliament is entitled to establish criminal liability commencing at the stage that intoxicating substances are voluntarily consumed, where the risk of harm to other persons is self‑created and objectively foreseeable” (para. 25, citing Penno, at pp. 884‑85 and 904). The gravamen of s. 33.1 is the violent conduct for which an accused person is charged — in the case of Mr. Brown, aggravated assault — and not the act of voluntarily consuming intoxicants.

[98]                          It may be that the voluntariness problem could be avoided if Parliament legislated an offence of dangerous intoxication or intoxication causing harm that incorporates voluntary intoxication as an essential element — in this hypothetical offence, the gravamen of the offence is the voluntary intoxication, not the involuntary conduct that follows. I recall that, in part, this was the invitation made by the majority of this Court in Daviault (p. 100); a suggested avenue of legislative action that had also been noted nearly twenty years before the enactment of Bill C‑72 by Dickson J., as he then was, in Leary (“a crime of being drunk and dangerous”) (pp. 46‑47). I recall too that Paciocco J.A. signaled this option in Sullivan, as one that would not infringe the Charter rights that s. 33.1 disregards: “It would criminalize”, he wrote, “the very act from which the Crown purports to derive the relevant moral fault, namely, the decision to become intoxicated in those cases where that intoxication proves, by the subsequent conduct of the accused, to have been dangerous” (para. 134). This, however, is not what Parliament enacted in that s. 33.1 exposes the accused to jeopardy for the underlying offence, not for extreme intoxication which is not, in itself, an unlawful act.

(c)           Substitution as Prohibited by Section 11(d)

[99]                          Section 11(d) of the Charter guarantees the accused’s right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. To convict the accused, the Crown must prove all the essential elements, including the requisite mens rea for the offence, beyond a reasonable doubt. As my colleague Moldaver J. explained in Morrison, Parliament sometimes directs that proof of one fact is presumed to satisfy proof of one of the essential elements of the offence and this kind of substitution can comply with s. 11(d). Yet as he observed, the presumption of innocence will only be satisfied if proof of the substituted fact leads “inexorably” to the conclusion that the essential element it replaces exists (para. 52). This connection must hold true “in all cases” and not be based on a mere probability or common sense inference (para. 53). Otherwise, the substitution may result in the accused being convicted, based on proof of the substituted fact, despite the existence of a reasonable doubt as to the essential element of the offence that it replaces.

[100]                     Many critics of Daviault take the view that intoxication should aggravate, not excuse, the liability of someone who self‑intoxicates and causes injury to another, even if their actions are involuntary (see discussion in P. Healy, “Criminal Reports Forum on Daviault: Extreme Intoxication Akin to Automatism Defence to Sexual Assault — Another Round on Intoxication” (1995), 33 C.R. (4th) 269, at p. 271). It is often argued that the fault attaching to a person who puts themselves in a situation where they lose control and cause harm to another by reason of voluntary intoxication sufficiently demonstrates fault for the violent act itself. I recall the words of the Minister in Parliament quoted above who, after referencing the dissent in Daviault, noted that the blameworthiness in the act of voluntary intoxication can be sufficient to link it to criminal liability for the harm charged in the offence given the seriousness of that harm.

[101]                     The Crown argues that s. 33.1 is not an instance of improper substitution, but instead a choice by Parliament to redefine the fault and voluntariness required for conviction of the underlying offence. Where violence ensues, the expression “self‑induced intoxication” in s. 33.1 includes a voluntariness component in that the accused is properly held responsible for the free choice to become extremely intoxicated. The term “self-induced” also provides the constitutionally required mens rea. It should be interpreted, says the Crown, to mean that the accused knew or ought to have known that the substance was an intoxicant and that the risk of becoming intoxicated was or should have been in their contemplation. Moreover, read together, s. 33.1(1) and (2) satisfy the requirements of criminal negligence of a marked departure from the standard of reasonable conduct through the voluntary act of becoming intoxicated.

[102]                     I disagree with the Crown. Mr. Brown is right to say that s. 33.1 improperly substitutes proof of self‑induced intoxication for proof of the essential elements of an offence, contrary to s. 11(d) of the Charter.

[103]                     As noted, s. 33.1 unequivocally removes a defence that the accused lacked the general intent or voluntariness to commit the offence. Accordingly, the fault and voluntariness of intoxication are substituted by s. 33.1 for the fault and voluntariness of the violent offence. The provision has been described as “a legislated form of guilt‑by‑proxy” whereby the moral blameworthiness that one might associate with extreme self‑induced intoxication is substituted for the mens rea of the violent offences of general intent which make up the charge pursuant to s. 33.1(3) (Lawrence, at p. 391; see also F. E. Chapman, “Sullivan. Specific and General Intent be Damned: Volition Missing and Mens Rea Incomplete” (2020), 63 C.R. (7th) 164, at pp. 167‑71). To avoid the improper substitution problem, the trier of fact must be sure that the fault attaching to the intoxication is such that the person can fairly be held accountable for their violent conduct.

[104]                     Section 33.1 fails the test in Morrison and amounts to a constitutionally improper substitution. While an accused who loses conscious control and assaults another person after a night of substance abuse is undoubtedly morally blameworthy, s. 33.1 faces obvious difficulties. It does not discern, for example, between the accused and morally blameless individuals who voluntarily consume legal intoxicants for personal or medical purposes. It therefore cannot be said that, “in all cases” under s. 33.1, the intention to become intoxicated can be substituted for the intention to commit a violent offence. Moreover, even in the case of the accused who voluntarily ingested an illegal drug like magic mushrooms, proof of self-induced intoxication does not lead inexorably to the conclusion that the accused intended to or voluntarily committed aggravated assault in all cases.

[105]                     In sum, the effect of s. 33.1 is to invite conviction even where a reasonable doubt remains about the voluntariness or the fault required to prove the violent offence, contrary to the presumption of innocence under s. 11(d).

(d)         Contemporaneity

[106]                     As a final point, Mr. Brown asserts that s. 33.1 infringes s. 7 of the Charter because the violent offence occurs later in time than the intention to become intoxicated. Mr. Brown says this is contrary to rule of contemporaneity, which holds that the actus reus and mens rea must coincide. The Crown responds that symmetry is not required between the mens rea and the consequences of the prohibited act.

[107]                     Symmetry differs from contemporaneity. Symmetry refers to knowledge or foreseeability of the precise consequences of the actus reus. For example, in Creighton, McLachlin J., as she then was, held that the accused need not foresee death, the consequence, specifically — it was enough to foresee bodily harm that is neither trivial nor transitory (pp. 44‑45). Contemporaneity holds that the guilty mind must concur with the prohibited act, although this principle is applied flexibly (R. v. Cooper, 1993 CanLII 147 (SCC), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 146, at p. 156). Contemporaneity has not yet been recognized as a principle of fundamental justice, and I respectfully decline to do so here. The mens rea, voluntariness, and improper substitution breaches remain the most accurate and relevant way of describing the way in which s. 33.1 imposes absolute liability, contrary to the principles of fundamental justice.

[108]                     I thus agree with the conclusion of the voir dire judge and with Khullar J.A., who relied on the reasons of the majority of the Court of Appeal in Sullivan, that s. 33.1 violates ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter.

[109]                     I turn to a consideration of whether s. 33.1 can be saved under s. 1.

C.            Justification Analysis

[110]                     The Crown must show on a balance of probabilities that the limits on ss. 7 and 11(d) brought by s. 33.1 are reasonable and demonstrably justified under s. 1 of the Charter (Oakes, at pp. 135 and 137). The legislative goals of the provision must first be sufficiently pressing and substantial to justify curtailing a Charter right. There must also be proportionality between Parliament’s objectives and its chosen means. Proportionality is understood to have three components: (i) rational connection to the objective, (ii) minimal impairment of the right, and (iii) proportionality between the effects of the measure and the objective (Oakes, at pp. 138‑39; R. v. K.R.J., 2016 SCC 31, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 906, at para. 58).

[111]                     Unlike in the appeal in Daviault, Parliament had before it a record related to the social problems associated with extreme intoxication and violence when enacting s. 33.1. The evidence highlighted the strong correlation between alcohol and drug use and violent offences, in particular against women, and brought to the fore of Parliament’s attention the equality, dignity, and security rights of all victims of intoxicated violence with particular attention given to vulnerable groups, including women and children. In the circumstances of the three appeals before the Court, it is undeniable that Mr. Brown, Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Chan inflicted great harm upon their victims and have caused lasting physical and psychological injuries. Bill C‑72’s protective public goals cannot be understated: these interests bear meaningful attention at both principal steps in the s. 1 analysis.

[112]                     While s. 33.1 reflects broad Parliamentary pursuits relating to the common good, it also engages the traditional confrontation between the individual accused and the state in the context of a criminal prosecution. As we have seen, s. 33.1 challenges principles at the very core of our justice system, including the presumption of innocence, that exist to protect the morally innocent and prevent wrongful convictions. I observe that Parliament also had these considerations in mind in enacting s. 33.1. The sixth paragraph of the preamble has largely been ignored, where Parliament states its desire “to promote and help to ensure the full protection of the rights guaranteed under sections 7, 11, 15 and 28 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms for all Canadians”. To be sure, this contains a further reference to the rights of victims, including women and children. But the reference to s. 7 also extends, of course, to persons accused and, more tellingly still, the reference to s. 11, including the presumption of innocence in s. 11(d), can only refer to “[a]ny person charged with an offence”. In announcing its policy goals of protecting victims of intoxicated violence, on the one hand, and the rights of the accused, on the other, Parliament appears to have foreseen in the preamble the delicate balancing task that this Court must undertake under s. 1 of the Charter.

[113]                     Invoking the goals served by s. 33.1, the Crown submits that the Alberta Court of Appeal was right to decide the provision imposes reasonable limits and is justified under s. 1. As for Mr. Brown, he argues that the provision fails at each step of the proportionality analysis. Its only valid purpose is not rationally connected to the provision, it is not minimally impairing, and the meaningful risk of wrongful convictions outweigh the salutary effects.

[114]                     In my respectful view, Mr. Brown significantly understates the important goals pursued by Parliament in enacting s. 33.1. That said, given the patent risk that s. 33.1 may result in the conviction of an accused person who had no reason to believe that their voluntary intoxication would lead to a violent consequence, I agree with him, and with the respondents in the Sullivan and Chan appeals, that s. 33.1 fails at the proportionality step and thus cannot be saved under s. 1. After a weighing of the salutary and deleterious effects of s. 33.1, including the risk of what I see as a wrongful conviction, I conclude that Parliament’s aims come at too high a cost.

(1)         Pressing and Substantial Purpose

[115]                     The parliamentary record, the preamble and, of course, s. 33.1 itself, all point to the two broad reasons why s. 33.1 was enacted in the period following Daviault: the protection of the victims of extremely intoxicated violence and a sense that the law should hold offenders accountable for the bodily harm they cause to others when, by choice, they become extremely intoxicated. With some variations, these were the purposes recognized by the voir dire judge and all the judges on appeal in this case.

[116]                     While these broad aspirations are easy enough to identify, the accused in this appeal and in the Sullivan and Chan appeals argue that the purposes of a provision must be described with greater precision when one examines whether a law that breaches the Charter is justified under s. 1. It is rightly said that, for the law’s purpose to be “pressing and substantial”, it must be characterized in light of the requirements of the Oakes test to be of value (Frank v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 SCC 1, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 3, at para. 46; Alberta v. Hutterian Brethren of Wilson Colony, 2009 SCC 37, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 567, at para. 76). The purpose must be properly identified with a view to justifying the infringement of the Charter, otherwise the exercise is not helpful for the balancing mandated by s. 1. If the purpose is characterized too broadly and without a view to the infringement, the rational connection inquiry in Oakes and the balancing exercise at the core of the s. 1 analysis risk losing their raison d’être. One can fairly say that virtually all of substantive criminal law seeks, at some level, to “protect victims of crime” and “hold perpetrators accountable for their blameworthy conduct”. So characterized, s. 33.1 would inevitably be understood as rationally connected to its purpose and the measure of proportionality would be thwarted such that the s. 1 analysis would lose its explanatory value.

[117]                     It is not therefore enough to say, as the Attorney General of Canada does here, that “protection for victims of intoxicated crime” and “holding perpetrators of intoxicated violence accountable” defines Parliament’s purpose in enacting s. 33.1 in such a sufficiently precise a manner so as to ground the s. 1 analysis (I.F., at paras. 3 and 6). In particular, this was one of the reasons that Paciocco J.A. rejected accountability as a pressing and substantial purpose in Sullivan. Not only is “accountability for morally blameworthy” conduct unhelpfully broad, “accountability for morally blameworthy behaviour in a constitutionally compliant manner” is also unworkable in that the latter identification of the accountability purpose risks circular reasoning by confusing the ends of the legislation with its means. Nor is it enough to say that Parliament simply sought to legislate a standard of fault, as that would describe the purpose too narrowly and merely reiterate the means chosen to achieve the legislative ends (K.R.J., at para. 63).

[118]                     What, then, are the objectives of s. 33.1 and are they properly identified for conducting the justification exercise under s. 1?

[119]                     It is plain that s. 33.1, above all things, blocks the defence of automatism for the extremely intoxicated offender that was recognized in Daviault as an exception to the intoxication rules. Parliament did so with two specific purposes in mind. First, it sought to protect the victims of extremely intoxicated violence, with particular attention to women and children whose equal place in society is compromised by sexual assault and other violent crimes of general intent in such circumstances. Second, it sought to call offenders to answer for their choice to voluntarily ingest intoxicants, where that choice creates a risk of violent crime. Those offenders should be accountable for the harm they cause as a result of their choice to self‑intoxicate and thereby create the risk of extreme intoxication. In other words, in addition to its goal of protecting victims of such crimes, Parliament wanted to explain, as a moral proposition, why the defence of automatism should not be available for those who chose to intoxicate themselves to an extreme degree and risk violent consequences. Unlike a person who becomes an automaton by reason of an external force beyond their control, a person who voluntarily becomes intoxicated in the extreme has taken a risk that they will harm others in that state. Parliament sought to have an accused answer for that choice. These are the two objectives that Parliament felt were sufficient to justify the enactment of legislation that, as we have seen, infringes prima facie upon ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter.

[120]                     I share the view that the protective purpose is sufficiently pressing and substantial to warrant limiting Charter rights. As stated by Lamer C.J. in R. v. Robinson, 1996 CanLII 233 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 683, at para. 43: “There is no question that the protection of the public from intoxicated offenders is of sufficient importance to warrant overriding a constitutionally protected right or freedom.”

[121]                     Paciocco J.A. explained in Sullivan why he viewed the accountability objective as impermissible and, as a result, cannot be considered as a “pressing and substantial objective” under the Oakes analysis. He wrote in part: “It cannot be that a preference for other values over constitutionally entrenched values is a pressing and substantial reason for denying constitutional rights” (para. 113).

[122]                     Respectfully, I disagree. First, as I note below, Parliament did not “reject” the constitutional values spoken to in Daviault when it enacted s. 33.1. As the Minister stated in the House and as evidenced by the preamble to Bill C‑72, the law sought to respect both the rights of the accused and the interests of victims. More importantly, I believe that, properly construed, Parliament’s specific accountability objective in the particular circumstances of this case is neither too broad nor does it lead to circular reasoning that would defeat the usefulness of Oakes.

[123]                     The objectives that moved Parliament to enact s. 33.1 in the wake of Daviault are not completely encapsulated by the single goal of protecting the victims of extremely intoxicated violent crime. For Parliament, s. 33.1 also sought to express a moral view, stated in the preamble, that a person should be precluded from escaping liability for certain violent crimes by reason of their self‑induced extreme intoxication. In the House, the Minister made plain when speaking to his approach based on the principle of accountability, that “[p]eople cannot be permitted to hide behind drunkenness or other forms of intoxication to escape responsibility for their criminal conduct” (Hansard, March 27, 1995, at p. 11038). Parliament’s purpose in enacting s. 33.1 reflects this idea of personal responsibility and its relevance to the availability of the defence of automatism for intoxicated violence.

[124]                     The objective that Parliament sought to act upon is distinct from the protective purpose of the law. In fact, it rests on a philosophical idea that one should not be able to create the conditions of one’s own criminal defence to block liability for the crime committed (see S. Dimock, “Actio Libera in Causa” (2013), 7 Crim. Law and Philos. 549, at p. 511 (who gives the example of the voluntarily intoxicated offender); see also, Plaxton and Mathen, at p. 257). As Professor Parent has written, in addition to protecting the public, [translation] “the purpose of section 33.1 is to render accountable those intoxicated individuals who interfere with the bodily integrity of another person” based on what he describes as the “active participation of the individual in creating the incapacity relied upon and the risk that materialized” (pp. 176 and 184 (emphasis in original)). This is the essence of the accountability objective: an individual is responsible for their involuntary state because that person’s choice to ingest intoxicants and become extremely intoxicated ultimately creates a risk of violence. The physically involuntary conduct did not arise by accident or through some external force, but by choice and, as such, Parliament saw this as conduct for which the offender must answer. The connection observed in the Parliamentary record between violence and intoxication would be attenuated, on this moral view, if people took responsibility for the choice they made to consume intoxicants and the risks that are created by that choice. Because of the danger they create through the voluntary character of their extreme intoxication, people who cause harm to others in that state are, to recall Sopinka J.’s phrase in dissent in Daviault, “far from blameless”. In answer to the public response to Daviault, s. 33.1 has the distinct public purpose of holding the voluntarily extremely intoxicated responsible for the danger they brought about.

[125]                     Perhaps the plainest demonstration that Parliament’s objective cannot be limited to the protective goal is found in the explanation, by the Minister, as to why the stand‑alone offence was rejected as not meeting his goals. He accepted the view that the option of a new stand-alone offence of criminal intoxication would be inadequate. While it offers protection against extremely intoxicated violence, it fails to meet Parliament’s accountability objective in that the offender would not be held to answer for creating the risk of more serious underlying violent crime, with its more meaningful stigma and punishment. Even if found guilty of the new offence, the offender would not answer, by reason of their self-induced extreme intoxication, for the full extent of the harm in law, and would benefit from what the Minister described as a “drunkenness discount” (Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, April 6, 1995, at p. 6). He observed that “[t]he government believes that a person who becomes voluntarily intoxicated to the point of losing conscious control or awareness . . . should be held criminally accountable for that offence [i.e., the underlying assault] and for nothing less”, said the Minister in the House (Hansard, March 27, 1995, at pp. 11037‑38).

[126]                     This distinct and particularized accountability goal can serve as an objective for the purpose of the Oakes test in the unusual circumstances of this case. Here, the objective concerns the choice to create a risk, and this choice is not the conduct Parliament aims to criminalize. In other words, the objective is separate from the gravamen of the offence (i.e., the assault), which ensures that the ends and the means remain distinct. Stated in this manner, accountability in this context is pressing and substantial and fits appropriately within the Oakes analysis. This is not just a preference for other values over rights that have been constitutionally entrenched; right or wrong, it is a policy choice, by Parliament, that accountability for creating a risk of violence and bodily harm by way of extreme voluntary intoxication take precedence in a free and democratic society (see Coughlan, at p. 2). It is not circular to frame the accountability objective in this way; the finding that a right has been violated, as I have found here with respect to ss. 7 and 11(d), is a preliminary conclusion. An “infringement” in this context is a limit that is not justified (K.R.J., at paras. 91‑92 and 115‑16). The infringement question is only answered once the prima facie breaches have been considered in light of the broader public interest considerations mandated by Oakes.

[127]                     To be clear, this conclusion rests on the specific concerns Parliament had when enacting s. 33.1. This case engages unusual issues and should not be seen as allowing governments to justify attempts to expand criminal liability as a routine matter. The accountability objective must, as here, be defined with precision, distinct from the means and, importantly, be sufficiently compelling from a societal perspective to warrant the overriding of rights.

(2)         Proportionality

(a)           Rational Connection

[128]                     At this stage, the Crown must show, first, that s. 33.1 is rationally connected to holding individuals accountable, in as full a manner as possible, for the choice to become extremely intoxicated and the violence committed while in that state and, second, that it is rationally connected to protecting vulnerable groups from extremely intoxicated violence. There must be “a causal connection between the infringement and the benefit sought on the basis of reason or logic” (RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 1995 CanLII 64 (SCC), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 199, at para. 153).

[129]                     Mr. Brown focussed his criticism on the connection between s. 33.1 and the protection of vulnerable groups, as did Mr. Chan and Mr. Sullivan. In Mr. Brown’s submission, the protective purpose relies on an unrealizable deterrent effect of s. 33.1 for its value. Since a person cannot necessarily foresee the possibility that they will find themselves in a state of automatism or that they will commit an act of violence while in that state, s. 33.1 can have no meaningful deterrent effect. In short, deterrence has no effect on the automaton.

[130]                     I agree with the Court of Appeal in this case that the deterrent and denunciating effects of s. 33.1 provide a rational connection to Parliament’s protective objective.

[131]                     I recognize Paciocco J.A.’s criticism that s. 33.1 fails to offer meaningful deterrence in support of Parliament’s protective purpose. In Sullivan, he wrote that “[e]ffective deterrence requires foresight . . . of the penal consequence” (para. 121). “I am not persuaded”, he continued, “that a reasonable person would anticipate the risk that, by becoming voluntarily intoxicated, they could lapse into a state of automatism and unwilfully commit a violent act” (ibid.).

[132]                     It is no doubt true that the deterrent effect of the provision would be more immediately felt if one could be sure that the accused understood the risk of violence associated with extreme self-induced intoxication and that this element is lacking in s. 33.1. However, in keeping with its moral view of fault expressed in the preamble, Parliament’s focus was on the choice to become extremely intoxicated. Section 33.1’s deterrent value should also be considered in relation to individuals at the time they make that choice. While it is true that s. 33.1 applies to an accused who could not have foreseen the risk of a loss of control or of bodily harm, it also extends to situations in which there was a foreseeable risk of a loss of control and harm. Thus, an individual who consumes an intoxicant with psychosis‑inducing effects, including those who know they lost control of their conduct while in a drug‑induced psychosis in the past, will be caught by s. 33.1. It is reasonable that Parliament would expect the provision to hold some modest deterrent effect for such individuals. This deterrent effect acts [translation] “upstream”, as Professor Parent writes (p. 187), to dissuade those contemplating this kind of intoxication. As such, s. 33.1 is rationally connected to its protective purpose.

[133]                     Courts should exercise caution before concluding that a measure in like circumstances is ineffective simply because they could imagine a way in which it would be more effective. To my mind, the Crown has met the rational connection test for Parliament’s protective purpose.

[134]                     In addition, s. 33.1 is rationally connected to the objective of holding individuals accountable, in as full a manner as possible, for the choice to become extremely intoxicated and the violence committed while in that state. It is obvious that where a person is foreclosed from advancing a defence that could result in an acquittal, that person is held accountable for something they otherwise would not be.

(b)         Minimal Impairment

[135]                     The state must show that the impugned provision impairs rights as little as reasonably possible in furtherance of the legislative objective (RJR-MacDonald, at para. 160; Oakes, at p. 139). The law should only fail minimal impairment when there are less harmful means of achieving the objectives “in a real and substantial manner” (K.R.J., at para. 70; Hutterian Brethren, at para. 55). It is understood that the courts show some deference to legislatures at this stage of the analysis. The question is whether s. 33.1 falls within a range of reasonable alternatives open to Parliament to achieve its objectives; if it is within this range, it should not fail the minimal impairment test merely because, in the Court’s view, an alternative would have been better suited to the objective (see RJR-MacDonald, at para. 160). This is particularly so where the impugned measure seeks to strike a balance between competing and legitimate social values (Quebec (Attorney General) v. A, 2013 SCC 5, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 61, at para. 439, per McLachlin C.J., concurring). This is the circumstance here: the debate surrounding the enactment of s. 33.1 and its application to Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Chan and Mr. Brown has brought to the fore the challenge Parliament faced in striking a balance between the rights of the accused and the stake society has in the equality and dignity interests of the victims of intoxicated violence.

[136]                     I have no hesitation imagining less impairing options. Many scholars have advanced options that would trench less on the rights of the accused (see, e.g., D. Stuart, “Parliament Should Declare a New Responsibility for Drunkenness Based on Criminal Negligence” (1995), 33 C.R. (4th) 289; T. Quigley, “A Time for Parliament to Enact an Offence of Dangerous Incapacitation” (1995), 33 C.R. (4th) 283; M. Tremblay, “Charte canadienne et intoxication volontaire: l’article 33.1 du Code criminel et ses solutions de rechange” (2020), 79 R. du B. 67, at p. 98; G. Ferguson, “The Intoxication Defence: Constitutionally Impaired and in Need of Rehabilitation” (2012), 57 S.C.L.R. (2d) 111). Paciocco J.A. concluded that a stand‑alone offence of criminal intoxication would achieve similar objectives as s. 33.1 and would arguably improve on the protective purpose by making deterrence more focused on the intoxication itself (paras. 132‑34). It is certainly true, as the Minister said in Parliament, that the lesser stigma and lesser penalties associated with a new offence would punish intoxicated perpetrators less severely for their wrongs than would a conviction for the underlying offence. But it is an alternative to the consequence of allowing the extremely intoxicated offender to escape punishment altogether.

[137]                     Apart from the stand‑alone offence, others have proposed alternative paths to liability for the underlying violent offence based on a criminal negligence standard more carefully crafted than that advanced by s. 33.1. One example is that proposed by the voir dire judge. He accepted Parliament’s goal of holding people accountable for a violent act when they have departed from a minimum standard of care by voluntarily consuming intoxicants (para. 79). However, he observed that this standard could be achieved in a less impairing way if s. 33.1 incorporated a true objective fault standard that clearly attaches to the act of self-induced intoxication, which would allow the trier of fact to consider whether a loss of control and bodily harm were both reasonably foreseeable at the time of intoxication (para. 80). He concluded that this would “truly be a link between the mens rea of becoming intoxicated and the mens rea for the underlying offence” (ibid.). This would align with the principle in DeSousa and Creighton that specific consequences need not always be foreseen provided there is an objectively foreseeable risk of bodily harm.

[138]                     In terms of the minimal impairment analysis, the stand-alone offence fails to meet Parliament’s full objective and thus was not a viable alternative. It would have labelled Mr. Brown’s offence as one of negligent or dangerous intoxication, rather than stigmatize him for the aggravated assault. The stand-alone offence might also have led to lesser sentences, and, as noted above, the option was criticized as proposing a “drunkenness discount”. Indeed, Parliament rejected the stand-alone offence because it would fail to recognize the true harm committed by an offender and would send the message that an offender should not be held accountable for the harm that is inherent in the underlying offence (see, e.g., Department of Justice, Self‑Induced Intoxication as Criminal Fault: Information Note (1995), at p. 5). This would be a particular failure in respect of Parliament’s goal to hold perpetrators to account in as full a manner as possible for the choice to become extremely intoxicated and the violence committed while in that state (see P. Healy, “Intoxication in the Codification of Canadian Criminal Law” (1994), 73 Can. Bar Rev. 515, at pp. 541‑42; E. Sheehy, “The intoxication defense in Canada: why women should care” (1996), 23 Contemp. Drug Probs. 595, at p. 618). In the circumstances, it is difficult to conclude that the stand-alone offence would have achieved the objectives in a “real and substantial manner”.

[139]                     The alternative proposed by the voir dire judge could however allow an accused to be convicted for the underlying violent act and not simply negligent or dangerous intoxication. Incorporating a true marked departure standard into s. 33.1 would allow it to achieve the minimum objective fault standard required by the Constitution (in the case of offences that are not constitutionally required to contain subjective fault, per R. v. Martineau, 1990 CanLII 80 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 633). Indeed, Khullar J.A. recognized that this alternative would be “less problematic”.

[140]                     I am aware that Parliament is entitled to deference in this analysis. Indeed, in crafting a new legislative response to the problem of intoxicated violence, it is up to Parliament to decide how to balance its objectives while also respecting Charter rights as much as possible (see, e.g., P. W. Hogg and A. A. Bushell, “The Charter Dialogue Between Courts and Legislatures” (1997), 35 Osgoode Hall L.J. 75; D. Baker and R. Knopff, “Daviault Dialogue: The Strange Journey of Canada’s Intoxication Defence” (2014), 19 Rev. Const. Stud. 35, at p. 41). Parliament may also wish to study and regulate according to the nature and properties of the intoxicant. The common effects of the intoxicant, its legality, and the circumstances in which it was obtained and consumed may be relevant to a marked departure standard.

[141]                     In light of these alternatives, in particular that proposed by the voir dire judge, which would have achieved Parliament’s accountability objective in a real and substantial manner, I conclude that s. 33.1 is not minimally impairing. Parliament’s objectives of protection and accountability would have been partially met by the stand‑alone offence and even more completely met had Parliament properly followed through on its announced design for a law based on a constitutionally‑compliant standard of criminal negligence. But I acknowledge that this is a close call and that experts who have studied the alternatives are not of a single view. Professor Parent has, for example, proposed no less than four variations on the criminal negligence theme, all designed to ensure that the objective fault required by a remodeled s. 33.1 would ensure that punishment for the general intent offence would only be imposed on those deserving the stigma of a criminal conviction (p. 191).

[142]                     While I conclude that s. 33.1 is not minimally impairing of an accused’s ss. 7 and 11(d) rights, I recognize that Parliament is entitled to a degree of deference in measuring the reasonable character of policy alternatives. But even if those who defend the law as minimally impairing were right, I am unequivocally of the view that s. 33.1 must fail on the last branch of the proportionality test which reveals the most profound failings of the provision. Mindful that the proportionality analysis is holistic and depends on a close connection between the final two stages of Oakes (Hutterian Brethren, at para. 191, per LeBel J.), I turn now to an explanation of why s. 33.1 must also fail on an assessment of the relative benefits and negative effects of the law under the Oakes test.

(c)           Proportionality Between Effects and Objectives

[143]                     At the final stage under s. 1, the question is whether there is proportionality between the overall effects of the Charter-infringing measure and the legislative objectives (Oakes, at p. 139; Hutterian Brethren, at paras. 72‑73). This invites the broadest assessment of the benefits of s. 33.1 to society, weighed against the cost of the limitations to ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter (see K.R.J., at para. 77; Bedford, at para. 123; Carter, at para. 122). Balancing requires a court to “transcend the law’s purpose and engage in a robust examination of the law’s impact on Canada’s free and democratic society ‘in direct and explicit terms’” (K.R.J., at para. 79).

[144]                     Mr. Brown says that the Court of Appeal erred in minimizing the deleterious effects of s. 33.1 in that the provision would allow for wrongful convictions based on involuntary acts and the absence of even reasonable foreseeability of the consequences of those acts. In response, the Crown asks this Court to accept the proportionality analysis of the Court of Appeal, in particular the analysis of Khullar J.A. It says that her emphasis on the gendered nature of intoxicated violence and Parliament’s efforts to address that problem in s. 33.1 should be adopted, notwithstanding the abridgment of the ss. 7 and 11(d) Charter rights of the accused which the Crown argues Mr. Brown has overstated.

[145]                     In my view, Mr. Brown is right on this point. In the result, the meaningful benefits of s. 33.1 do not outweigh the costs, in particular to what the voir dire judge describes as the “sacrosanct principles” integral to our criminal justice system, including the presumption of innocence (para. 89).

(i)            Salutary Effects

[146]                     By including general intent crimes of sexual and domestic violence within s. 33.1(3), the amendments to the Criminal Code do help to ensure the rights of women and children to equal protection and benefit of the law as guaranteed by the Charter, as promised in the preamble. The provision gives expression to the close and harmful association between extreme self-induced intoxication and violence. By removing the defence in s. 33.1(1), it ensures that the morally blameworthy conduct of self‑induced extreme intoxication is not an excuse at law for that violence, which is a plain social good. Section 33.1 voices society’s strong intolerance for such behaviour, and affirms society’s commitment to the equality and security rights of victims vulnerable to intoxicated crime.

[147]                     The “recognition of the dignity and self‑worth of women and children” was well described by Khullar J.A., who wrote that this “breathes some meaning” into equality rights in the Charter, and properly took notice of this as a beneficial effect of s. 33.1 in the justification analysis (para. 202). Others have rightly observed that violence against vulnerable groups is “one way in which women are denied full participation in society, furthering women’s inequality” (Grant, “Second Chances: Bill C‑72 and the Charter”, at p. 388). Section 33.1 responds meaningfully to that inequality by recognizing that women and children deserve the full protection of the law and by condemning intoxicated gendered and family violence. I would add that by considering equality as a broad social interest under s. 1 rather than under s. 7 as she did, Khullar J.A. did not devalue its importance as a justification for the Charter violation. Not only is s. 7 unsuited, in this case, to the balancing of competing rights, s. 1 is the proper locus for considering how much society, including the victims of crime, benefit from the impugned law (see Bedford, at para. 125; Coughlan, at p. 157). I agree too with Khullar J.A. that a benefit of s. 33.1 is that the accountability promised in the preamble advances dignity and equality interests that unpunished intoxicated violence threatens (paras. 202‑4).

[148]                     Section 33.1 also provides societal benefit through its communicative and deterrent effects. Khullar J.A. recognized not only that s. 33.1 contributes to a social ethos of disapproval of extreme self‑induced intoxication, she wrote that it “serves the important role of signalling to people that they must be aware and cautious that their alcohol and drug use may lead to consequences they do not intend and cannot control” (para. 206). Similarly, the interveners the Attorney General of Saskatchewan and LEAF argue that s. 33.1 denounces wrongful behaviour and, as a result, recognizes the dignity and equality interests of victims. Because s. 33.1 includes in its reach the irresponsible use and mixing of intoxicants that could lead to automatism and violence, the law discourages such behaviour and also raises awareness about the link between extreme intoxication and violence. This benefit is not negated by the fact that some deterrence is already provided by the common law rule on intoxication or that the deterrent effect is mitigated by the fact that it needs to take hold before the offender loses control. And while I recognize that deterrence might also come if a stand‑alone offence of dangerous intoxication was enacted, I nevertheless agree that these meaningful benefits are properly ascribed to s. 33.1.

[149]                     In addition, as the Attorney General of Manitoba submits, s. 33.1 contributes to public confidence in the criminal justice system. In Creighton, McLachlin J. observed that it would “offend common notions of justice to acquit a person who has killed another of manslaughter and find him guilty instead of aggravated assault on the ground that death, as opposed to harm, was not foreseeable” (p. 54). Similarly, it was reasonable for Parliament to conclude, as suggested in the record, that it offended the public’s common notions of justice that, to take the example of Daviault, a highly intoxicated accused who intentionally ingested half‑a‑dozen beers and a bottle of brandy might completely escape liability for sexually assaulting an elderly, disabled woman. That said, given that s. 33.1 infringes the Charter as it does, it is best not to overstate the confidence to the public that its protective and accountability purposes might foster. It is too easy to lose sight of the fact that, as Wallace J. wrote in R. v. Dunn (1999), 28 C.R. (5th) 295 (Ont. C.J. (Gen. Div.)), “society’s interests must also include a system of law, governed by the principles of fundamental justice” (para. 32). Principles of fundamental justice are recognized as such because they form basic tenets of the legal system in which there is some “general acceptance among reasonable people” that the principle is vital or fundamental to societal notions of justice (Malmo-Levine, at para. 112 (emphasis deleted); Motor Vehicle Reference, at p. 503; Rodriguez v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 1993 CanLII 75 (SCC), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 519, at pp. 590‑91 and 607). In denying the presumption of innocence, s. 33.1 unwittingly serves to compromise the full promise of the confidence that Parliament designed it to promote.

[150]                     There is a manifest benefit to be connected with the accountability purpose of Parliament described above which, in my respectful view, the majority of the Court of Appeal in Sullivan should have considered as part of the full measure of the beneficial effects of s. 33.1 (see, on this point, Coughlan, at p. 158). Section 33.1 targets the offender’s choice to create a risk of harm by becoming extremely intoxicated. One of the benefits of s. 33.1 is that it fosters personal responsibility in respect of voluntary intoxication that Parliament saw as one of the root sources of violent crime. To ignore that policy is to diminish one of the benefits of the impugned law which — however imperfectly — sought to impose that ethic of personal responsibility as a key to breaking the connection between intoxication and violence. I note that Lauwers J.A. did take this dimension of s. 33.1 into consideration in his justification analysis and the majority considered the matter in the alternative and that neither felt this factor, on its own, tipped the scales in the ultimate balancing under Oakes.

[151]                     At the end of the day, Parliament’s own accountability objective was undone by the very means it chose to pursue it. In holding the extreme self‑intoxicated offender to account, s. 33.1 does not require objective foreseeability of the risk of falling into a state of automatism, much less the risk of consequential harm. Parliament’s goal may have been to impose personal responsibility for the creation of the risk of harm, but in the absence of a requirement of reasonable foreseeability, that goal is frustrated. The Minister said in the House — his point was echoed by the Crown in this appeal and the Sullivan and Chan appeals — that s. 33.1 “provides for the link between the fault in self‑induced intoxication and the harm or fault in the criminal conduct which forms the basis of the charge” (Hansard, March 27, 1995, at p. 11038). With great respect, that link is not found in s. 33.1, suggesting strongly that Parliament failed to satisfy its own announced purpose.

(ii)         Deleterious Effects

[152]                     The fundamental flaw of s. 33.1 is the risk of wrongful convictions it presents. By denying even a small fraction of accused persons the ability to raise a reasonable doubt as to the voluntariness or mens rea elements of the offence charged, s. 33.1 permits an individual to be convicted, and subject to the stigma, liberty restrictions and other consequences of a criminal conviction, for involuntary conduct. Section 33.1 runs counter to the fundamental organizing principles that are necessary to allow individuals to face the power of the state in the criminal justice system fairly, in particular the all-important presumption of innocence. It enables conviction for conduct that an accused person was not aware of and could not control and therefore cannot be a “guilty act” as defined by the underlying offences. This result follows even where individuals ingest alcohol or drugs in common‑place situations where there is no subjective or objective foresight of automatism or violence.

[153]                     I agree with the courts below that the deleterious effects of s. 33.1 are serious and troubling. As Vertes J. put it in R. v. Brenton (1999), 1999 CanLII 4334 (NWT SC), 180 D.L.R. (4th) 314 (N.W.T.S.C.), in denying the defence of automatism, s. 33.1 “casts aside the fundamental principle of voluntariness as well as the presumption of innocence, values that are enshrined in the Charter and at the very core of our criminal law system as developed over many centuries” (para. 122). In Dunn, Wallace J. concluded that there are few infringements that could be more serious because “[w]hen an accused can be convicted without proof that he intended his actions or without proof that his actions were voluntary, then absolute liability has become a component of Canadian criminal justice, the presumption of innocence is eroded and principles of fundamental justice are seriously compromised” (para. 54). In Sullivan, Paciocco J.A. wrote compellingly that “the deleterious effects of s. 33.1 include the contravention of virtually all the criminal law principles that the law relies upon to protect the morally innocent, including the venerable presumption of innocence” (para. 153), and Lauwers J.A. said that fundamental rights of the accused under ss. 7 and 11(d) are “severely limited” (para. 287). In this case, Khullar J.A. acknowledged that the negative effects on the rights of the accused are “serious and troubling” (para. 201). This is particularly true when one recalls that Parliament failed to respect its own promise, made in the preamble to Bill C‑72, to provide “full protection” to the ss. 7 and 11 rights of the accused.

[154]                     It is not unfair to say that the narrow compass of s. 33.1 limits these negative effects. Section 33.1 only applies, as we have seen, to the violent offences of general intent named in s. 33.1(3). It is also not unfair to say that the burden of showing automatism presents a high hurdle for the accused and that the law only applies to certain intoxicants that have the properties that can bring about a state akin to automatism. While these considerations may limit the number of offenders who face these negative consequences, it is best to recognize that the narrow compass argument is two‑edged. If it is indeed true that s. 33.1 does not apply to alcohol alone, for example — a point I need not decide here — then some of the benefits ascribed to the law by the Crown were already assured by the aspects of the Leary rule that denied the defence of most forms of intoxication for crimes of general intent that Daviault left intact.

[155]                     But even if its compass is narrow and its application rare, s. 33.1 limits not just one but three fundamental rights of the accused. It enables conviction where the accused acted involuntarily, where the accused did not possess the minimum level of fault required, and where the Crown has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt the essential elements of the offence for which an accused is charged. These limitations operate to put in place a regime of absolute liability that undermines many of the core beliefs used to structure our system of criminal law. It is difficult to imagine more serious limitations than the denial of voluntariness, mens rea, and the presumption of innocence all in one. An accused may be morally blameworthy in some measure for voluntarily consuming intoxicants but that blame is not the measure of guilt at law for the underlying offences set out in s. 33.1(3). With great respect, I cannot agree with Slatter J.A., who said in the balancing of salutary and deleterious effects, that “[n]o one who is truly morally innocent is impacted [by s. 33.1]” (para. 81).

[156]                     I acknowledge that some, pointing in particular to Sopinka J.’s dissent in Daviault, have argued that s. 33.1 does not create a true offence of absolute liability since extreme voluntary intoxication can bring with it a degree of fault. Contrary to the person who falls into a state of involuntariness by reason of an uncontrollable epileptic fit, for example, the voluntarily extremely intoxicated offender is [translation] “directly responsible for their lack of voluntariness” (Parent, at p. 197). But as I have endeavoured to show, it is not enough that s. 33.1 captures only the blameworthiness associated with extreme self‑intoxication when s. 33.1 fails to consider whether the offender knew or ought to have known that there was a risk they would lose control of their actions and thereby risk causing harm to others. Because s. 33.1 does not build in a criterion of objective foreseeability, it is impossible to say who, among those who voluntarily ingest intoxicants, has the degree of blameworthiness that would justify the stigma and punishment associated with the underlying offence with which they are charged.

[157]                     Where the intoxicant is licit, or where no reasonable person would anticipate the risk of automatism, whatever blameworthiness that comes from voluntary intoxication is relatively low and likely disproportionate to the punishment the individual would face if convicted for an offence committed in a state akin to automatism (see Creighton, at pp. 48‑49, citing Martineau, at p. 647). While Mr. Brown ingested an illicit drug, the trial judge found, based on expert evidence, that his reaction to the drug was not reasonably foreseeable. Even if the ingestion of magic mushrooms is not morally innocent in the broadest sense, to convict Mr. Brown for aggravated assault in light of the voluntariness and minimal mens rea requirements fixed by the Charter would, in my view, account to a wrongful conviction for the offence as charged.

[158]                     One is hard pressed to disagree with the trial judge in R. v. Chan, 2018 ONSC 3849, 365 C.C.C. (3d) 376, who observed that “Parliament is entitled to express the view that extreme self‑intoxication is morally blameworthy behaviour” (para. 152). But I respectfully disagree with him where he wrote “the morally innocent will not be punished” (para. 156). Mr. Brown may not have been blameless in deciding to consume the magic mushrooms, but he is not guilty of the crime with which he was charged according to the requirements of the Charter.

[159]                     The voir dire judge in Mr. Brown’s case was right to speak of the principles breached by s. 33.1 as “sacrosanct”. In the Motor Vehicle Reference, Lamer J., as he then was, wrote that the principle that the innocent must not be punished “has long been recognized as an essential element of a system for the administration of justice which is founded upon a belief in the dignity and worth of the human person and on the rule of law” (p. 513).

[160]                     The idea that a conviction in the absence of the required proof of blameworthiness threatens a system of criminal justice founded on the dignity and worth of the human person has been a recurring theme in our jurisprudence (see, e.g., Oakes, at p. 136; R. v. Stevens, 1988 CanLII 44 (SCC), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 1153, at p. 1175; R. v. Hess, 1990 CanLII 89 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 906, at p. 918). Where a person is punished who did not know or could not know they are committing an offence, wrote Wilson J. in Hess, that state action inflicts a grave injury on that person’s dignity and self-worth. Two comments, however, help explain the full message of this idea. First, the measure of moral innocence extends not just to the requirement of proof of subjective fault but, as Wilson J. suggests, it leaves room for offences where blameworthiness is measured on a modified objective basis, anticipating developments in the law coming later in cases such as Creighton. Section 33.1 does not do even this and, in my view, the possibility of a fairly crafted rule on criminal liability for harm caused by self-induced intoxication remains open to Parliament. Second, and importantly, the recognition of the “dignity and self-worth” of the accused does not come at the expense of the dignity and self-worth of the victims of crime, a value alluded to in the preamble of Bill C‑72. Nor is the victim’s dignity interest consigned to a second-order status if, in the balancing mandated by s. 1, s. 33.1 is struck down because of its overarching deleterious effects of state action.

[161]                     The voir dire judge rightly recognized that these principles exist to ensure that the morally innocent are not convicted (para. 89). Section 33.1 creates the risk that a person will be convicted of the underlying offence on the basis of proof of the blameworthiness associated with extreme intoxication, without regard to the objective foreseeability of harm. It holds a person to answer for their involuntary conduct. It does so without due regard to the presumption of innocence which protects against arbitrary exercise of power by the state. Potentially, s. 33.1 could apply to anyone who voluntarily consumes an intoxicant, even if they do so with restraint or for medical reasons where the reasonable person would not have foreseen even trivial or transitory physical harm. This is an extremely serious deleterious effect.

[162]                     An additional deleterious effect is that s. 33.1 disproportionately punishes for unintentional harm, contrary to the principle that punishment be proportionate to the gravity of the offence. Section 33.1 requires the offender to face full responsibility of the underlying crime even though the actus reus and mens rea of the violent offence are not met. They are exposed, at sentence, to the full brunt of punishment for that offence, subject to the sentencing judge’s exercise of discretion, according to law. This must be the focus of the deleterious effects analysis since, under s. 33.1(3), it is the violent offence for which the accused is convicted and punished. It bears repeating: the gravamen of Mr. Brown’s charged offence is not extreme intoxication, it is the violent assault that he is said to have committed while he did not have the capacity for voluntary action.

[163]                     In saying this, I have not lost sight of the often-cited public outcry that followed Daviault which the Minister of Justice of the day said was one of the driving forces behind the enactment of s. 33.1. But public outcries do not in themselves justify unconstitutional laws. And to my mind, that response was focused on the ultimate effect of allowing the defence of automatism to act as a source of impunity for the violent intoxicated offender by allowing them, in the words of the Minister of Justice in Parliament in 1995, “to escape the consequences [of the] law” (Hansard, March 27, 1995, at p. 11038). But if s. 33.1 were properly tailored to the blameworthiness of the accused — if it, for example, punished dangerous intoxication or criminally negligent intoxication leading to objectively foreseeable loss of control and non‑trivial, non‑transitory bodily harm — the accused would not escape the consequences of the law and the accountability and protective goals of Parliament would have been met. This Court’s task is not to solve the problem for Parliament of the right balance between competing interests. But it is fair to surmise that there are socially and constitutionally acceptable alternatives to the complete immunity that achieve the legitimate objectives of the law more fairly than in s. 33.1.

(iii)      Weighing the Salutary and Deleterious Effects

[164]                     As this Court held in Bedford, at the final stage of the s. 1 analysis, the negative impact of the law is weighed against the beneficial impact of the law in terms of achieving its goal for the greater public good. The impacts are weighed both qualitatively and quantitatively. As with the previous stages of the justification analysis, the state continues to bear the burden of showing that the breaches are justified having regard to Parliament’s goals. The Crown is well placed to call the social science and expert evidence required to justify the law’s impact in societal terms (Bedford, at para. 126). At the end of the day, the courts determine whether the Charter infringements resulting from state action are too high a price to pay for the benefit of the law.

[165]                     In my respectful view, the Crown has not discharged its burden of showing that the benefits suggested by the evidence are fairly realized by s. 33.1. The Crown warns of widespread sexual and intimate partner violence, with the implication that such gendered violence will go undeterred in the absence of s. 33.1. I accept that such violence exists in the severe magnitude described by the Crown. But even the current common law precludes an accused from relying on voluntary intoxication as a complete answer to crime in a broad sweep of instances of intoxicated violence. It is not the case that in the absence of what amounts to a rule of absolute liability in s. 33.1 such violence will go unpunished or undeterred. Rather, in relation to the evidence presented by the Crown, in the absence of s. 33.1, the benefits tied to accountability and protection will continue to be met, to a not unmeaningful extent, through the application of common law rules which prevent the defence of intoxication including to general intent crimes of violence. This would be truer still if a more fairly crafted rule than s. 33.1 was enacted by Parliament.

[166]                     The limits imposed on the most fundamental Charter rights in our system of criminal justice outweigh societal benefits that are already in part realized, and which Parliament can advance through other means. The weight to be accorded to the principles of fundamental justice and the presumption of innocence cannot be ignored here. In Oakes, Dickson C.J. explained that different rights and freedoms carry different weight: “Some limits on rights and freedoms protected by the Charter will be more serious than others in terms of the nature of the right or freedom violated, the extent of the violation, and the degree to which the measures which impose the limit trench upon the integral principles of a free and democratic society” (pp. 139‑40). Some rights, such as the protections in ss. 7 and 11(d), will not be easily outweighed by collective interests under s. 1. That is the case here, as s. 33.1 trenches on fundamental principles at the very core of our criminal law system, including the presumption of innocence upon which the fairness of the system itself depends. Section 33.1 creates a liability regime that disregards principles meant to protect the innocent, and communicates the message that securing a conviction is more important than respecting basic principles of justice. Balancing the salutary and deleterious effects of the law, I respectfully conclude that the impact on the principles of fundamental justice is disproportionate to its overarching public benefits. For these reasons, the limits s. 33.1 places on ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter cannot be justified in a free and democratic society.

VI.         Conclusion

[167]                     I would answer the constitutional questions as follows: s. 33.1 of the Criminal Code infringes ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter and the infringements are not justified under s. 1 of the Charter. I would allow Mr. Brown’s appeal. Section 33.1 should be declared unconstitutional and of no force or effect pursuant to s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. The trial judge concluded in this case, based on the evidence brought before her by the defence, that Mr. Brown was in a state of extreme intoxication akin to automatism. That finding was not challenged on appeal. His acquittal on the count of break and enter and committing aggravated assault was wrongly set aside because the Court of Appeal erred in deciding that s. 33.1 is constitutional. As a result, I would restore Mr. Brown’s acquittal.

[168]                     The judgment of the Court of Appeal should be set aside. The acquittal entered by Hollins J. on the count of unlawful break and enter of a dwelling house and committing aggravated assault therein should be restored; the acquittal for unlawful break and enter of a dwelling house and committing mischief to property over $5,000 should be left undisturbed.

 

                    Appeal allowed.

                    Kasirer J. —

I.               Overview

[1]                             After having voluntarily taken an overdose of a prescription drug and falling into an impaired state, David Sullivan attacked his mother with a knife and injured her gravely. He was charged with several offences, including aggravated assault and assault with a weapon. In unrelated circumstances, Thomas Chan also fell into an impaired state after he voluntarily ingested “magic mushrooms” containing a drug called psilocybin. Mr. Chan attacked his father with a knife and killed him and seriously injured his father’s partner. He was tried for manslaughter and aggravated assault.

[2]                             In their different circumstances, both Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Chan argued at their respective trials that their state of intoxication was so extreme that their actions were involuntary and could not be the basis of a guilty verdict for the violent offences of general intent brought against them. Mr. Chan argued in particular that an underlying brain injury was the significant contributing cause of his psychosis, rather than his intoxication alone, such that he was not criminally responsible pursuant to s. 16 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46.

[3]                             In the case of Mr. Sullivan, the trial judge accepted the accused was acting involuntarily but decided that the defence of extreme intoxication akin to automatism was not available by virtue of s. 33.1 of the Criminal Code. Mr. Sullivan was convicted of the two assault charges. In the case of Mr. Chan, the trial judge dismissed a constitutional challenge to s. 33.1. Mr. Chan’s brain trauma was held to be a mental disorder, but not the cause of the incapacity, which was the result of the voluntary ingestion of magic mushrooms. The trial judge in his case rejected his argument under s. 16. He was convicted of manslaughter and aggravated assault.

[4]                             Their appeals were heard together. The Court of Appeal for Ontario held that s. 33.1 violated ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and was not saved by s. 1. As a result, both Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Chan were entitled to raise the defence of automatism. Based on the findings at his trial, Mr. Sullivan’s convictions were set aside and acquittals entered. The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial for Mr. Chan because no finding of fact had been made in respect of non-mental disorder automatism in his case. The Crown has appealed both the decisions for Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Chan to this Court.

[5]                             In R. v. Brown, 2022 SCC 18, released concurrently with the reasons for judgment in these appeals, I conclude that s. 33.1 violates the Charter and is of no force or effect pursuant to s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. That conclusion is equally applicable to the Crown’s appeals in the cases at bar.

[6]                             As respondent, Mr. Sullivan has raised an issue relating to the character and force of a s. 52(1) declaration of unconstitutionality issued by a superior court. He argued before us that the trial judge had been bound by a previous declaration by a superior court judge in the province that held s. 33.1 to be of no force and effect. The issue raised by Mr. Sullivan provides an opportunity to clarify whether a declaration made under s. 52(1) binds the courts of coordinate jurisdiction in future cases due to the principle of constitutional supremacy, or whether the ordinary rules of horizontal stare decisis apply. As I shall endeavour to explain, stare decisis does apply and the trial judge was only bound to that limited extent on the question of the constitutionality of s. 33.1. The right approach can be stated plainly. Superior courts at first instance may not be bound if the prior decision is distinguishable on its facts or if the court had no practical way of knowing that the earlier decision existed. Otherwise, the decision is binding and the judge may only depart from it if one or more of the exceptions helpfully explained in Re Hansard Spruce Mills, 1954 CanLII 253 (BC SC), [1954] 4 D.L.R. 590 (B.C.S.C.), apply.

[7]                             In the result, I would dismiss the Crown’s appeal in the case of Mr. Sullivan and confirm the acquittals entered by the Court of Appeal.

[8]                             As respondent in his appeal before this Court, Mr. Chan seeks leave to cross-appeal and, if granted, he asks that we substitute an acquittal for the order of a new trial. I would reject Mr. Chan’s arguments on this point. In my view, Mr. Chan’s application for leave to cross‑appeal must be quashed for want of jurisdiction. I would reject his alternative argument that this Court order a stay of proceedings in respect of the very serious violent charges brought against Mr. Chan because the requirements for a stay have not been made out. In the result, I would confirm the Court of Appeal’s order of a new trial.

II.            Background

A.           David Sullivan

[9]                             All parties agree that Mr. Sullivan attacked his mother during an episode of drug-induced psychosis during which he had no voluntary control over his actions. Mr. Sullivan, then 43 years old, lived with his mother in a condominium unit. He has a history of mental illness and substance abuse. Evidence adduced at trial indicated that in the three months before the attack, he was convinced that the planet would be invaded by aliens that were already present in their condominium.

[10]                        Mr. Sullivan had been prescribed bupropion (under the name Wellbutrin) to help him quit smoking. Psychosis is a side effect of the drug. He had experienced psychosis from Wellbutrin at least once before, shortly before the events in this case. The evening prior to the attack, he ingested 30 to 80 Wellbutrin tablets in a suicide attempt. The drugs prompted a psychotic episode during which time, in the early hours of the morning, he woke his mother and told her an alien was in the living room. She followed him into the area and, while she was there, Mr. Sullivan went into the kitchen, took two knives, and stabbed his mother six times. She suffered serious injuries, including residual nerve damage that was slow to heal. She died before trial of unrelated causes.

[11]                        Several neighbours saw Mr. Sullivan acting erratically outside of the building after the attack. Agitated when the police arrived, Mr. Sullivan was talking about Jesus, the devil, and aliens. He was taken to the hospital, where he had multiple seizures. The psychotic episode resolved itself within a few days. At trial, a forensic psychiatrist gave evidence that Mr. Sullivan was likely experiencing a bupropion‑induced psychosis at the time of the attack on his mother.

B.            Thomas Chan

[12]                        Thomas Chan violently attacked his father and his father’s partner with a knife. Mr. Chan’s father later died from his injuries. The father’s partner was gravely and permanently injured.

[13]                        After returning home from a bar where they had consumed several alcoholic drinks earlier that evening, Mr. Chan and his friends decided to take magic mushrooms. Mr. Chan had consumed mushrooms before and enjoyed the experience. He ingested an initial dose and when he failed to feel the same effects as his friends, he took a second dose. Towards the end of the night, he began acting erratically. Frightened, he went upstairs where he woke up his mother, mother’s boyfriend, and sister. Mr. Chan then left the home wearing only a pair of pants. His family and friends pursued him as he ran towards his father’s home a short distance away. Mr. Chan broke into his father’s house through a window even though he normally gained entry through finger-print recognition on a home security system.

[14]                        Once inside, he confronted his father in the kitchen and did not appear to recognize him. He shouted that he was God and that his father was Satan. He proceeded to stab his father repeatedly. He then stabbed his father’s partner. When police arrived, he complied with their demands, although at one point he struggled with what a police officer described as “super‑strength”.

III.         Proceedings Below

A.           David Sullivan

Ontario Superior Court of Justice, [2016] O.J. No. 6847 (QL), 2016 CarswellOnt 21197 (WL Can.) (Salmers J.)

[15]                        At trial, the parties agreed, and the trial judge accepted, that Mr. Sullivan was acting involuntarily when he stabbed his mother. The trial judge found that Mr. Sullivan experienced a state of non‑mental disorder automatism, attributable to his ingestion of Wellbutrin. His state was caused by a drug for which psychosis is a known side‑effect.

[16]                        The Crown said s. 33.1 applied because Mr. Sullivan’s psychosis was self‑induced and therefore could not be the basis for a defence that he lacked the general intent or voluntariness for the crimes of assault. There was disagreement about whether Mr. Sullivan’s consumption of Wellbutrin was voluntary. Section 33.1 would only preclude the automatism defence if intoxication was “self‑induced”. The trial judge found that Mr. Sullivan’s intoxication was voluntary and that he knew or ought to have known that Wellbutrin would cause him to be impaired. Section 33.1 was applied. He was found guilty of aggravated assault, assault with a weapon, and four counts of breach of a non-communication order. It bears noting that Mr. Sullivan did not contest the constitutionality of s. 33.1 at trial. He received a global sentence of five years.

B.            Thomas Chan

(1)         Constitutional Ruling, 2018 ONSC 3849, 365 C.C.C. (3d) 376 (Boswell J.)

[17]                        Mr. Chan challenged the constitutionality of s. 33.1 in a pre‑trial application, arguing in particular that the trial judge was bound by previous decisions of the same court, notably R. v. Dunn (1999), 28 C.R. (5th) 295 (Ont. C.J. (Gen. Div.)), and R. v. Fleming, 2010 ONSC 8022, which found s. 33.1 to be unconstitutional.

[18]                        Boswell J. considered whether, by reason of the doctrine of horizontal stare decisis, he was bound by a constitutional declaration by another judge of the superior court in the province that s. 33.1 was of no force or effect because it was inconsistent with the Charter. Relying on R. v. Scarlett, 2013 ONSC 562, the trial judge held that he was not so bound. Decisions from courts of coordinate jurisdiction should be followed in the absence of cogent reasons to depart therefrom. A court is bound unless the previous decision is “plainly wrong” (paras. 55‑56). The trial judge reasoned that the case law on the constitutionality of s. 33.1 was “considerably unsettled” (para. 58). Although all courts had agreed that s. 33.1 violated ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter, courts were divided on whether it could be saved under s. 1. As a result, Boswell J. did not “feel constrained to follow one school of thought more than the other” (ibid.). In addition, none of the earlier constitutional decisions had had the benefit of the judgment of the Court in Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, 2013 SCC 72, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1101, on the relationship between ss. 7 and 1 (para. 58). He concluded that he was free to reconsider the question afresh.

[19]                        The trial judge then went on to decide that s. 33.1 violated ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter but was saved under s. 1.

(2)         Judgment on the Merits, 2018 ONSC 7158 (Boswell J.)

[20]                        With the defence of automatism precluded by operation of s. 33.1, Mr. Chan argued that he was not criminally responsible by reason of brain trauma which, alone or in connection with the effect of the intoxicant, amounted to mental disorder under s. 16. The parties disagreed about whether Mr. Chan was suffering from a brain injury and, if so, whether it played a part in his violent conduct. Mr. Chan argued that but for the brain injury, he would not have been psychotic from consuming the mushrooms. The Crown argued that the primary cause of Mr. Chan’s psychosis was his voluntary consumption of the mushrooms. The trial judge was required to consider, first, whether Mr. Chan was suffering from a mental disorder at the time of the offence and, second, if that mental disorder rendered him incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of his actions, or incapable of knowing they were wrong.

[21]                        Mr. Chan did not satisfy the applicable requirements under s. 16. The evidence disclosed a mild traumatic brain injury. The trial judge could not conclusively say that the brain injury rendered Mr. Chan incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of his actions or of knowing they were wrong. The progression of his psychosis suggested that the ingestion of psilocybin was the primary cause of Mr. Chan’s impaired state. The judge found that “Mr. Chan experienced a sudden onset of psychosis that coincided directly with the ingestion and absorption of magic mushrooms”. While the trial judge found that Mr. Chan “was incapacitated by the effects of the drugs he consumed”, I note that he made no specific finding that Mr. Chan was in a state of self‑induced intoxication akin to non‑mental disorder automatism.

[22]                        Mr. Chan was convicted of manslaughter and aggravated assault. He was later sentenced to a global sentence of five years, reduced to three and a half years after credit reductions (2019 ONSC 1400).

(3)         Application to Re-open Constitutional Challenge, 2019 ONSC 783, 428 C.R.R. (2d) 81 (Boswell J.)

[23]                        After sentencing, Mr. Chan applied to re‑open the case to re‑argue the constitutional issue. He said that R. v. McCaw, 2018 ONSC 3464, 48 C.R. (7th) 359, which had been rendered subsequently, declared s. 33.1 unconstitutional and therefore presented a renewed opportunity to consider the question. In McCaw, Spies J. said she was bound by Dunn. Spies J. held that once a provision is declared unconstitutional, it is invalid and “off the books” (para. 76) for all future cases by operation of s. 52(1) and as directed in R. v. Ferguson, 2008 SCC 6, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 96. In other words, judges of concurrent jurisdiction are bound by a declaration of unconstitutionality. On that basis, argued Mr. Chan, the trial judge had been bound by the prior declaration of unconstitutionality in Dunn when he considered the application of s. 33.1 here.

[24]                        Boswell J. dismissed Mr. Chan’s application to re‑open the case. McCaw was not an accurate statement of the law. Relying on Spruce Mills, a proper understanding of the rule of horizontal stare decisis is that relevant decisions of the same level of court should be followed as a matter of judicial comity, unless there are compelling reasons that justify departing therefrom. Spruce Mills set out three criteria for departure, which were summarized correctly, in his view, by Strathy J. in Scarlett as “plainly wrong” (para. 41).

[25]                        For Boswell J., McCaw misinterpreted the statements by McLachlin C.J. in Ferguson that an unconstitutional law is “effectively removed from the statute books” (para. 65). McLachlin C.J. did not express the view that judges of coordinate jurisdiction could not review or reconsider an order striking down a provision under s. 52. Ferguson was not about horizontal stare decisis. Boswell J. preferred Strathy J.’s reading of Ferguson, which acknowledged the erga omnes (“against all” or, as is sometimes said, “against the world”) character of a declaration of unconstitutionality but did not extend that effect to courts of coordinate jurisdiction. The question remained as to whether the prior ruling is plainly wrong and there are salient reasons for correcting the error. With respect to Dunn, there were good reasons to depart from precedent. The s. 1 analysis was plainly wrong; Bedford had changed the relationship between ss. 7 and 1. Moreover there were inconsistent rulings on the matter of the constitutionality of s. 33.1 across the country.

C.            Court of Appeal for Ontario, 2020 ONCA 333, 151 O.R. (3d) 353 (Paciocco J.A., Watt J.A. concurring; Lauwers J.A. concurring in the result)

[26]                        The Court of Appeal allowed the appeals and held that s. 33.1 is unconstitutional and of no force or effect. The Court of Appeal’s judgment on this point is reviewed in Brown and need not be recounted here in detail. For the purposes of this case, I need only note that Paciocco J.A.’s careful reasoning on ss. 7 and 11(d) has been affirmed in Brown. In addition, although my own justification analysis differs from that of Paciocco and Lauwers JJ.A., I agree with their ultimate conclusion: s. 33.1 cannot be saved by s. 1. Their conclusion that s. 33.1 is inconsistent with the Charter and of no force or effect is equally applicable in these two appeals.

[27]                        Speaking for the Court on this point, Paciocco J.A. addressed the issue of whether the trial judge in Mr. Chan’s case was bound by precedent of a court of coordinate jurisdiction in the province to accept the unconstitutionality of s. 33.1.

[28]                        In his view, the ordinary rules of stare decisis apply when superior courts in first instance consider whether to follow previous declarations of unconstitutionality made by the same court. He distinguished several cases that purported to stand for the proposition that a declaration is binding on other superior court judges unless successfully appealed by the Crown (paras. 34‑35, referring to Nova Scotia (Workers’ Compensation Board) v. Martin, 2003 SCC 54, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 504; Canada (Attorney General) v. Hislop, 2007 SCC 10, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 429; and Ferguson). These cases made statements to the effect that a provision inconsistent with the Constitution “is invalid from the moment it is enacted” in all future cases and is “effectively removed from the statute books” (Martin, at paras. 28 and 31; see Ferguson, at para. 65; Hislop, at para. 82). Paciocco J.A. read these cases as describing the effect of s. 52(1) declarations rendered by the Supreme Court because it is the apex court in Canada. They did not oust the principles of stare decisis generally nor did they pertain to declarations made by lower courts.

[29]                        If all s. 52(1) declarations were binding, wrote Paciocco J.A., accuracy would be compromised. For example, if three superior court judges in succession upheld a provision, but a fourth judge’s ruling declared it to be of no force and effect, only the fourth judge’s ruling would take hold within a province absent an appeal by the Crown. The development of the law would be “driven by coincidence” rather than by the “quality of the judicial ruling” (para. 37).

[30]                        The principles in Spruce Mills and Scarlett were affirmed. Applied to the context of s. 52(1) declarations of unconstitutionality, a superior court judge faced with a prior judgment of a court of coordinate jurisdiction should apply that precedent and treat the provision as having no force or effect unless, by exception to the principle of horizontal stare decisis, the earlier decision is plainly wrong. The trial judge was correct to decide that he was not bound by Dunn and entitled to consider the issue afresh.

[31]                        Having declared s. 33.1 unconstitutional and of no force or effect, Paciocco J.A. entered acquittals for Mr. Sullivan on his assault charges. Mr. Chan was entitled to a new trial, but not acquittals. The trial judge made no finding that Mr. Chan was acting involuntarily. Instead, the trial judge rejected Mr. Chan’s claim that he should be found not criminally responsible, a claim that does not require the establishment of automatism. Mr. Chan should have the opportunity to invoke the defence of non‑mental automatism and lead evidence in that regard at a new trial.

IV.         Issues

[32]                        As noted, the Crown appeals on the constitutionality of s. 33.1 cannot succeed for the reasons stated in Brown. The Court of Appeal correctly concluded that s. 33.1 infringes ss. 7 and 11(d) and cannot be saved under s. 1.

[33]                        There are two remaining issues in these appeals:

1.      On what basis can a declaration issued by a superior court pursuant to s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 be considered binding on courts of coordinate jurisdiction?

2.      Does the Court have jurisdiction to hear Mr. Chan’s cross‑appeal? If so, is he entitled to an acquittal? If not, is he nevertheless entitled to a stay of proceedings?

[34]                        For the reasons that follow, I conclude on the first issue that the ordinary rules of stare decisis and judicial comity apply to declarations of unconstitutionality issued by superior courts within the same province. On the second issue, I conclude the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the cross‑appeal. I would not order a stay. The Court of Appeal’s order for a new trial for Mr. Chan should be upheld, as should the acquittals it entered for Mr. Sullivan.

V.           Analysis

A.           Section 52(1) Declarations of Unconstitutionality and Horizontal Stare Decisis

[35]                        Presented in the General Part of the Constitution Act, 1982 under the heading “Primacy of Constitution of Canada”, s. 52(1) provides:

52 (1) The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada, and any law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect.

[36]                        The parties disagree on the rules that apply after a superior court declares a law inconsistent with the Charter and thus of no force or effect pursuant to s. 52(1).

[37]                        Mr. Sullivan observes that at the time he was convicted at trial, s. 33.1 had already been declared of no force and effect by other judges of the superior court in the province of Ontario. He recalls that starting in Dunn, in 1999, four separate superior court judgments were rendered “striking [s. 33.1] down” (R.F., at para. 85). Mr. Sullivan says that a declaration issued by a court of coordinate jurisdiction under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 invalidates the law for all future cases. In deciding the contrary, the trial judge in Mr. Chan’s case and the Court of Appeal failed to recognize the effect on the law of the declaration issued under s. 52(1). Paciocco J.A., writing for a unanimous court on this point in appeal, erred in deciding that the matter is governed by the ordinary principles of stare decisis and by adopting the test of judicial comity explained in Scarlett and Spruce Mills.

[38]                        Mr. Sullivan, along with a number of interveners, submit that a superior court only “discovers” that a law is unconstitutional when it issues a declaration pursuant to s. 52(1) — the law becomes of no force or effect through the operation of s. 52(1). He relies on statements from this Court which characterize a s. 52(1) declaration as rendering the law “null and void”, a finding which applies “for all future cases” and that the law is unenforceable because it is “effectively removed from the statute books” (Martin, at para. 31; Ferguson, at para. 65, Hislop, at para. 82). Consistent with those statements, says Mr. Sullivan, when a superior court issues a s. 52(1) declaration of unconstitutionality, the impugned provision is nullified both prospectively and retrospectively. The intervener British Columbia Civil Liberties Association argues further that, by its nature, a s. 52(1) declaration by a superior court has universal effect beyond the parties “for all Canadians” and thus must bind courts across the country. The intervener Advocates for the Rule of Law adds that a s. 52(1) declaration derives its force from the Constitution and that permitting the government to relitigate a law’s constitutionality after it has been declared of no force or effect would be inconsistent with the Constitution’s remedial scheme. Finally, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association intervenes to warn of the potential undermining of the rule of law and consequential unpredictability if the ordinary rules of stare decisis apply.

[39]                        Although it argues that the Court of Appeal made no mistake in holding that the ordinary rules of stare decisis apply here, the Crown recalls that the matter is technically moot. Even if the trial judges were obliged to follow Dunn, this Court is not so bound and the lower courts’ failure to do so has no practical impact on the outcome of these appeals. But, says the Crown, the question raised by Mr. Sullivan should still be decided.

[40]                        I agree that the matter can and should be decided here (Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada, SOR/2002‑156, r. 29(3); R. v. Poulin, 2019 SCC 47, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 566, at paras. 18‑26). The question is one of public importance to the conduct of constitutional litigation in courts of first instance in Canada. Moreover the question was carefully considered by the courts below and, in this Court, has been addressed by the parties with additional submissions on either side of the question by interveners.

[41]                        On the substance of the matter, the Crown argues that while s. 52(1) declarations are erga omnes in nature, they do not necessarily stand as authority for all future cases to be decided of coordinate jurisdiction or bind across the country. Mr. Sullivan’s approach compromises the rule of law by allowing for erroneous findings of unconstitutionality to stand. The rules of stare decisis provide the flexibility needed to balance finality with correctness.

[42]                        The Attorneys General of British Columbia, Quebec and Canada intervene in support of the Crown’s position. British Columbia submits that a s. 52(1) declaration should be reconsidered only where there is palpable and overriding error or where the threshold in Bedford is met. Quebec argues the “plainly wrong” standard should be qualified; a previous decision should only be set aside where there is a new question of law or a change in the situation or evidence that leads to materially different circumstances. Canada observes that disagreement between lower courts helpfully generates considered opinions upon which appellate courts can rely for their own reasoning.

[43]                        For the reasons that follow, I agree with the Crown that the trial judge was not strictly bound by the prior declaration by a court of coordinate jurisdiction by virtue of s. 52(1). In my respectful view, Mr. Sullivan’s understanding of the effect of a declaration under s. 52(1) is mistaken. A s. 52(1) declaration of unconstitutionality reflects an ordinary judicial task of determining a question of law, in this case with respect to the consistency of a law with the requirements of the Charter. Questions of law are governed by the normal rules and conventions that constrain courts in the performance of their judicial tasks.

[44]                        In the result, I agree with the conclusion reached by Paciocco J.A. that the ordinary principles of stare decisis govern the manner in which a declaration issued by a court under s. 52(1) affects how courts of coordinate jurisdiction in the province should decide future cases raising the same issue. I would however clarify the situations when a superior court may depart from a prior judgment of a court of coordinate jurisdiction. The standard is not that the prior decision was “plainly wrong”. A superior court judge in first instance should follow prior decisions made by their own court on all questions of law, including questions of constitutional law, unless one or more of the exceptions in Spruce Mills are met.

(1)         Section 52(1) Declarations of Unconstitutionality Reflect the Exercise of Judicial Power to Decide Questions of Law

[45]                        I start with a simple point: in issuing a declaration that a law is inconsistent with the Constitution and thus of no force or effect, a judge is exercising an ordinary judicial power to determine a question of law. Given the nature of the power they exercise, judges cannot in a literal sense “strike down legislation” when they review the consistency of the law with the Constitution under s. 52(1). Mr. Sullivan misconstrues the power of judges when he says that the effect of a declaration of unconstitutionality is that the impugned law is removed from the statute books going forward. In our law, legislatures have the power to remove laws from the statute books, or to modify those statutes, not judges (see D. Pinard, “De l’inhabilité des juges à modifier le texte des lois déclarées inconstitutionnelles”, in P. Taillon, E. Brouillet and A. Binette, eds., Un regard québécois sur le droit constitutionnel: Mélanges en l’honneur d’Henri Brun et de Guy Tremblay (2016), 329, at p. 342). Professor Pinard convincingly frames this judicial power as one grounded in legal interpretation and recalls the distinction, that she rightly says is sometimes neglected, between legal rules and the textual expression of those rules. Judges, in their interpretative task as it bears on statutory law under s. 52(1), have no power to [translation] “alter the text of rules of written law” (p. 329, fn. 2 (emphasis deleted)). She writes:

[translation] Judicial review for constitutionality concerns the impugned rule, not the text of written law that expresses the rule. The necessary legislative reworking, if any, will only be done after the judgment of unconstitutionality, by the relevant legislature. [p. 347]

[46]                        Contrary to what Mr. Sullivan suggests, while s. 33.1 was declared to be inconsistent with the Constitution and of no force or effect in Dunn, it was not, by the effect of that judgment, “struck from the books”. As I seek to explain below, when this Court in Ferguson stated that a law is effectively removed from the statute books, it was not speaking in literal terms. The effect of the judicial declaration in this case, where s. 33.1 is considered to be inconsistent with the Constitution, is not to annul the law but, as the French text of s. 52(1) makes especially plain, to declare that it is “inopérante” (see M.‑A. Gervais, “Les impasses théoriques et pratiques du contrôle de constitutionnalité canadien” (2021), 66 McGill L.J. 509, at p. 521, at fn. 45, citing P.‑A. Côté, “La préséance de la Charte canadienne des droits et libertés” (1984), 18 R.J.T. 105, at pp. 108‑10; see also F. Gélinas, “La primauté du droit et les effets d’une loi inconstitutionnelle” (1988), 67 Can. Bar Rev. 455, at pp. 463‑64).

[47]                        A second equally simple point flows from the first and also appears to have been neglected by Mr. Sullivan. In authorizing a competent judge to issue a declaration under s. 52(1), the Constitution Act, 1982 also invites the court to decide an ordinary question of law, albeit one with constitutional implications. Specifically, s. 52(1) asks the court to determine whether the impugned law is “inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution” and, if so, to measure “the extent of this inconsistency” to decide whether and to what extent the law is of no force or effect. To do so, the court interprets the impugned law and interprets the Constitution. In Mr. Chan’s case, the trial judge was called upon to determine whether there was an inconsistency between the Charter and s. 33.1. To decide that, he had to resolve the legal question relating to the meaning of ss. 7, 11(d) and 1 of the Charter and the meaning of s. 33.1.

[48]                        Notwithstanding the heady constitutional context, these are ordinary judicial tasks raising questions of law. Under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, courts are called upon to resolve conflicts between the Constitution and ordinary statutes (Reference re Manitoba Language Rights, 1985 CanLII 33 (SCC), [1985] 1 S.C.R. 721, at p. 746). Properly understood, the supremacy clause refers to the hierarchy of laws in the constitutional order. Superior courts are empowered to determine whether a provision is inconsistent with the Constitution in accordance with this hierarchy. These questions of law are no different than other questions of law decided outside the constitutional context (A. Marcotte, “A Question of Law: (Formal) Declarations of Invalidity and the Doctrine of Stare Decisis” (2021), 42 N.J.C.L. 1, at p. 9). Judicial review of legislation on federalism or Charter grounds has been described as a “normal judicial task” similar to the “interpretation of a statute” (P. W. Hogg and W. K. Wright, Constitutional Law of Canada (5th ed. Supp.), at §5-21; R. Leckey, Bills of Rights in the Common Law (2015), at p. 55). As judicial review of legislation is an ordinary judicial task consisting of the determination of a question of law, the legal effects of the declaration of unconstitutionality that results should be governed by the ordinary rules of stare decisis (Marcotte, at p. 21). In its effect, a declaration of unconstitutionality simply refutes the presumption of constitutionality by deciding that the impugned provisions are inconsistent with the Constitution and therefore of no force or effect. It does not alter the terms of the statute (see, e.g., R. v. P. (J.) (2003), 2003 CanLII 17492 (ON CA), 67 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.), at para. 31; Gervais, at pp. 535‑38).

[49]                        Having indicated my view that a s. 52(1) declaration of unconstitutionality is an ordinary judicial task that involves resolving a question of law rather than an expression of the authority of a superior court to alter the statute book, I now turn to the legal nature and effect of a s. 52(1) declaration beyond the parties to litigation.

(2)         Stare Decisis Governs Declarations of Unconstitutionality

[50]                        Mr. Sullivan argues that an unconstitutional law is invalid from the moment it was first enacted, due to the operation of s. 52(1) and the principle of constitutional supremacy. In effect, s. 52(1) renders a law invalid or “null and void” retrospectively and prospectively. As a result, when a superior court “discovers” that legislation is unconstitutional, absent an appeal, the legislation is null and void for all future cases. In support of this argument, he points specifically to the judgment of Spies J. in McCaw who decided she was bound by a previous judgment of her court in Dunn declaring that s. 33.1 was unconstitutional where the Crown had chosen not to appeal. Spies J. relied specifically on Ferguson for this conclusion: “To the extent that the law is unconstitutional, it is not merely inapplicable for the purposes of the case at hand. It is null and void, and is effectively removed from the statute books” (Ferguson, at para. 65, cited by Spies J. in McCaw, at para. 60).

[51]                        I respectfully disagree.

[52]                        Understanding the comments of this Court in Ferguson requires the reader to recall the context in which that case was rendered. The Court rejected the argument, in connection with the application of mandatory minimum sentences, that individual exemptions be granted by judges from otherwise unconstitutional laws. McLachlin C.J. sought to underscore, in understandably strong language, that a s. 52(1) declaration did not operate on a case-by-case remedial basis as would a constitutional remedy available under s. 24(1) of the Charter, but instead that the issuing court’s declaration that the law was of no force or effect was applicable erga omnes. The impugned legislation was not to be applied, as a matter of course, to some litigants and not others according to judicial discretion (see Ferguson, at para. 35).

[53]                        That said, Ferguson does not change the fact that the declaration remains an exercise of judicial power by which a judge determines a question of law. As such, the determination of that question of law is binding erga omnes as a matter precedent, according to the ordinary rules of stare decisis, and not because that law has been truly removed from the statute books (see H. Brun, G. Tremblay and E. Brouillet, Droit constitutionnel (6th ed. 2014), at para. I.54). Judges, of course, do not have that latter power. To suggest that, by its use of a figure of speech, this Court lost sight of this is, in my view, a mistaken reading of the case. I note that some scholars have similarly commented upon the formulation of the observations in Ferguson and like observations made by this Court as to the effect of a s. 52(1) declaration (see, e.g., Marcotte, at pp. 13‑14 and 16‑17; Pinard, at p. 349). Indeed Ferguson points to a plain understanding that the declaration issued under s. 52(1) is the exercise of judicial power that has an erga omnes vocation. I read the occasional references to s. 52(1) as judgments in rem in the cases (see, e.g., Ravndahl v. Saskatchewan, 2009 SCC 7, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 181, at para. 27), in the same way. A judgment in rem applies beyond the immediate parties but, ultimately, even in the context of a s. 52(1) declaration, it remains a judgment: an exercise of judicial power that determines a question of law (Coquitlam (City) v. Construction Aggregates Ltd. (1998), 1998 CanLII 1910 (BC SC), 65 B.C.L.R. (3d) 275 (S.C.), at paras. 11‑17, aff’d 2000 BCCA 301, 75 B.C.L.R. (3d) 350, leave to appeal dismissed, [2001] 1 S.C.R. ix, cited in Marcotte, at p. 14, fn. 64; see also L. Sarna, The Law of Declaratory Judgments (4th ed. 2016), at p. 158). It is binding precedent, to be sure, but within the proper limits of the doctrine of stare decisis.

[54]                        I am thus content to read Ferguson as a useful figure of speech rather than take what the Court said in literal terms. McLachlin C.J. sought to show, in connection with the dispute as to remedy before the Court in that case, that under s. 52(1), as opposed to s. 24(1) of the Charter, the law was unconstitutional erga omnes and not on a case-by-case basis. At a technical level, it is true that the explanation for that is rooted in s. 52(1), as other cases have suggested. But ultimately, that effect requires the exercise of judicial power to declare the law to be unconstitutional. And the exercise of that power requires the judge to make a determination of an ordinary question of law: by interpreting the impugned law and the relevant provisions of the Constitution, whether the impugned law is inconsistent with Canada’s supreme law. If so, then the law is, of course, of no force or effect for all future cases, insofar as that judicial declaration made under s. 52(1) by a superior court is binding on other courts and within the right confines of the law relating to precedent. Other decisions of this Court that use the language of “striking out” or “striking down” or “severing” statutory text should be understood in a similarly figurative manner, rendering the text merely inoperative pursuant to s. 52(1) as opposed to altering or repealing the text in the literal sense (see Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission) v. Whatcott, 2013 SCC 11, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 467, at para. 94, and R. v. St-Onge Lamoureux, 2012 SCC 57, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 187, at para. 67, cited in Pinard, at pp. 331‑34; Schachter v. Canada, 1992 CanLII 74 (SCC), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 679, at p. 695; Gervais, at p. 530; see also Windsor (City) v. Canadian Transit Co., 2016 SCC 54, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 617, at para. 70; R. v. Lloyd, 2016 SCC 4 (CanLII), 2016 SCC 130, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 13, at para. 15; P. W. Hogg and A. A. Bushell, “The Charter Dialogue Between Courts and Legislatures” (1997), 35 Osgoode Hall L.J. 75, at p. 100).

[55]                        Similarly, the principle from Martin that the “invalidity of a legislative provision inconsistent with the Charter does not arise from the fact of its being declared unconstitutional by a court, but from the operation of s. 52(1)” must be understood in its entire context (para. 28). Martin concerned the ability of administrative tribunals to consider the constitutionality of provisions of their enabling statutes (para. 27). Gonthier J. determined that an administrative tribunal empowered to consider and decide questions of law through its enabling statute must also have the power to determine a provision’s consistency with the Charter because its constitutionality is a question of law (K. Roach, Constitutional Remedies in Canada (2nd ed. (loose-leaf)), at § 6:3). Such a determination is not binding on future decision-makers (paras. 28 and 31). Importantly, Gonthier J. added that only through “obtaining a formal declaration of invalidity by a [superior] court can a litigant establish the general invalidity of a legislative provision for all future cases” (para. 31), a point taken up in later cases of this Court (Mouvement laïque québécois v. Saguenay (City), 2015 SCC 16, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 153; Okwuobi v. Lester B. Pearson School Board, 2005 SCC 16, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 257, at paras. 43‑44; Ontario (Attorney General) v. G, 2020 SCC 38, at para. 88). In other words, it is the constitutional determination of a superior court judge that binds future decision makers (R. v. Albashir, 2021 SCC 48, at paras. 64‑65). The inconsistency spoken to in s. 52(1) is revealed through litigation, specifically the judgment that declares the inoperability of the impugned law. The doctrine of stare decisis extends the effect of that judgment beyond the parties to the case, erga omnes within the province at least — subject to the limits of the doctrine itself. The issue in these appeals concerns the binding nature of such a judgment, and, in my view, consonant with our jurisprudence, a s. 52(1) declaration establishes unconstitutionality “for all future cases” through the authority of the judgment that makes that declaration. I agree with Paciocco J.A., at para. 34 of the judgment in appeal, that Gonthier J. was not seeking to alter the principles of stare decisis in Martin.

[56]                        I add that this explanation does not reduce the declaration to an individual remedy, as some interveners suggest. While it is true that stare decisis pertains to the reasons given by a court and a s. 52(1) declaration is a remedy, the reasons explain the status of the impugned law in terms of its consistency with the Constitution. The constitutional status of the law is, as I say, a question of law. The scope of the legal reasoning extends beyond the individual claimant, with effect beyond the parties flowing from the binding character of the judgment as a matter of precedent (Albashir, at para. 65). The granting of a personal remedy under s. 24(1), in contrast, is a highly factual exercise, involving the application of law to a specific context — that someone has obtained a s. 24(1) remedy in a case says very little about whether a subsequent claimant is entitled to the same relief (Ferguson, at paras. 59-61; Albashir, at para. 65).

[57]                        In other words, in McCaw, Spies J. was right to conclude she was not free to ignore prior decisions but, with respect, she arrived at that conclusion for what appears to be the wrong reason (para. 76). It was right to say that, in considering whether to follow Dunn, the court was obliged to consider s. 33.1 as having been declared, by a judge of her court, as unconstitutional. But the result of that declaration was not that s. 33.1 was “off the books” (it remains of course on the books until Parliament chooses to remove it) (para. 76). Spies J. was bound to follow precedent because as a matter of horizontal stare decisis, Dunn was binding on courts of coordinate jurisdiction in the province as a matter of judicial comity, unless an exception to horizontal stare decisis was established. It was true that s. 33.1 was of no force and effect. It was true that the declaration in Dunn applied not just to the parties in that case but to all future cases. But, with respect, it was wrong to say that “judicial comity has no relevance to the issue before me” (McCaw, at para. 76). If she had concluded that Dunn had been rendered per incuriam (“through carelessness” or “by inadvertence”), for example, it would not have been binding on the court in McCaw based on the ordinary rules of stare decisis as interpreted in Spruce Mills. Indeed, as suggested by this Court in Martin, Spies J. could not apply an invalid law. It is certainly true, as suggested in Ferguson, that she had “no discretion” to do so (para. 35). Yet Spies J. was bound, as a matter of precedent, by the prior judgment of a court of coordinate jurisdiction to consider s. 33.1 to be unconstitutional, insofar as the doctrine of horizontal stare decisis so required.

[58]                        By contrast, in Mr. Chan’s case, Boswell J. decided, as a matter of discerning applicable and binding precedent, that Dunn did not bind him. While he may have erred in respect of his explanation as to why Dunn was not binding, he was right to consider the matter from the point of view of binding precedent and the doctrine of horizontal stare decisis.

[59]                        I would add — and here I likely part company with the Court of Appeal in the present case — that the same principles apply to judicial declarations made by this Court under s. 52(1). I respectfully disagree with the view that, as the apex court in the Canadian judicial system, the Supreme Court of Canada is invested with a special mandate to strike laws from the books. The judges of this Court are judges, not legislators. If it is true that the declarations of this Court under s. 52(1) have a qualitatively different effect than declarations made by judges of other courts, it is on the basis of vertical stare decisis — the idea that other courts are bound to follow precedent set by higher judicial authority — and not because the Constitution has invested the judges of this Court with a power that is in some way non-judicial (see Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, 1985 CanLII 81 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, for a related expression of this same idea).

(3)         The Role of Federalism and the Rule of Law

[60]                        The principle of constitutional supremacy cannot dominate the analysis of s. 52(1) to the exclusion of other constitutional principles. Mr. Sullivan points to the idea that an unconstitutional law is invalid from the moment it is enacted. But the strict enforcement of such a principle “cannot easily be reconciled with modern constitutional law” (Albashir, at para. 40). Instead, it is subject to a number of exceptions and s. 52(1) must be read “in light of all constitutional principles” (Albashir, at paras. 40 and 42; G, at para. 88). In Albashir, my colleague Karakatsanis J. explained that declarations of unconstitutionality are generally retrospective, consistent with the notion that a law is unconstitutional from its enactment. However, other constitutional principles may require a purely prospective declaration of unconstitutionality or a suspended declaration. Similarly, the legal effect of a s. 52(1) declaration by a superior court must be defined with reference to constitutional supremacy, the rule of law, and federalism.

[61]                        It is often said there are four fundamental organizing precepts of the Constitution: federalism, democracy, constitutionalism and the rule of law and respect for minorities (see Reference re Secession of Quebec, 1998 CanLII 793 (SCC), [1998] 2 S.C.R. 217, at paras. 32, 43 and 49). Of particular importance in the context of s. 52(1), the principle of constitutional supremacy must be balanced against federalism and the rule of law (see Albashir, at paras. 30 and 34). This point has been neglected by Mr. Sullivan and some of the interveners who argue that a declaration of unconstitutionality has the effect of rendering a law null and void as “against the world” without regard for the territorial limits of the administration of justice within a province. Yet even in McCaw, Spies J. understood that effect to be limited to the province (para. 77). Author Mark Mancini acknowledges that this is linked to a proper understanding of s. 96 of the Constitution Act, 1867, which explains that because superior courts operating “within the province” only have powers within the province, courts of one province are not bound by decisions of courts of another province (“Declarations of Invalidity in Superior Courts” (2019), 28:3 Const. Forum 31, at p. 35, relying on Wolf v. The Queen, 1974 CanLII 161 (SCC), [1975] 2 S.C.R. 107; see also Gervais, at p. 561; Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at para. I.106). I agree.

[62]                        Federalism prevents a s. 52(1) declaration issued within one province from binding courts throughout the country: indeed, to allow a declaration of unconstitutionality issued by a superior court in British Columbia to bind a superior court, much less an appellate court, in Quebec or Alberta would be wholly inconsistent with our constitutional structure (see, e.g., Reference re Same-Sex Marriage, 2004 SCC 79, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 698, at para. 70). It cannot be the case that the supremacy clause compels this outcome, through the simple operation of s. 52(1) (see C.A. reasons, at para. 35). I understand this to be a major obstacle to Mr. Sullivan’s argument, not just as a matter of the territorial scope of the effect of s. 52(1) declarations, but in respect of the theoretical basis for arguing why and how they would operate outside the confines of the ordinary rules of stare decisis. If the provision of s. 33.1 was truly “off the books” because a s. 52(1) declaration resulted in it being considered null and void, it is hard to explain why — not least from the perspective of the accused in another province — it would be null and void in one part of the country and not another.

[63]                        The better view is that s. 33.1 is not null and void, but inoperative by reason of a determination of law made by a judge. That determination is binding, within the province, unless there is valid reason to depart from it. The accused is free to make that argument and a court of coordinate jurisdiction is not irretrievably bound by the prior decision within the province. Needless to say, the declaration of unconstitutionality made by a superior court in one province may be followed in another province because it is persuasive (see, e.g., Parent v. Guimond, 2016 QCCA 159, at paras. 11 et seq. (CanLII); Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at para. I.105). Thus, I reject the arguments from Mr. Sullivan and the interveners that a s. 52(1) declaration is of such a unique legal character that, once a declaration is issued anywhere in the country, its effect is that the impugned legislation is “no longer in the system” from coast to coast. Instead, a s. 52(1) declaration is the end-result of a judge’s ability to resolve questions of law and should be observed by courts of coordinate jurisdiction within the province as a matter of stare decisis: nothing more or less.

[64]                        It follows there is no supplementary power held by courts when issuing a declaration of unconstitutionality beyond the strictures imposed by the rules of stare decisis. Precedent requires judges to examine prior judicial decisions, examine the ratio decidendi in order to determine whether the ratio is binding or distinguishable and, if binding, whether the precedent must be followed or departed from (see M. Rowe and L. Katz, “A Practical Guide to Stare Decisis” (2020), 41 Windsor Rev. Legal Soc. Issues 1, at pp. 8-12; D. Parkes, “Precedent Unbound? Contemporary Approaches to Precedent in Canada” (2006), 32 Man. L.J. 135, at p. 141; see also R. v. Nur, 2015 SCC 15, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 773, at para. 71). Adherence to precedent furthers basic rule of law values such as consistency, certainty, fairness, predictability, and sound judicial administration (Saskatchewan Federation of Labour v. Saskatchewan, 2015 SCC 4, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 245, at para. 137; David Polowin Real Estate Ltd. v. Dominion of Canada General Insurance Co. (2005), 2005 CanLII 21093 (ON CA), 76 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.), at paras. 118‑21). It helps ensure judges decide cases based on shared and general norms, rather than personal predilection or intuition (J. Waldron, “Stare Decisis and the Rule of Law: A Layered Approach” (2012), 111 Mich. L. Rev. 1, at pp. 22‑23). The rule of law itself has constitutional status, recognized in the preamble of the Charter. It “lie[s] at the root of [Canada’s] system of government” (Reference re Secession of Quebec, at paras. 32 and 70).

[65]                        Horizontal stare decisis applies to courts of coordinate jurisdiction within a province, and applies to a ruling on the constitutionality of legislation as it does to any other legal issue decided by a court, if the ruling is binding. While not strictly binding in the same way as vertical stare decisis, decisions of the same court should be followed as a matter of judicial comity, as well as for the reasons supporting stare decisis generally (Parkes, at p. 158). A constitutional ruling by any court will, of course, bind lower courts through vertical stare decisis.

[66]                        Stare decisis brings important benefits to constitutional adjudication that balance predictability and consistency with changing social circumstances and the need for correctness. As Robert J. Sharpe has observed, an incorrect constitutional decision by a court is more difficult to repair and may require legislative intervention (Good Judgment: Making Judicial Decisions (2018)). It would be unwise for a single trial judge in a province to bind all other trial judges. It is better to revisit precedent than to allow it to perpetuate an injustice (Sharpe, at pp. 165‑68). Were s. 52(1) declarations strictly binding for all future cases, none of these benefits would be realized and our constitutional law would ossify. It is for these reasons that McLachlin C.J. asserted that “stare decisis is not a straitjacket that condemns the law to stasis” (Carter v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 5, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 331, at para. 44). Horizontal stare decisis attempts to balance stability and predictability against correctness and the orderly development of the law.

[67]                        In the absence of the supporting theory of stare decisis, res judicata on its own is not a helpful lens through which to analyse s. 52(1) declarations. Res judicata estops relitigation of disputed facts and disputed mixed questions of fact and law (B. Garner et al., The Law of Judicial Precedent (2016), at p. 374). The formal requirements of the two main branches of res judicata, cause of action and issue estoppel, will not be met in cases relitigating the constitutionality of a provision, for the simple reason that the parties will not be the same and neither will the facts. I acknowledge that courts also have inherent ability to prevent an abuse of process, which prevents relitigation of an issue where the strict test for res judicata is not met, in order to “[preserve] the integrity of the court’s process” (Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79, 2003 SCC 63, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 77, at para. 42).

[68]                        Stare decisis is the better framework to apply to litigation of constitutional issues, as it better guards against the relitigation of law, whereas res judicata guards against the relitigation of facts. First, abuse of process is not confined within a province and applying it to relitigation of the constitutionality of legislation would require a court to consider whether the parties are estopped from arguing the issue because a court in another jurisdiction has already decided on it. Even more remarkably, applying abuse of process to these types of cases would require a court of appeal to consider whether it should hear an appeal where a trial court in another province has already ruled on the constitutionality of an issue. Second, stare decisis and the test from Spruce Mills serve as a better guide for trial judges to determine whether to depart from horizontal precedent. At its core, this question relates to the rule of law and judicial comity. Applying abuse of process would unnecessarily confuse this analysis. Finally, courts must adjudicate constitutional issues — applying abuse of process or res judicata would prevent a court from even considering new constitutional arguments or issues. This would be unwise and would undermine constitutional supremacy. It would also prevent the courts from adapting to changing social circumstances, a fundamental feature of our constitutional order.

[69]                        Lastly, I note that some have been critical of the fact that the constitutional status of s. 33.1 has remained unsettled before trial courts across the country more than twenty years after its enactment by reason, in part, of a lack of appeals by the prosecution. Section 33.1 was declared unconstitutional by several trial courts in different provinces and upheld in others over this period. Notwithstanding declarations of unconstitutionality by trial courts, the Crown continued to rely on the provision in subsequent cases. One intervener before us suggested that the Crown must appeal declarations of unconstitutionality at the first opportunity or accept the lower court’s conclusion for all future cases. In the legal literature, some have said that it is unacceptable, in respect of federal legislation, for a provision to be unconstitutional in one province and not in another, or for a law to be applied inconsistently within a province because its constitutionality remains unsettled.

[70]                        While one might well expect the authorities to consider an appeal when faced with conflicting trial decisions relating to a law on which the prosecution continues to rely, I respectfully disagree with the view that the relevant attorney general is bound to appeal declarations of unconstitutionality in criminal matters such as these. It is true that when put on notice that the constitutionality of a provision has been challenged, the attorney general has the “opportunity” to defend the impugned law and appeal a declaration of unconstitutionality where an appeal does lie (Guindon v. Canada, 2015 SCC 41, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 19; see also R. v. McCann, 2015 ONCA 451, at para. 6 (CanLII)). Yet however desirable uniform treatment of the substantive criminal law might be within or even across provinces, the decision to appeal remains within the discretion of the attorney general, who acts independently in deciding the question, in keeping with its authority to pursue the public interest (see, e.g., M. Rosenberg, “The Attorney General and the Administration of Criminal Justice” (2009), 34 Queen’s L.J. 813, at pp. 819 and 825; K. Roach, “Not Just the Government’s Lawyer: The Attorney General as Defender of the Rule of Law” (2006), 31 Queen’s L.J. 598, at pp. 608‑10, citing J. Ll. J. Edwards, The Law Officers of the Crown (1964), at p. 228). 

[71]                        Barring an abuse of that authority, the attorney general is not answerable for the exercise of its discretion in such matters before the courts (R. v. Anderson, 2014 SCC 41, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 167, at paras. 44 and 46). The attorney general might well choose not to appeal a declaration of unconstitutionality, for example, if it felt that the matter is insufficiently developed in the decided cases for proper consideration by an appeal court or that a conviction would best be left alone. For example, there was no appeal from the constitutional ruling in Dunn notwithstanding an appeal from sentence (see, e.g., R. v. Dunn (2002), 2002 CanLII 53265 (ON CA), 156 O.A.C. 27 (C.A.); see also R. v. Jensen (2005), 2005 CanLII 7649 (ON CA), 74 O.R. (3d) 561 (C.A.)). That said, unsettled constitutional law, “and the uncertainty and unpredictability that [can] result”, may of course be a matter of serious consequence (Ferguson, at para. 72, cited in Nur, at para. 91).

[72]                        Before us, it was argued that the peculiar circumstances of this case highlight that the constitutional status of s. 33.1 remained unsettled for a significant period of time. It is not, of course, the role of this Court to instruct the Attorney General of Canada in the exercise of its prosecutorial discretion or the other tools it has at its disposal in the exercise of its charge. I do note that the Attorney General of Canada itself has written that “the Attorney General may conclude that it is in the public interest to appeal a Charter decision to the Supreme Court of Canada in order to allow for a pan-Canadian determination of the legislation’s constitutionality, as well as a pan-Canadian interpretation of the relevant Charter right” (Department of Justice Canada, Principles Guiding the Attorney General of Canada in Charter Litigation (2017), at p. 10). In making these comments, I acknowledge the constitutional and practical constraints on the office of the attorney general in the pursuit of its role as the “protector of the public interest” in the proper functioning of the criminal justice system (see, e.g., R. v. Cawthorne, 2016 SCC 32, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 983, at para. 27‑28; R. v. Power, 1994 CanLII 126 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601, at p. 616).

(4)         Proper Approach to Horizontal Stare Decisis

[73]                        Horizontal stare decisis applies to decisions of the same level of court. The framework that guides the application of horizontal stare decisis for superior courts at first instance is found in Spruce Mills, described by Wilson J. as follows (at p. 592):

. . . I will only go against a judgment of another Judge of this Court if:

(a) Subsequent decisions have affected the validity of the impugned judgment;

(b) it is demonstrated that some binding authority in case law, or some relevant statute was not considered;

(c) the judgment was unconsidered, a nisi prius judgment given in circumstances familiar to all trial Judges, where the exigencies of the trial require an immediate decision without opportunity to fully consult authority.

[74]                        The Spruce Mills criteria have been followed in numerous cases across Canada. However, the analytical framework has, at times, been blurred and the criteria have occasionally been of difficult application. Varying standards have been invoked to define when departure from prior precedent is appropriate. For example, some have held that a prior decision can be ignored if it is “plainly wrong” (R. v. Green, 2021 ONSC 2826, at paras. 9 and 24 (CanLII)), when there is “good reason” for doing so (R. v. Kehler, 2009 MBPC 29, 242 Man. R. (2d) 4, at para. 42), or in “extraordinary circumstances” (R. v. Wolverine and Bernard (1987), 1987 CanLII 4603 (SK KB), 59 Sask. R. 22 (Q.B.), at para. 6). The standards of “plainly wrong”, “good reason”, and “extraordinary circumstances” are qualitative tags susceptible of extending to almost any circumstance and do not provide the same precise guidance that Spruce Mills does (see S. Kerwin, “Stare Decisis in the B.C. Supreme Court: Revisiting Hansard Spruce Mills” (2004), 62 Advocate 541, at p. 543, fn. 33). These terms should no longer be used. In particular, the phrase “plainly wrong” is a subjective term and suggests that a judge may depart from binding precedent if they disagree with it — mere personal disagreement between two judges is not a sufficient basis to depart from binding precedent. The institutional consistency and predictability rationales of stare decisis are undermined by standards that enable difference in a single judge’s opinion to determine whether precedent should be followed. It is also not the case that a court can decide a question of law afresh where there are conflicting decisions.

[75]                        The principle of judicial comity — that judges treat fellow judges’ decisions with courtesy and consideration — as well as the rule of law principles supporting stare decisis mean that prior decisions should be followed unless the Spruce Mills criteria are met. Correctly stated and applied, the Spruce Mills criteria strike the appropriate balance between the competing demands of certainty, correctness and the even-handed development of the law. Trial courts should only depart from binding decisions issued by a court of coordinate jurisdiction in three narrow circumstances:

1.   The rationale of an earlier decision has been undermined by subsequent appellate decisions;

2.   The earlier decision was reached per incuriam (“through carelessness” or “by inadvertence”); or

3.   The earlier decision was not fully considered, e.g. taken in exigent circumstances.

[76]                        First, a judge need not follow a prior decision where the authority of the prior decision has been undermined by subsequent decisions. This may arise in a situation where a decision has been overruled by, or is necessarily inconsistent with, a decision by a higher court (see Rowe and Katz, at p. 18, citing Kerwin, at p. 542).

[77]                        Second, a judge can depart from a decision where it was reached without considering a relevant statute or binding authority. In other words, the decision was made per incuriam, or by inadvertence, a circumstance generally understood to be “rare” (see, e.g., The Owners, Strata Plan BCS 4006 v. Jameson House Ventures Ltd., 2017 BCSC 1988, 4 B.C.L.R. (6th) 370, at para. 132). The standard to find a decision per incuriam is well-known: the court failed to consider some authority such that, had it done so, it would have come to a different decision because the inadvertence is shown to have struck at the essence of the decision. It cannot merely be an instance in which an authority was not mentioned in the reasons; it must be shown that the missing authority affected the judgment (Rowe and Katz, at p. 19).

[78]                        Third and finally, a judge may depart where the exigencies of the trial required an immediate decision without the opportunity to consult authority fully and thus the decision was not fully considered. An unconsidered judgment is not binding on other judges (Rowe and Katz, at p. 18, citing Spruce Mills, at p. 592).

[79]                        These criteria define when a superior court at first instance may depart from binding judgment issued by a court of coordinate jurisdiction and apply equally to a prior ruling on the constitutionality of legislation. Where, as here, a judge is faced with conflicting authority on the constitutionality of legislation, the judge must follow the most recent authority unless the criteria above are met. In such a situation, the judge must, in determining whether the prior decision was taken per incuriam, consider whether the analysis failed to consider a binding authority or statute relevant to the legal question.

[80]                        To be plain: these criteria do not detract from the narrow circumstances outlined in Bedford, at paras. 42‑45, describing when a lower court may depart from binding vertical precedent.

[81]                        I will now turn to whether it was appropriate for the trial judge in Mr. Chan’s case to depart from Dunn and decide the constitutionality of s. 33.1 afresh.

[82]                        Application of the doctrine of horizontal stare decisis in Mr. Chan’s case illustrates how the Spruce Mills criteria should work in practice. At the time of Boswell J.’s constitutional ruling, there were four known decisions from the Ontario Superior Court, three of which held that s. 33.1 was unconstitutional. The most recent of these was Fleming. Fleming relied wholly on Dunn and, as a result, it is most appropriate to apply the Spruce Mills criteria to Dunn.

[83]                        Boswell J. cited the correct principles from Spruce Mills but, respectfully, erred in applying them. First, he concluded that he “[did] not feel constrained to follow one school of thought more than the other” because trial courts across the country had expressed different views on the constitutionality of s. 33.1 (para. 58). The conventions of horizontal stare decisis apply within the province and so the trial judge was required to consider the Spruce Mills criteria with specific reference to previous rulings within Ontario. The presence of conflicting decisions is not a reason to sidestep the Spruce Mills analysis. Second, in the Application to Re-open the Constitutional Challenge, he concluded that McCaw — which held that it was bound by Dunn — was “plainly wrong” (paras. 14 and 34). The “plainly wrong” standard no longer adequately summarizes the whole of the applicable Spruce Mills criteria.

[84]                        Instead, Boswell J. should have looked to the substance of Dunn to determine whether it had been overruled by a higher court, had been decided per incuriam, or had been taken in exigent circumstances. That would have revealed that Dunn did not engage whatsoever with the earlier Ontario decision in R. v. Decaire, [1998] O.J. No. 6339 (QL) (C.J. (Gen. Div.)), that upheld the constitutionality of s. 33.1. Since Dunn did not apply the Spruce Mills criteria to determine whether it was permissible to depart from Decaire, Dunn was a decision per incuriam and did not need to be followed. The trial judge should have then reviewed the substance of Decaire to determine whether that decision should be followed based on the Spruce Mills criteria. That would have revealed that Decaire considered the appropriate statutes and authorities in reaching the conclusion that s. 33.1 infringed ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter but was upheld under s. 1. There is also no indication that Decaire was rendered in exigent circumstances. The trial judge therefore should have followed Decaire in the constitutional ruling. Of course, on appeal, the Court of Appeal was not bound to follow Decaire or any other first instance superior court decision.

[85]                        Finally, it bears recalling that McCaw was decided shortly after the constitutional ruling in Mr. Chan’s case. The court in McCaw did not have the benefit of Boswell J.’s reasons in Mr. Chan’s case for upholding s. 33.1, as the pre-trial constitutional decision had not yet been published while awaiting possible jury deliberations (Application to Re‑Open Constitutional Challenge, at para. 9). In circumstances such as this, where a court had no practical way of knowing that the earlier decision existed, the judgment will not bind a subsequent court, unless it has been brought to the court’s attention or the court is otherwise aware of it (see Kerwin, at p. 551).

[86]                        To summarize, a court is required by the principles of judicial comity and horizontal stare decisis to follow a binding prior decision of the same court in the province. A decision may not be binding if it is distinguishable on its facts or the court has no practical way of knowing it existed. If it is binding, a trial court may only depart if one or more of the Spruce Mills exceptions apply.

[87]                        I will now turn to Mr. Chan’s cross‑appeal.

B.            Is There Jurisdiction to Hear Mr. Chan’s Cross‑Appeal?

[88]                          Mr. Chan argued in his application for leave to cross-appeal that s. 695 of the Criminal Code provides this Court with the jurisdiction to hear his cross‑appeal, which allows it to make any order that a court of appeal “might have made”. He points to R. v. J.F., 2008 SCC 60, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 215, where this Court granted leave to an accused’s cross‑appeal and entered an acquittal in place of a new trial. I disagree. In my view, his application for leave to cross‑appeal should be quashed for want of jurisdiction.

[89]                          Sections 691 and 692 of the Criminal Code set out the jurisdiction of this Court to hear criminal appeals brought by criminal accused. An accused may appeal where their conviction for an indictable offence has been confirmed by the Court of Appeal (s. 691(1)) or where acquittal at trial has been set aside by the Court of Appeal (s. 691(2)). Sections 691(1) and (2), along with s. 692 (which has no bearing on this case), represent the whole of an accused’s express statutory right to appeal when their conviction has been affirmed or their acquittal set aside by a Court of Appeal. In circumstances like those of Mr. Chan, where an accused, having been convicted of an indictable offence at trial, is granted a new trial, s. 691 does not provide a route of appeal to this Court.

[90]                          There is no other statutory route for Mr. Chan to appeal the Court of Appeal’s order of a new trial. Section 40(1) of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26, which does give this Court jurisdiction to hear an appeal of a final order of a Court of Appeal, cannot ground jurisdiction for a cross‑appeal by Mr. Chan because s. 40(3) precludes it:

(3) No appeal to the Court lies under this section from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or, except in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an offence other than an indictable offence.

In other words, where a person is convicted of an indictable offence but subsequently has that conviction set aside, there is no right of appeal to this Court under s. 40 (see R. v. Hinse, 1995 CanLII 54 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 597, at para. 18). The combined effect of s. 40(3) and ss. 691 and 692 “excludes many criminal appeals from the ambit of s. 40(1)” (R. v. Shea, 2010 SCC 26, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 17, at para. 3, per Cromwell J.).

[91]                        Respectfully, J.F. does not assist Mr. Chan. The parties in J.F. did not make submissions on whether the accused in that case had jurisdiction to cross‑appeal. Where a case is heard but jurisdiction is not discussed, the case is not an authority that the Court has jurisdiction (Saumur v. Recorder’s Court (Quebec), 1947 CanLII 31 (SCC), [1947] S.C.R. 492, at pp. 497‑98). It is well understood that this Court’s jurisdiction is statutory — a prior decision of this Court which did not address jurisdiction cannot displace clear statutory language (Kourtessis v. M.N.R., 1993 CanLII 137 (SCC), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 53).

[92]                        During oral argument, counsel for Mr. Chan also referred the Court to R. v. Warsing, 1998 CanLII 775 (SCC), [1998] 3 S.C.R. 579. In that case, the Court held that the British Columbia Court of Appeal did not have jurisdiction to order a limited new trial on the issue of not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder because it would have restricted the accused’s right to control his defence. This Court ordered a full new trial instead. Warsing is distinguishable here because it did not substitute an order for a new trial for an acquittal — it maintained the same order but varied the scope of the new trial. On the specific question of whether this Court has jurisdiction to hear a cross-appeal, Warsing is also distinguishable on the basis that no cross-appeal was filed. It was appropriate for the Court to rely on s. 695(1) in that case because it had jurisdiction to hear the appeal and it was merely varying the order which the Court of Appeal ought to have made. As s. 695(1) provides, this Court “may, on an appeal under this Part, make any order that the court of appeal might have made and may make any rule or order that is necessary to give effect to its judgment”.

C.            Disposition of the Appeals

(1)         Mr. Chan

[93]                        Given the lack of jurisdiction to substitute an acquittal, it would be unwise to comment further on the substance of Mr. Chan’s application to cross‑appeal. Since this Court has held that s. 33.1 is unconstitutional and of no force or effect in Brown, Mr. Chan may avail himself of the defence of non-mental disorder automatism, should it be applicable on the facts. He will have the opportunity to lead evidence in that regard.

[94]                        Counsel for Mr. Chan submitted in oral argument that a stay of proceedings is warranted if there is no jurisdiction to hear the cross-appeal (transcript, at p. 154). If a retrial occurs, Mr. Chan argued, the Crown will very likely take the position that Mr. Chan is not criminally responsible by reason of a mental disorder — a position the prosecution forcefully opposed at his first trial. The evidence he led at his first trial to support the finding that he was not criminally responsible under s. 16, including highly personal evidence of his concussions, learning disabilities, and depression, would be used against him in his retrial. He argues that it is fundamentally unfair.

[95]                        Assuming without deciding that a stay could be ordered in such circumstances, I would decline to do so here. There is an insufficient record before the Court to order a stay of proceedings. I am unable to conclude, based on the nature of the proceedings below, that a stay is warranted. I hasten to add that a future trial judge may find otherwise if the evidence put forward and the nature of the proceedings warrant. A stay of proceedings may only be granted in the “clearest of cases”, where prejudice to an accused’s rights or to the judicial system is irreparable and cannot be remedied (R. v. Carosella, 1997 CanLII 402 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 80, at para. 52; R. v. Babos, 2014 SCC 16, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 309, at para. 31, both quoting R. v. O’Connor, 1995 CanLII 51 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, at paras. 68 and 82). The test for a stay has three components: 1) there must be prejudice to an accused’s fair trial right or to the integrity of the justice system that will be perpetuated or aggravated through a trial or its outcome; 2) there must be no alternative remedy capable of remedying the prejudice; 3) where it is unclear whether a stay is warranted after the first two steps, the court must balance the interests in favour of a stay against the interest that society has in having a final decision on the merits (Babos, at para. 32).

[96]                        Mr. Chan’s arguments with respect to the prejudice he might suffer relate to a future trial, not the proceedings below. I am unable to conclude, on the record before the Court, that Mr. Chan’s right to a fair trial has been prejudiced. A trial judge is best positioned to determine whether such prejudice arises in the future and, if it does, what the appropriate remedy may be (O’Connor, at paras. 68 and 82). For example, a trial judge would be capable of excluding evidence if the Crown sought to marshal it in a prejudicial manner.

[97]                        I add that it remains an open question whether it would be in the public interest to proceed with Mr. Chan’s prosecution again, or whether there is a reasonable prospect of conviction. This case is, to use the words of the trial judge, a tragic case with a tragic result. It is also true that Mr. Chan has been charged with serious violent crimes. The final decision on how to proceed rests with the Crown and in my view, this Court is not best placed to consider the matter further.

(2)         Mr. Sullivan

[98]                        The trial judge found that Mr. Sullivan was acting involuntarily when he attacked his mother. The common law compels an acquittal in such an instance. He was nevertheless found guilty, due to the operation of s. 33.1. The Court of Appeal declared that s. 33.1 is of no force or effect, set aside the conviction, and substituted an acquittal. As I concluded in Brown, the Court of Appeal was correct that s. 33.1 is unconstitutional. Mr. Sullivan established at trial that he was intoxicated to the point of automatism owing to his Wellbutrin overdose. Given that s. 33.1 is of no force or effect, I would confirm the conclusion of the Court of Appeal that Mr. Sullivan is entitled to acquittals.

VI.         Conclusion

[99]                        I would dismiss the appeals. The application for leave to cross-appeal by Mr. Chan should be quashed for want of jurisdiction. In the result, I would confirm Mr. Sullivan’s acquittals and the order of a new trial for Mr. Chan.

 

                    Appeals dismissed and application for leave to cross‑appeal quashed.
                    
                    
2022 SCC 20

JUDGMENT

 

The appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, Number CACR3347, 2021 SKCA 118, dated September 1, 2021, was heard on May 16, 2022, and the Court on that day delivered the following judgment orally:

 

 

 

Moldaver J. — A majority of the Court would dismiss the appeal, substantially for the reasons of the majority of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal. Justices Karakatsanis and Martin would allow the appeal, substantially for the reasons of the dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal.


2022 SCC 21

JUDGMENT

 

The appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, Number C66305, 2021 ONCA 207, dated April 1, 2021, was heard on May 18, 2022, and the Court on that day delivered the following judgment orally:

 

 

Brown J. — The appellant, Syed Adeel Safdar, was tried for offences related to the abuse of his wife. At the conclusion of evidence and submissions, he applied for a stay based on a breach of his right under s. 11(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to be tried within a reasonable time. The trial judge heard the application while preparing his decision on the trial proper, then reserved that decision and granted the stay. In his reasons for ordering a stay, he also advised that he had completed his reserved trial decision, which remained under seal pending the outcome of any appeal from his stay order.

 

 

 

The Crown appealed the stay order, arguing that, on the authority of this Court’s decision in R. v. K.G.K., 2020 SCC 7 (which was not available to the trial judge), the trial judge had erred by including as part of the total delay the period from the end of the evidence and argument to the release of the stay decision. Absent that error, the total delay fell under 30 months. The Court of Appeal for Ontario agreed, set aside the stay order and referred the matter back to the trial judge to release his decision on the trial proper. Mr. Safdar now appeals the Court of Appeal’s decision to this Court.

 

 

We agree with the Court of Appeal that K.G.K. is dispositive of the central issue in this appeal. For the purposes of determining whether the total delay exceeded the Jordan presumptive ceiling, the time between the conclusion of evidence and argument, and the bringing of the s. 11(b) application in this case, should not have been counted (K.G.K., at paras. 31 and 33; R. v. J.F., 2022 SCC 17, at para. 27).

 

 

Nor, in our view, and despite Mr. Hasan’s able submissions before us, has Mr. Safdar established that the total delay of 29.25 months was markedly longer than reasonable delay in the broader context of the trial (K.G.K., at paras. 3, 23 and 54-55), taking into account the length of time taken for the application, the moderate complexity of the case, and other institutional factors that he raises (K.G.K., at paras. 65 and 68-72).

 

 

We also agree with the Court of Appeal’s disposition of the other issues raised by Mr. Safdar in this appeal, substantially for the reasons it gives.

 

 

The appeal is dismissed.

                    Karakatsanis J. —

I.               Overview

[1]                              An appeal is not a retrial. Nor is it licence for an appellate court to review the evidence afresh. When appellate courts stray beyond the proper bounds of review, finality and order in our system of justice is compromised. But not every trial decision can weather a dynamic and unpredictable future. Once it is rendered, lives go on and circumstances may change. When additional evidence is put forward, how should appellate courts reconcile the need for finality and order in our legal system with the need for decisions that reflect the just result in the proceedings before the court? And conversely, what framework should guide trial judges when they determine whether relocation is in a child’s best interests, to ensure a just result that can navigate what lies ahead? This appeal raises both questions.

[2]                              The Court must first determine the test that applies to the admission of additional evidence on appeal. The Court is asked to decide whether a legal distinction should be drawn between admitting “fresh evidence” (concerning events that occurred before trial) and “new evidence” (concerning events that occurred after trial).

[3]                              In my view, the test in Palmer v. The Queen, 1979 CanLII 8 (SCC), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, applies whenever a party seeks to adduce additional evidence on appeal for the purpose of reviewing the decision below, regardless of whether the evidence relates to facts that occurred before or after trial. Appellate courts must apply the Palmer criteria to determine whether finality and order in the administration of justice must yield in service of a just outcome. The overarching consideration is the interests of justice, regardless of when the evidence, or fact, came into existence.

[4]                              In cases where the best interests of the child are the primary concern, the Palmer test is sufficiently flexible to recognize that it may be in the interests of justice for a court to have more context before rendering decisions that could profoundly alter the course of a child’s life. At the same time, finality and order are critically important in family proceedings, and factual developments that occur subsequent to trial are usually better addressed through variation procedures.

[5]                              In this case, the Court of Appeal for British Columbia held that Palmer did not strictly govern the admission of new evidence on appeal. Instead, it applied a different test and admitted the evidence. It erred in doing so.

[6]                              In my view, the evidence did not satisfy the Palmer criteria. The respondent sought to overturn an unfavourable trial outcome by adducing evidence on appeal that could have been available at first instance, had he acted with due diligence. Effectively, he was allowed to remedy the deficiencies in his trial evidence on appeal — with the benefit, and guidance, of the trial reasons. This gave rise to considerable unfairness. And in any event, evidence in family law appeals that is tendered for the purpose of showing a material change of circumstances is more appropriately raised at a variation hearing. Palmer should not be used to circumvent a variation scheme that Parliament specifically designed to address such developments. Admission of this evidence on appeal was not in the interests of justice.

[7]                              The second broad issue in this case relates to the legal framework for determining whether it is in a child’s best interests to allow a parent to relocate with the child, away from the other parent. It concerns the application of Gordon v. Goertz, 1996 CanLII 191 (SCC), [1996] 2 S.C.R. 27, as refined by the case law over the past two decades and viewed in light of the recent amendments of the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.).

[8]                              Determining the best interests of the child is a heavy responsibility, with profound impacts on children, families and society. In many cases, the answer is difficult — the court must choose between competing and often compelling visions of how to best advance the needs and interests of the child. The challenge is even greater in mobility cases. Geographic distance reduces flexibility, disrupts established patterns, and inevitably impacts the relationship between a parent and a child. The forward-looking nature of relocation cases requires judges to craft a disposition at a fixed point in time that is both sensitive to that child’s present circumstances and can withstand the test of time and adversity.

[9]                              The law relating to the best interests of the child has long emphasized the need for individualized and discretionary decision making. But children also need predictability and certainty. To balance these competing interests, the law provides a framework and factors to structure a judge’s discretion. This case calls on the Court to examine how some of those considerations apply in mobility cases. In particular, I clarify that a moving parent’s reasons for relocation and the “maximum contact factor” are relevant only to the extent they bear upon the best interests of the child; a parent’s testimony about whether they will move regardless of the outcome of the relocation application should not be considered; and family violence is a significant factor impacting the best interests of the child.

[10]                          Here, the trial judge did not err in his conclusion that relocation was in the best interests of the children. His factual findings and the weight he ascribed to factors bearing on the children’s best interests warranted deference on appeal. In the absence of any reviewable error, the Court of Appeal was wrong to intervene.

[11]                          At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court (Côté J. dissenting in part) allowed the appeal and restored the trial judge’s order, for reasons to follow. These are the reasons.

II.            Background

[12]                          Ashley Barendregt, the mother, met Geoff Grebliunas, the father, in 2011 in the Bulkley Valley, in northern British Columbia. She followed him to Kelowna in 2012, where he had moved for a change of scenery. Soon after, they got married. They bought a house and had two boys, who were aged three and five at the time of trial in 2019. They shared parenting duties throughout the marriage.

[13]                        The home purchase, already a burden on their modest finances, proved to be a project. An electrical fire shortly after they moved in exposed underlying problems — “rodents, water ingress, mould, and compromise of a structural floor joist” (2019 BCSC 2192, 34 R.F.L. (8th) 331, at para. 6) — that the father, with his background in carpentry, pledged to repair. He tore out drywall, planning to proceed room by room. But progress was slow. By trial, six years later, the house remained an “ongoing construction project” (trial reasons, at para. 5), with a makeshift kitchen and an only recently completed upstairs bathroom. The father’s own expert witness described it as “a working environment, not a living environment”: para. 33. Significant money was needed to bring it to marketable condition — funds the couple lacked, being well into six figures of debt by trial.

[14]                          Their relationship ended in November 2018, when the father “likely” assaulted the mother during an argument. That night, she drove the 2 boys some 10 hours to her parents’ home in Telkwa, a village in the Bulkley Valley. The parenting arrangement that emerged in the aftermath was formalized in an interim order, splitting parenting time between the parents, alternately in Telkwa and Kelowna, before they agreed to keep the children in Kelowna with the father. When the mother returned to Kelowna, they were to alternate weekly parenting time. But she did not return. A court order gave her parenting time with the boys in Telkwa in August 2019, but she had no further parenting time before the trial, which was held later that year.

[15]                          The central issue at trial was whether the children should be relocated to Telkwa with the mother or remain in Kelowna. She was willing to move to Kelowna if the father prevailed; he was unwilling to move to the Bulkley Valley under any circumstances.

[16]                          After a nine-day trial, the judge awarded primary residence of the children to the mother and allowed them to relocate to Telkwa. The father appealed and sought to adduce additional evidence. The Court of Appeal admitted the evidence, set aside the trial decision, and ordered the children to be returned to Kelowna. That decision was stayed pending appeal to this Court.

III.         Decisions Below

A.           Supreme Court of British Columbia, 2019 BCSC 2192, 34 R.F.L. (8th) 331 (Saunders J.)

[17]                          The trial judge found that both parents played active parts in raising the children, and relocation to Telkwa would have a significant impact on the children’s relationship with their father. Two key issues, however, favoured the move.

[18]                          The more significant issue was the parties’ acrimonious relationship and its implications for the children. He doubted they could collaborate to promote the children’s best interests. Their marriage had involved “possibly some degree of emotional abuse”; the father had assaulted and emotionally traumatized the mother; and his conduct at trial was “abusive, and profoundly offensive”: para. 41. There was, he found, “compelling evidence of [the father’s] continuing animosity towards [the mother]”: para. 42.

[19]                          He concluded that granting the mother primary care of the children would be in their best interests. She was more likely than the father to promote a positive attitude in the boys toward the other parent, and distancing the parents would help isolate the children from their discord. It was also unlikely that the parents could work cooperatively to promote the children’s best interests in a shared parenting structure in the near future. The children would furthermore benefit indirectly from the mother living in Telkwa, where she had a stronger support network.

[20]                          The “less significant” issue was the parties’ financial situation: para. 31. The house needed an influx of money to make it habitable. The father said he would accelerate the renovations but had not prepared a budget for the ongoing work. His plan to live in the house with the boys depended on his parents paying off the mortgage and line of credit, an arrangement they had yet to confirm by trial. The judge concluded that the father’s ability to remain in the house, or even in West Kelowna, was less than certain.

[21]                          The trial judge concluded that relocation would best promote the children’s interests. He awarded the mother primary residence and granted her application.

B.            Court of Appeal for British Columbia, 2021 BCCA 11, 45 B.C.L.R. (6th) 14 (Newbury, DeWitt-Van Oosten and Voith JJ.A.)

[22]                          The appeal proceeded, and the hearing had nearly ended, when the father’s counsel informed the court that her client’s financial situation had suddenly changed. The father later elaborated in an affidavit: he had taken steps to purchase the mother’s interest in the property; his parents had purchased a half interest in the home and had increased their personal line of credit to finance renovations; the three of them had refinanced the home, nearly halving the monthly mortgage payments; he had completed the bathroom and master bedroom; and a contractor had been hired to finish the kitchen. He sought to admit evidence of all of these developments in the appeal.

[23]                          Voith J.A., for the court, characterized this as “new” evidence because it had not existed at the time of trial. As such, it was not subject to the Palmer test, and the due diligence criterion did not strictly govern its admission. Instead, “new evidence” could be admitted if it established “that a premise or underpinning or understanding of the trial judge that was significant or fundamental or pivotal has been undermined or altered”: para. 43.

[24]                          The court admitted the evidence, finding that it undermined a primary underpinning of the trial decision, namely, the judge’s findings on the parties’ finances. Specifically, the father had done almost exactly what he had said he would; and the “assumption[s]” that he might not be able to remain in the family home and might not “possibly even [be] able to remain in West Kelowna” had been displaced: para. 57. One of trial judge’s two main considerations no longer applied.

[25]                          And given this, the other consideration — the parties’ acrimonious relationship — could “no longer support the ultimate result arrived at by the trial judge”: para. 69. The mother’s need for emotional support could not justify relocation, even at the cost of “some friction between the parties”: paras. 74-75. And the trial judge should have considered whether the children could have stayed with their father in Kelowna. The court concluded that the children’s best interests were best served by staying in Kelowna with both parents and ordered accordingly.

IV.         Issues

[26]                    This appeal raises two broad issues:

(i)                     What test governs the admission of additional evidence on appeal, and did the Court of Appeal err in admitting the evidence in this case?

(ii)                 Did the trial judge err in his relocation analysis, warranting appellate intervention?

[27]                          In brief, I answer as follows. Regardless of whether the evidence relates to facts that occurred before or after trial, the Palmer test governs the admission of additional evidence on appeal when it is adduced for the purpose of reviewing the decision below. The Court of Appeal erred by applying a different test and admitting the evidence on appeal. The evidence did not satisfy the Palmer test because it could have been available for trial with the exercise of due diligence. In any event, given the availability of a variation procedure designed to address any material change in circumstances, its admission was not in the interests of justice.

[28]                          Moreover, the trial judge did not err in his relocation analysis. His analysis of the best interests of the children is consonant with the mobility framework set out in Gordon as refined over the past two decades. His factual findings and the weight he ascribed to factors bearing on the children’s best interests warranted deference on appeal. The Court of Appeal was wrong to intervene.

V.           Analysis

A.           The Test for Admitting Additional Evidence on Appeal

[29]                        Appellate courts have the discretion to admit additional evidence to supplement the record on appeal: Catholic Children’s Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto v. M. (C.), 1994 CanLII 83 (SCC), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 165, at p. 188; United States of America v. Shulman, 2001 SCC 21, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 616, at para. 43. Whether in criminal or non-criminal matters (May v. Ferndale Institution, 2005 SCC 82, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 809, at para. 107), courts have typically applied the four criteria set out by this Court in Palmer when parties seek to adduce evidence on appeal:

(i)                          the evidence could not, by the exercise of due diligence, have been obtained for the trial (provided that this general principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases);

(ii)                       the evidence is relevant in that it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue;

(iii)                     the evidence is credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief; and

(iv)                       the evidence is such that, if believed, it could have affected the result at trial.

[30]                          Palmer applies when evidence is adduced on appeal “for the purpose of asking the court to review the proceedings in the court below”: Shulman, at para. 44. Palmer does not, however, apply to evidence going to the validity of the trial process itself (R. v. Taillefer, 2003 SCC 70, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 307, at paras. 76‑77), nor to evidence adduced “as a basis for requesting an original remedy in the Court of Appeal”, such as a stay of proceedings for an abuse of process (Shulman, at paras. 44‑46).

[31]                        The Palmer test is purposive, fact-specific, and driven by an overarching concern for the interests of justice. It ensures that the admission of additional evidence on appeal will be rare, such that the matters in issue between the parties should “narrow rather than expand as [a] case proceeds up the appellate ladder”: Public School Boards’ Assn. of Alberta v. Alberta (Attorney General), 2000 SCC 2, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 44, at para. 10.

[32]                          The test strikes a balance between two foundational principles: (i) finality and order in the justice system, and (ii) reaching a just result in the context of the proceedings. The first criterion seeks to preserve finality and order by excluding evidence that could have been considered by the court at first instance, had the party exercised due diligence. This protects certainty in the judicial process and fairness to the other party. The remaining criteria — that the evidence be relevant, credible and could have affected the outcome — are concerned with reaching a just result.

[33]                          While the interest in the finality of a trial decision and order in the justice system must sometimes give way to reach a just result, as I will explain, a proper application of Palmer reflects and safeguards both principles, as well as fairness to the parties.

[34]                          For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the Palmer test applies to all evidence tendered on appeal for the purpose of reviewing the decision below. In my view, the Palmer test ensures the proper balance and is sufficiently flexible to respond to any unique concerns that arise when considering whether to admit evidence regarding facts or events that occurred after the trial.

[35]                          My analysis proceeds as follows. First, I discuss the four Palmer criteria. Second, I address the unique challenges that arise when litigants seek to adduce “new” evidence. Third, I consider how Palmer applies in the family law context. Finally, I address the use of properly admitted evidence, before turning to the merits of the fresh evidence motion in this case.

(1)         The Palmer Criteria

(a)           Due Diligence

[36]                        Functionally, the first Palmer criterion — that the evidence could not, by the exercise of due diligence, have been obtained for the trial — focuses on the conduct of the party seeking to adduce the evidence. It requires litigants to take all reasonable steps to present their best case at trial. This ensures finality and order in the judicial process: R. v. St-Cloud, 2015 SCC 27, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 328, at para. 130; R. v. G.D.B., 2000 SCC 22, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520, at para. 19; R. v. Angelillo, 2006 SCC 55, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 728, at para. 15.

[37]                        The relationship between due diligence, and finality and order are deeply rooted in our common law. The law generally “requires litigants to put their best foot forward to establish the truth of their allegations when first called upon to do so”: Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., 2001 SCC 44, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 460, at para. 18. This animates, for example, the cause of action estoppel doctrine, which safeguards “the interest of an individual in being protected from repeated suits and prosecutions for the same cause” and “the finality and conclusiveness of judicial decisions”: K. R. Handley, Spencer Bower and Handley: Res Judicata (4th ed. 2009), at pp. 3-4. This doctrine achieves these ends through a due diligence component: it precludes a party from bringing an action against another party where the basis of the cause of action was argued or could have been argued in the prior action if the party in question had exercised reasonable diligence (Grandview (Town of) v. Doering, 1975 CanLII 16 (SCC), [1976] 2 S.C.R. 621, at pp. 634-38, citing Henderson v. Henderson (1843), 3 Hare 100).

[38]                          The Palmer test’s due diligence criterion plays a similar role: it ensures that litigants put their best foot forward when first called upon to do so.

[39]                        The principle of finality and order has both individual and systemic dimensions in this setting. On an individual level, it speaks to the profound unfairness in providing “a party the opportunity to make up for deficiencies in [their] case at trial”: Stav v. Stav, 2012 BCCA 154, 31 B.C.L.R. (5th) 302, at para. 32. A party who has not acted with due diligence should not be afforded a “second kick at the can”: S.F.D. v. M.T., 2019 NBCA 62, 49 C.C.P.B. (2nd) 177, at para. 24. And the opposing party is entitled to certainty and generally should not have to relitigate an issue decided at first instance, absent a reviewable error. Otherwise, the opposing party must endure additional delay and expense to answer a new case on appeal. Permitting a party in an appeal to fill the gaps in their trial evidence based on the failings identified by the trial judge is fundamentally unfair to the other litigant in an adversarial proceeding.

[40]                          On a systemic level, this principle preserves the distinction between the roles of trial and appellate courts. Evaluating evidence and making factual findings are the responsibilities of trial judges. Appellate courts, by contrast, are designed to review trial decisions for errors. The admission of additional evidence on appeal blurs this critical distinction by permitting litigants to effectively extend trial proceedings into the appellate arena.

[41]                        By requiring litigants to call all evidence necessary to present their best case at first instance, the due diligence criterion protects this distinction. This, in turn, sustains the proper functioning of our judicial architecture (R. v. Sipos, 2014 SCC 47, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 423, at para. 30), and ensures the efficient and effective use of judicial resources (see Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 16).

[42]                          The importance of the due diligence criterion may vary, however, depending on the proposed use of the evidence. Evidence sought to be adduced as a basis for intervention — to demonstrate the first instance decision was wrong — raises greater concerns for finality and order than evidence that may help determine an appropriate order after the court has found a material error. Since appellate intervention is justified on the basis of a reviewable error in the decision below, there is less concern for finality and order. Accordingly, in such cases, the due diligence criterion has less bearing on the interests of justice.

[43]                          In sum, the due diligence criterion safeguards the importance of finality and order for the parties and the integrity of the judicial system. The focus at this stage of Palmer is on the conduct of the party. This is why evidence that could, by the exercise of due diligence, have been available for trial should generally not be admitted on appeal.

(b)         The Criteria That the Evidence Be Relevant, Credible and Could Have Affected the Result

[44]                        The last three Palmer criteria require courts to only admit evidence on appeal when it is relevant, credible, and could have affected the result at trial. Unlike the first criterion, which focuses on the conduct of the party, these three criteria focus on the evidence adduced. And unlike due diligence, the latter three criteria are “conditions precedent” — evidence that falls short of them cannot be admitted on appeal: R. v. Lévesque, 2000 SCC 47, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 487, at para. 14.

[45]                          These criteria reflect the other principle that animates the Palmer test: the importance of reaching a just result in the context of the proceedings (Sipos, at paras. 30‑31; R. v. Warsing, 1998 CanLII 775 (SCC), [1998] 3 S.C.R. 579, at para. 56). This principle is directly linked to the correctness of the trial decision and the truth-seeking function of our trial process. Evidence that is unreliable, not credible, or not probative of the issues in dispute may hinder, rather than facilitate, the search for the truth. And as Cory J. observed in R. v. Nikolovski, 1996 CanLII 158 (SCC), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1197, at para. 13, “[t]he ultimate aim of any trial, criminal or civil, must be to seek and to ascertain the truth.”

[46]                        After a court has decided to admit evidence on appeal, it should remain mindful that the evidence has not been put to the test of cross-examination or rebuttal at trial, and the adverse party may not have had the ability to verify its accuracy: Lévesque, at para. 25. If the evidence is challenged or its probative value is in dispute, appellate courts may, among other things, provide the opposing party an opportunity to respond, allow cross‑examination of a witness, permit the submission of expert evidence in response to additional expert evidence, or remit the matter to the court of first instance: Lévesque, at para. 25; see also Child and Family Services of Winnipeg v. J.M.F., 2000 MBCA 145, 153 Man. R. (2d) 90, at para. 27; Children’s Aid Society of Windsor-Essex (County) v. B. (Y.) (2004), 2004 CanLII 1782 (ON CA), 5 R.F.L. (6th) 269 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 12 and 19.

(c)           Palmer Resolves the Tension Between the Need for Finality and Order, and the Interest in Reaching a Just Result

[47]                          The Palmer test reconciles the tension between these two foundational principles — the need for finality and order, and the interest in reaching a just result — to determine the interests of justice in the circumstances of each case: Sipos, at para. 31. It is against this backdrop that I address whether the Palmer test applies to what has been called “new” evidence (more accurately referred to as evidence of facts or events that occurred after trial).

(2)         The Palmer Test Applies to Evidence of Facts that Arise After Trial

[48]                          The primary issue in this appeal is whether and how the Palmer test applies to “new” evidence. According to the Court of Appeal, evidence is “new” if it pertains to facts that occurred after trial; “fresh” evidence pertains to facts that occurred before trial, but which, for one reason or another, could not be put before the court.

[49]                          Appellate courts across the country have differed in their approaches to “new” evidence. Some have applied the Palmer criteria (J.W.S. v. C.J.S., 2019 ABCA 153, at para. 37 (CanLII); Sheikh (Re), 2019 ONCA 692, at para. 7 (CanLII); Riel v. Riel, 2017 SKCA 74, 99 R.F.L. (7th) 367, at para. 16; Hellberg v. Netherclift, 2017 BCCA 363, 2 B.C.L.R. (6th) 126, at paras. 53‑54), while others have applied a different or modified test (North Vancouver (District) v. Lunde (1998), 1998 CanLII 4205 (BC CA), 60 B.C.L.R. (3d) 201 (C.A.), at paras. 25‑26; Jens v. Jens, 2008 BCCA 392, 300 D.L.R. (4th) 136, at paras. 24‑29; Dickson v. Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation, 2021 YKCA 5, at paras. 159‑61 and 166 (CanLII); Miller v. White, 2018 PECA 11, 10 R.F.L. (8th) 251, at para. 19; Beauchamp v. Beauchamp, 2021 SKCA 148, at para. 36 (CanLII)).

[50]                          This dissonance in the jurisprudence reflects two apparent paradoxes that arise in applying the first and fourth Palmer criteria to “new” evidence. Courts have queried whether new evidence could ever fail the due diligence criterion, since it relates to facts not yet in existence at the time of trial: see Cory v. Marsh (1993), 1993 CanLII 1150 (BC CA), 77 B.C.L.R. (2d) 248 (C.A.), at paras. 21 and 28‑29; J.M.F., at para. 21. Others have asked how such evidence could possibly have affected a trial outcome that it postdated: North Vancouver (District), at para. 25; Radcliff v. Radcliff (2000), 2000 CanLII 3720 (ON CA), 7 R.F.L. (5th) 425 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 10; Sengmueller v. Sengmueller (1994), 1994 CanLII 8711 (ON CA), 17 O.R. (3d) 208 (C.A.), at p. 211.

[51]                          In the face of conflicting British Columbia case law, the Court of Appeal concluded that the Palmer test only applies to fresh evidence, and the due diligence criterion did not strictly govern the admission of new evidence. It outlined the following test:

     . . . depending on the circumstances, new evidence may be admitted if it establishes that a premise or underpinning or understanding of the trial judge that was significant or fundamental or pivotal has been undermined or altered. [para. 43]

[52]                          The mother takes issue with the Court of Appeal’s approach: she submits that the Palmer criteria apply to both fresh and new evidence. The father argues that the test applied below was appropriate because the new evidence “falsified” the trial decision.

[53]                          I conclude that the Court of Appeal erred by applying a different test to “new” evidence.

[54]                          Applying a different test for admitting new evidence — which dispensed with the due diligence criterion — failed to safeguard the delicate balance between finality and order, and the interest in a just result. It is also inconsistent with this Court’s Palmer jurisprudence. Indeed, this Court has consistently applied Palmer to evidence pertaining to events that occurred between the trial and appeal: see, for example, Catholic Children’s Aid Society, at p. 188; R. v. Owen, 2003 SCC 33, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 779, at paras. 50-51; Sipos, at paras. 29-30. The evidence in Palmer concerned facts that occurred both before and after trial and thus included both “fresh” and “new” evidence. The additional evidence included sworn declarations made by one of the key trial witnesses who recanted his testimony after trial, declaring that the RCMP promised him money before trial and made the payment after trial.

[55]                          The Palmer test is sufficiently flexible to deal with both types of evidence. As I will explain, the core inquiries under all four criteria remain the same regardless of when the evidence, or the specific fact, came into existence. Because the same test applies, it is unnecessary to distinguish between “fresh” and “new” evidence. Palmer applies to the admission of all additional evidence tendered on appeal for the purpose of reviewing the decision below.

(a)           The Due Diligence Criterion

[56]                          A common thread running through the parties’ submissions and the Court of Appeal’s decision is that conceptual difficulties arise when applying the due diligence criterion to evidence about facts arising after trial. The mother accepts that due diligence should be eased in instances where it was impossible to adduce the evidence at trial. For the father, it is “by definition . . . not an appropriate consideration” in such cases: R.F., at para. 75. Similarly, the Court of Appeal decided that the due diligence criterion does not strictly govern the admission of new evidence.

[57]                          But under such a formalistic approach, the timing of events — and not the litigant’s conduct — would dictate the application of the due diligence criterion. For events occurring subsequently, the criterion would effectively be eliminated. This would run counter to our jurisprudence, ignore the litigant’s conduct and would fail to safeguard finality and order within the Palmer test. That is precisely what happened in this case. Focusing exclusively on whether the decision would be different gives undue weight to the interest in reaching a just result — and distorts the delicate balance that the Palmer test seeks to maintain.

[58]                          The due diligence criterion is sufficiently flexible to adapt to any unique concerns raised by evidence of facts that occurred subsequent to trial. As this Court held in Bent v. Platnick, 2020 SCC 23, at para. 60, the due diligence criterion is not a rigid one and has been held to be a practical concept that is context-sensitive.

[59]                          Ultimately, this criterion seeks to determine whether the party could — with due diligence — have acted in a way that would have rendered the evidence available for trial. The due diligence inquiry should focus on the conduct of the party seeking to adduce such evidence rather than on the evidence itself. And in doing so, a court should determine, quite simply, why the evidence was not available at the trial: G.D.B., at para. 20.

[60]                          The reason why “new” evidence was unavailable for trial may have its roots in the parties’ pre-trial conduct. For facts arising after trial, courts should consider whether the party’s conduct could have influenced the timing of the fact they seek to prove. Consider this case. If finances are at issue and a party does not take steps to obtain a financing commitment until after trial, the court may ask why the evidence could not have been obtained for trial. Parties cannot benefit from their own inaction when the existence of those facts was partially or entirely within their control. Again, litigants must put their best foot forward at trial. In the end, what matters is that this criterion properly safeguards finality and order in our judicial process.

[61]                          In sum, the focus of the due diligence criterion is on the litigant’s conduct in the particular context of the case. Considering whether the evidence could have been available for trial with the exercise of due diligence is tantamount to the requirement that the evidence could not, with the exercise of due diligence, have been obtained for trial. Where a party seeks to adduce additional evidence on appeal, yet failed to act with due diligence, the Palmer test will generally foreclose admission.

(b)         The Other Palmer Criteria

[62]                          There is no suggestion by the parties that the remaining Palmer criteria should operate differently depending on when the fact the evidence seeks to prove occurred. Needless to say, the evidence must be relevant and credible regardless of when it arose. The interest in reaching a just result requires nothing less.

[63]                          As for the fourth factor — whether the evidence, if believed, could have affected the result at trial — the logic remains the same: a court must approach this criterion purposively. While it is tempting to conclude that evidence of facts arising after trial could never have affected the result at trial, the inquiry is not so narrow. The question is not the evidence’s timing but whether the evidence is sufficiently probative of the trial issues, had it been available. An overly formalistic approach at this stage ignores the underlying rationale of the Palmer criteria — here, the interest in reaching a just result in the context of the proceedings.

[64]                          As noted in Palmer, at p. 776, the fourth criterion will be satisfied if the evidence, assuming it was presented to the trier of fact and believed, possesses such strength or probative force that it might, taken with the other evidence adduced, have affected the result.

(3)         The Palmer Test in Family Law Cases Involving the Best Interests of the Child

[65]                          I turn now to an underlying question raised by this appeal: the flexible application of Palmer in cases involving the best interests of the child.

[66]                          This Court has explained that these cases may require a more flexible application of the fourth Palmer criterion: Catholic Children’s Aid Society, at p. 188. The Court recognized that the best interests analysis — which takes into account a broad range of considerations, including the needs, means, condition and other circumstances unique to the child before the court — widens the scope of evidence that could affect the result. This criterion, however, remains a condition precedent for the admission of evidence in family appeals. But the flexible approach to the fourth criterion is not the only aspect of Palmer that warrants further discussion in the family law context. Two other aspects include (i) the exceptional circumstances where a failure to meet due diligence is not fatal; and (ii) the existence of variation schemes that address factual developments that postdate trial. I address each in turn.

(a)           A Failure to Meet Due Diligence Is Not Fatal in Exceptional Circumstances

[67]                          First, given both the premium placed on certainty in cases involving children and the importance of having accurate and up-to-date information when a child’s future hangs in the balance (Catholic Children’s Aid Society, at p. 188), evidence that does not meet the due diligence criterion may nonetheless be admitted in exceptional circumstances. Let me explain. Finality and order — in both their individual and systemic dimensions — are particularly important in cases involving the best interests of the child: Van de Perre v. Edwards, 2001 SCC 60, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 1014, at para. 13. Children should be afforded the comfort of knowing, with some degree of certainty, where they will live and with whom. And unfortunately, an appeal only prolongs the cloud of uncertainty and the hardship and stress a child must endure.

[68]                          Protracted litigation also places additional strain on the parties’ resources. In the context of a spousal separation, families who resort to the adversarial process are often in crisis, with two households now in need of support. As this Court recognized in Moge v. Moge, 1992 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1992] 3 S.C.R. 813, family litigants, particularly women, are often already shouldering the economic consequences of a marital breakdown. Some will be unable to afford the financial and emotional cost of court proceedings at first instance, let alone the strain of relitigating the facts on appeal. Needlessly prolonging this adversarial process does little to assist parties who must find a way to restructure their relationships and cooperate for the sake of their children.

[69]                          Certainty in a trial outcome can ensure an end to a period of immense turmoil, strife, and costs; parties should do what they can to promote it. Evidence that does not satisfy the due diligence criterion should therefore generally not be admitted, even on an appeal of a best-interests-of-the-child determination.

[70]                          That said, an absence of due diligence may in rare instances be superseded by the interests of justice: see Children’s Aid Society of Halton (Region) v. A. (K.L.) (2006), 2006 CanLII 33538 (ON CA), 32 R.F.L. (6th) 7 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 56. There may be exceptional cases involving a child’s best interests where the need for finality and order may need to yield in the interests of justice. The intervener the Office of the Children’s Lawyer provides one such example: in urgent matters requiring an immediate decision — a pressing medical or other issue bearing on the child’s best interests — it may not serve the interests of justice to require a party to show due diligence and further prolong or delay proceedings.

[71]                          In other cases, admitting the additional evidence may not offend the principle of finality at all, despite the failure to meet the due diligence criterion. For instance, where the appellate court has already identified a material error in the trial judgment below, evidence that may help determine an appropriate order — whether to show the need for a new trial, support a substitute order, or otherwise — may exceptionally warrant admission: Children’s Aid Society of Halton (Region), at paras. 27 and 52‑56; Children’s Aid Society of Toronto v. P. (D.) (2005), 2005 CanLII 34560 (ON CA), 19 R.F.L. (6th) 267 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 8‑9. This may promote timely justice, consistent with a child’s need to have their future determined with due dispatch: C. Leach, E. McCarty and M. Cheung, “Further Evidence in Child Protection Appeals in Ontario” (2012), 31 C.F.L.Q. 177.

[72]                          To be clear, such exceptional circumstances do not dispense with the other Palmer criteria — the evidence still must be relevant, credible, and have some material bearing on the outcome. Similarly, the best interests of the child cannot be routinely leveraged to ignore the due diligence criterion and admit additional evidence on appeal. An appeal is not the continuation of a trial. Rather, the party must satisfy the judge that the interest of finality and order is clearly outweighed by the need to reach a just result in the context of the proceedings. In such circumstances, the interests of justice may demand additional evidence to be admitted on appeal.

(b)         The Existence of Variation Schemes That Address Factual Developments That Postdate Trial in Parenting Cases

[73]                          Turning to the second feature that arises in the family law context, the admission of post-trial evidence on appeal may be unnecessary because, unlike decisions that award damages in one final order, litigation about ongoing parenting arrangements remains subject to court oversight. Specifically, variation schemes permit a judge of first instance to vary a parenting order where a change of circumstances justifies a review of a child’s best interests. As I will explain, the admission of post‑trial evidence on appeal unnecessarily undercuts both finality and order in family law judgments, as well as Parliament’s statutory design.

[74]                          Because variation procedures are available in parenting cases to address changes arising post-trial, the interest in reaching a just result can be fostered through other means. The admission of post-trial evidence on appeal therefore unnecessarily undermines finality and order in family law decisions.

[75]                          Moreover, courts must be wary of permitting parties to use the Palmer framework to circumvent legislative schemes that provide specific procedures for review. An appeal cannot serve as an indirect route of varying the original parenting order. A variation application and an appeal are distinct proceedings based on fundamentally different premises.

[76]                          In a variation proceeding, “[t]he court cannot retry the case, substituting its discretion for that of the original judge; it must assume the correctness of the decision”: Gordon, at para. 11. The applicant bears the burden of proving that a child’s best interests differ from those determined in the original decision because the circumstances on which that decision was based have materially changed since trial. Once an applicant discharges this burden, the assessment is prospective: a variation judge must enter into a fresh inquiry to determine where the best interests of the child lie, considering the findings of fact of the judge who made the previous order, together with the evidence of new circumstances (Gordon, at para. 17). Finality in this context respects the trial judge’s original determination of the child’s best interests: Gordon, at para. 17; Willick v. Willick, 1994 CanLII 28 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 670, at p. 688, per Sopinka J.

[77]                          An appeal, in contrast, is designed to determine whether there is an error in the trial decision. In other words, the correctness of the previous decision — and not the implications of subsequent events — is the focal point in an appeal. This assessment is inherently retrospective, with the review typically circumscribed within the four corners of the judgment below. Here, finality in the original decision is preserved unless the court identifies a material error.

[78]                          It is essential that variation procedures and appeals remain distinct in the family law context: holding otherwise would unfairly require the opposing party to defend the original order — absent a material error — in the wrong forum, with appellate judges effectively performing the work assigned to first instance judges in variation procedures. This would displace the corrective function of appellate courts and allow litigants to circumvent Parliament’s variation scheme.

[79]                          Litigants must not be permitted to game the system in this way: an appeal is not an opportunity to avoid the evidentiary burden in a variation proceeding; nor is it an opportunity to seek a fresh determination, after remedying gaps in a trial strategy with the assistance of the trial judge’s “preliminary” reasons. Such a tactical approach in family cases will often be at the expense of the children.

[80]                          Consequently, in an appeal of a parenting order, courts should consider whether a variation application would be more appropriate in the circumstances. Where an application for additional evidence amounts to what is “in substance a disguised application to vary” (Riel, at para. 20), a court may refuse to admit additional evidence without considering the Palmer criteria.

(4)         The Use of Properly Admitted Evidence on Appeal

[81]                          As a final observation, even when evidence is properly admitted on appeal, appellate courts must defer to the trial judge’s factual findings that are unaffected by the additional evidence. While assessing the proper outcome in light of additional evidence may require a global consideration of the case (St-Cloud; Gordon), appellate courts are not entitled to reweigh or disregard the trial judge’s underlying factual findings absent palpable and overriding error.

(5)         Did the Court of Appeal Err in Admitting the Additional Evidence?

[82]                          In this case, the Court of Appeal erred in admitting the father’s evidence on appeal. It applied the wrong test and failed to consider whether the father exercised due diligence. The evidence could have been available for trial with due diligence. And in any event, this matter could have been dealt with solely on the basis that a fresh evidence motion was not in the interests of justice given the availability of a variation procedure.

[83]                          The father sought to adduce an affidavit at the conclusion of the appeal hearing. He deposed that he had taken steps to pay the mother her interest in the family property “to comply with the order of the trial judge”: C.A. reasons, at para. 27. He also deposed that he refinanced the home and his parents increased their personal line of credit, which went towards renovations that had been partially completed.

[84]                          The father argues that the evidence addressed the trial judge’s concerns that because of their financial position, his ability to remain in the family home, or even in West Kelowna, was “less than certain”: see R.F., at para. 5; see also trial reasons, at para. 40. These preoccupations, he says, are now “demonstrably incorrect”: R.F., at para. 31.

[85]                          In a similar vein, the Court of Appeal admitted the evidence because it was “cogent and material”, and it “directly addresse[d] one of the two primary underpinnings of the trial decision” (para. 51), since the trial judge’s “concern, or expectation, or ‘assumption’” regarding the father’s ability to remain in the family home “ha[d] been displaced” (para. 57).

[86]                          The trial judge’s predictions about the state of the father’s finances and his ability to remain at his residence, however, should not be mischaracterized. It was open to the trial judge to make an assessment about the future and make a finding of fact based on the evidence before him. Here, the fact that the father later moved to cure evidentiary deficiencies regarding his ability to finance and renovate the home does not mean that the trial judge erred in his findings or conclusions.

[87]                          More to the point, the father failed to act with due diligence. Most obviously, the facts he now seeks to prove and rely upon on appeal — that he had the necessary financing to keep his home and make it habitable for the children — were squarely at issue before the trial judge. He could have taken reasonable steps to obtain financing before trial, since he was aware that he needed to refinance to stay in the house: trial reasons, at para. 35. His plan was contingent on obtaining financing from his father, whose testimony was “less definite” (para. 36):

Mr. Grebliunas Sr. has no commitment letters regarding financing. Asked whether he was prepared to offer any more than the amount of the debt, he hedged, saying “We’ll see what the final number is”, and offered his opinion that the property would be “a good investment”. [Emphasis added; para. 38.]

As the trial judge concluded, the practicability of that arrangement remained “an open question”: para. 39.

[88]                          Allowing the father to resolve these concerns and redraw the factual landscape at the eleventh hour of the appeal occasioned considerable unfairness. In effect, he was allowed to relitigate the same issues on the basis of more favourable facts, displacing the corrective function of the appellate court. Nothing on the record indicates that he was prevented from obtaining the financing commitments before trial. This ran firmly against the interest in finality and order that due diligence is meant to safeguard.

[89]                          Further, as noted above, an alternative legislative mechanism for varying the trial order was available to deal with any material changes of circumstances arising after trial: Divorce Act, s. 17(5); Gordon, at para. 10. By successfully adducing the additional evidence, the father was able to circumvent the burden he would have faced in a variation application — that is, proving a change of circumstances from those that justified the children’s relocation to Telkwa. Instead, he received what amounted to a near fresh evaluation of the children’s best interests.

[90]                             A flexible approach to Palmer in cases involving the welfare of children must not permit what is “in substance a disguised application to vary”: Riel, at para. 20. And as stated above, courts should be mindful of not permitting parties to use the Palmer framework to circumvent and undermine parliamentary schemes that provide specific procedures for review or variation upon shifts in the factual landscape.

[91]                             There are no circumstances here that render the admission of this evidence necessary in the interests of justice. The Court of Appeal erred in admitting the additional evidence on appeal.

B.            The Framework Governing Relocation Cases

[92]                             I turn now to the second question in this appeal: whether the trial judge erred in his analysis of the mother’s application to relocate to Telkwa with the children.

[93]                          The father argues that the trial judge erred in his application of the common law framework that governs relocation applications, and that this framework should be updated. He raises concerns regarding the trial judge’s application of Gordon to the parties’ shared parenting arrangement; his treatment of the “maximum contact principle”; the weight he afforded to the mother’s reasons for moving; his neglect of the mother’s testimony that she would stay in Kelowna and co-parent if her application failed; and the impact of family violence and discord between the parties on his analysis: R.F., at paras. 24-29, 33-37, 67 and 84-88.

[94]                          These submissions all bring into focus how case law across the country has refined and supplemented the Gordon framework for over 25 years. Indeed, the Gordon framework is flexible by design; it is not an unyielding set of rules. And with decades of Gordon jurisprudence as a guide, the federal government and many provinces have now enacted statutory relocation regimes that largely reflect the judicial experience evinced in the case law. As I will explain, this jurisprudential and legislative lineage provides a clear framework for all family arrangements going forward. The trial judge’s assessment of the best interests of the child is consistent with this refined framework. It was free from material error and entitled to deference on appeal.

[95]                          My reasons proceed as follows. First, I touch on the best interests of the child and the unique nature of mobility cases. Second, I underline the importance of deference in cases involving parenting issues. Third, I set out the refined Gordon framework in light of jurisprudential and legislative refinements that have occurred over the past two decades. Finally, I turn to the specific issues raised in this case: whether the trial judge erred in his application of the Gordon framework.

(1)         The Best Interests of the Child

[96]                          The best interests of the child are an important legal principle in our justice system: Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law v. Canada (Attorney General), 2004 SCC 4, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 76, at para. 9. It is a staple in domestic statutes, international law, and the common law: see, for example, Divorce Act, s. 16; Convention on the Rights of the Child, Can. T.S. 1992 No. 3, art. 3(1); Gordon; Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1999 CanLII 699 (SCC), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817; A.C. v. Manitoba (Director of Child and Family Services), 2009 SCC 30, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 181; Kanthasamy v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 SCC 61, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 909.

[97]                          But, even with a wealth of jurisprudence as guidance, determining what is “best” for a child is never an easy task. The inquiry is “highly contextual” because of the “multitude of factors that may impinge on the child’s best interest”: Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law, at para. 11; Gordon, at para. 20.

[98]                          The difficulties inherent to the best interests principle are amplified in the relocation context. Untangling family relationships may have profound consequences, especially when children are involved. A child’s welfare remains at the heart of the relocation inquiry, but many traditional considerations do not readily apply in the same way.

[99]                          In Gordon, this Court set out a framework for deciding whether relocation is in the best interests of the child. Under this framework, a judge has the onerous task of determining a child’s best interests in the tangle of competing benefits and detriments posed by either outcome: Hejzlar v. Mitchell-Hejzlar, 2011 BCCA 230, 334 D.L.R. (4th) 49, at para. 23. And as Abella J.A. (as she then was) once observed, “[i]t can be no more than an informed opinion made at a moment in the life of a child about what seems likely to prove to be in that child’s best interests”: MacGyver v. Richards (1995), 1995 CanLII 8886 (ON CA), 22 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.), at p. 489.

(2)         The Importance of Deference in Parenting Cases Affecting the Best Interests of the Child

[100]                     The scope of appellate review in family law cases is narrow: Van de Perre, at para. 11. Determining a child’s best interests is always a fact-specific and highly discretionary determination: Van de Perre, at para. 9. And as Gonthier J. observed, “Courts of Appeal should be highly reluctant to interfere with the exercise of a trial judge’s discretion”: Elsom v. Elsom, 1989 CanLII 100 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1367, at p. 1374.

[101]                     The trial judge is the fact finder and has the benefit of the intangible impact of conducting the trial: R. v. G.F., 2021 SCC 20, at para. 81. After hearing from the parties directly, weighing the evidence, and making factual determinations, the trial court is best positioned to determine the best parenting arrangement.

[102]                     An appellate court’s role, as noted, is instead generally one of error correction; it is not to retry a case. Permitting appellate courts to become venues for dissatisfied parties to relitigate issues already resolved at trial erodes the public’s confidence in the judicial process and the rule of law. The proper functioning of our judicial system requires each level of court to remain moored to its respective role in the administration of justice.

[103]                     Therefore, an appellate court may only intervene where there is a material error, a serious misapprehension of the evidence, or an error in law: Hickey v. Hickey, 1999 CanLII 691 (SCC), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 518, at para. 12; Van de Perre, at para. 11.

[104]                     Absent an error of law or a palpable and overriding error of fact, deference is vital: Housen, at paras. 8, 10, 36 and 39. Appellate courts must review a trial judge’s reasons generously and as a whole, bearing in mind the presumption that trial judges know the law: G.F., at para. 79. As I have explained, an appeal is not a litigant’s opportunity for a “second kick at the can”, especially in parenting cases where finality is of paramount importance: Van de Perre, at para. 13.

(3)         The Legal Principles Governing Relocation Applications

[105]                     For over 25 years, Gordon has been the governing authority for mobility applications. McLachlin J. (as she then was) set out a two‑stage inquiry for determining whether to vary a parenting order under the Divorce Act and permit a custodial parent to relocate with the child: first, the party seeking a variation must show a material change in the child’s circumstances; second, the judge must determine what order reflects the child’s best interests in the new circumstances. Gordon then provided factors to be considered in relocation cases.

[106]                     Although Gordon concerned a variation order, courts have also applied the framework when determining a parenting arrangement at first instance, with appropriate modifications: see Nunweiler v. Nunweiler, 2000 BCCA 300, 186 D.L.R. (4th) 323, at paras. 27‑28; L.D.D. v. J.A.D., 2010 NBCA 69, 364 N.B.R. (2d) 200, at paras. 10, 24-25, 27 and 29; Bjornson v. Creighton (2002), 2002 CanLII 45125 (ON CA), 62 O.R. (3d) 236 (C.A.), at para. 18. As well, courts have applied the framework in cases governed by provincial family law acts, even though Gordon concerned an application under the Divorce Act: Bjornson, at paras. 8 and 17; G.J. v. C.M., 2021 YKSC 20, at para. 26 (CanLII); Droit de la famille — 2294, 2022 QCCA 125, at paras. 11-12 (CanLII).

[107]                     At the time Gordon was rendered, the Divorce Act and provincial family legislations did not contain any provisions pertaining to relocation. In 2019, Parliament amended the Divorce Act to provide a statutory regime that governs relocation applications. Several provinces have enacted similar statutory relocation regimes in recent years: see Family Law Act, S.B.C. 2011, c. 25, ss. 65 to 71; The Children’s Law Act, 2020, S.S. 2020, c. 2, ss. 13 to 17; Children’s Law Reform Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.12, s. 39.4; Family Law Act, S.N.B. 2020, c. 23, ss. 60 to 66; Parenting and Support Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 160, ss. 18E to 18H; Children’s Law Act, S.P.E.I. 2020, c. 59, ss. 46 to 52.

[108]                     Subject to some notable exceptions, the Divorce Act and these provincial statutes largely codified this Court’s framework in Gordon. As I will explain, where they depart from Gordon, the changes reflect the collective judicial experience of applying the framework for over 25 years.

[109]                     The Divorce Act amendments came into force on March 1, 2021, after the courts below decided this case. Therefore, the mobility application under appeal proceeded under the Gordon framework. That said, the transitional provision in s. 35.3 of the amended Divorce Act provides:

35.3 A proceeding commenced under this Act before the day on which this section comes into force and not finally disposed of before that day shall be dealt with and disposed of in accordance with this Act as it reads as of that day.

[110]                     This Court did not receive any submissions on the application of s. 35.3. As I will explain, however, the outcome would be the same regardless of whether this case were decided under the amended Divorce Act or the refined Gordon framework. The new relocation provisions in the Divorce Act largely mirror developments in the common law since Gordon. As a result, I leave the discussion of the transitional provision for another day. This case, however, provides an opportunity to bring the common law framework in line with the amended Divorce Act to assist judges in dealing with future mobility cases.

[111]                     In the sections that follow, I clarify how certain aspects of the framework for determining parental relocation issues have evolved since this Court decided Gordon.

(a)           Determining Relocation Issues at First Instance and by Way of Variation Applications

[112]                     The approach to mobility issues when they are raised at first instance, as in this case, differs from the approach to such issues when they are raised by way of a variation application, as in Gordon. Without a pre-existing judicial determination, a parent’s desire to relocate is simply part of the factual matrix in the assessment of what parenting arrangement is in the best interests of the child. Therefore, the first stage of Gordon — which sets out the usual requirement for a variation order — has no application.

[113]                     Even where there is an existing parenting order, relocation will typically constitute a material change in circumstances and therefore satisfy the first stage of the Gordon framework: Gordon, at para. 14; see also Divorce Act, s. 17(5.2).

[114]                     Therefore, regardless of how the relocation issue is brought before the court, the first stage of the Gordon inquiry will likely not raise a contentious issue. That said, when the relocation issue arises by way of a variation application, a court must consider the findings of fact of the judge who made the previous order, together with the evidence of new circumstances: Gordon, at para. 17. The history of parenting arrangements is always relevant to understanding a child’s best interests.

(b)         Determining a Child’s Best Interests in Mobility Cases

[115]                     Accordingly, the so-called second stage of the Gordon framework is often the sole issue when determining a relocation issue. The crucial question is whether relocation is in the best interests of the child.

[116]                     Five considerations that bear upon the best-interests-of-the-child analysis arise in this case: (i) the application of Gordon to shared parenting arrangements and the so-called “great respect principle”; (ii) a moving parent’s reasons for relocation; (iii) the “maximum contact principle”; (iv) a moving parent’s testimony about how the outcome of the application will influence their decision to relocate; and (v) the impact of family violence. I address each in turn, looking at their evolution in the case law since Gordon and their reflection in amendments to the Divorce Act.

(i)           The Application of Gordon to Shared Parenting Arrangements and the So-Called “Great Respect Principle”

[117]                     In determining the best interests of the child, Gordon first instructs that “[t]he inquiry does not begin with a legal presumption in favour of the custodial parent, although the custodial parent’s views are entitled to great respect”: para. 49.

[118]                     In this case, the father contends that this aspect of Gordon is of limited value where there is a shared parenting arrangement: R.F., at para. 28. He says the trial judge should not have paid special “respect” to the mother’s decision to move given their history of shared parenting roles. He relies on Newbury J.A.’s observation in Q. (R.E.) v. K. (G.J.), 2012 BCCA 146, 348 D.L.R. (4th) 622, at para. 58, that “[i]t is not clear how the ‘great respect’ principle should work where both parents are custodial parents.”

[119]                     The parent who cares for the child on a daily basis is in a unique position to assess what is in their best interests: Gordon, at para. 48. This logic applies to both parents in a shared parenting arrangement, and accordingly, both of their views are entitled to great respect in an assessment of the child’s best interests. This makes sense: a court always pays careful attention to the views of the parents. In my view, it adds little value to this analysis to label it a separate principle of “great respect”.

[120]                     As for any legal presumption in relocation cases, the Court in Gordon noted that the wording of the Divorce Act belied the need to defer to the custodial parent. Rather, the Act expressly stipulated that the judge hearing the application should be concerned only with the best interests of the child, and the variation provisions did not place a burden on any parent at the merits stage of the analysis: paras. 37 and 39.

[121]                     But over time, certain patterns have emerged. In practice, a move is more likely to be approved where the clear primary caregiver for a child seeks to relocate and more likely to be denied if there is a shared parenting arrangement. Professor Thompson refers to this as the unspoken “primary caregiver presumption”: see D. A. R. Thompson, “Ten Years After Gordon: No Law, Nowhere” (2007), 35 R.F.L. (6th) 307, at p. 317; R. Thompson, “Where Is B.C. Law Going? The New Mobility” (2012), 30 C.F.L.Q. 235.

[122]                     In discussing presumptions, Gordon relied on the fact that Parliament had not set out any general rules. It has since done so. In 2019, Parliament enacted a burden of proof, set out in s. 16.93 of the Divorce Act, which corresponds to the broad trends in the jurisprudence.

[123]                     Therefore, in all cases, the history of caregiving will be relevant. And while it may not be useful to label the attention courts pay to the views of the parent as a separate “great respect” principle, the history of caregiving will sometimes warrant a burden of proof in favour of one parent. Indeed, federal and provincial legislatures have increasingly enacted presumptions, bringing clarity to the law. In all cases, however, the inquiry remains an individual one. The judge must consider the best interests of the particular child in the particular circumstances of the case. Other considerations may demonstrate that relocation is in the child’s best interests, even if the parties have historically co-parented.

(ii)        The Reasons for Relocation

[124]                     The second refinement to the Gordon framework concerns the moving parent’s reasons for relocating. Here, the father and the Court of Appeal took issue with the weight the trial judge ascribed to the mother’s reasons for relocation, the implication being that this consideration detracted from his focus on the child’s best interests.

[125]                     In Gordon, McLachlin J. cautioned that courts should avoid “descend[ing] into inquiries into the custodial parent’s reason or motive for moving” because “[u]sually, the reasons or motives for moving will not be relevant to the custodial parent’s parenting ability”: paras. 22-23. Therefore, “absent a connection to parenting ability, the custodial parent’s reason for moving should not enter into the inquiry”: para. 23. To hold otherwise, McLachlin J. reasoned, would shift the focus from the best interests of the child to the conduct of the custodial parent: para. 22.

[126]                     In practice, courts across the country have found that the reason for the move often bears on the best interests of the child: N. Bala, “Bill C-78: The 2020 Reforms to the Parenting Provisions of Canada’s Divorce Act” (2020), 39 C.F.L.Q. 45, at p. 71; Thompson (2007); E. Jollimore and R. Sladic, “Mobility — Are We There Yet?” (2008), 27 C.F.L.Q. 341.

[127]                     Recent amendments to the Divorce Act now instruct courts to consider the moving parent’s reasons for relocation: s. 16.92(1)(a). Similarly, provinces across Canada have incorporated the moving parent’s reasons for relocation within their statutory relocation regimes: Family Law Act, s. 69(6)(a) (B.C.); The Children’s Law Act, 2020, s. 15(1)(a) (Sask.); Children’s Law Reform Act, s. 39.4(3)(a) (Ont.); Family Law Act, s. 62(1)(a) (N.B.); Parenting and Support Act, s. 18H(4)(b) (N.S.); Children’s Law Act, s. 48(1)(a) (P.E.I.).

[128]                     Indeed, isolating the custodial parent’s reasons for the move from the broad, individualized inquiry of the child’s best interests has frequently proven impractical. There will often be a connection between the expected benefits of the move for the child and the relocating parent’s reasons for proposing the move in the first place. Relocation for financial reasons, for instance, will clearly carry implications for a child’s material welfare. Considering the parent’s reasons for moving can be relevant, and even necessary, to assess the merits of a relocation application.

[129]                     That said, the court should avoid casting judgment on a parent’s reasons for moving. A moving parent need not prove the move is justified. And a lack of a compelling reason for the move, in and of itself, should not count against a parent, unless it reflects adversely on a parent’s ability to meet the needs of the child: Ligate v. Richardson (1997), 1997 CanLII 650 (ON CA), 34 O.R. (3d) 423 (C.A.), at p. 434.

[130]                     Ultimately, the moving parent’s reasons for relocating must not deflect from the focus of relocation applications — they must be considered only to the extent they are relevant to the best interests of the child.

(iii)      The “Maximum Contact Principle” or “Parenting Time Consistent With the Best Interests of the Child”

[131]                     Gordon requires courts to consider “the desirability of maximizing contact between the child and both parents”: para. 49. This consideration has been referred to as the “maximum contact principle”: see Gordon, at para. 24; see also Young v. Young, 1993 CanLII 34 (SCC), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 3, at p. 53, per L’Heureux-Dubé J., and p. 118, per McLachlin J. (as she then was). In this case, the father contends that the trial judge neglected this consideration.

[132]                     Concerns about parenting time with the child will inevitably be engaged in relocation cases: the crux of the dispute is whether it is in the child’s best interests to move notwithstanding the impact on their relationship with the other parent. In other words, this concern is folded into the central inquiry before the court.

[133]                     What is known as the maximum contact principle has traditionally emphasized that children shall have as much contact with each parent as is consistent with their best interests. A corollary to this is sometimes referred to as the “friendly parent rule”, which instructs courts to consider the willingness of a parent to foster and support the child’s relationship with the other parent, where appropriate: see Young, at p. 44. Both of these considerations have long been recognized by the Divorce Act: see Divorce Act, pre-amendments, ss. 16(10) and 17(9); and Divorce Act, post‑amendments, ss. 16(6) and 16(3)(c).

[134]                     Although Gordon placed emphasis on the “maximum contact principle”, it was clear that the best interests of the child are the sole consideration in relocation cases, and “if other factors show that it would not be in the child’s best interests, the court can and should restrict contact”: Gordon, at para. 24; see also para. 49. But in the years since Gordon, some courts have interpreted what is known as the “maximum contact principle” as effectively creating a presumption in favour of shared parenting arrangements, equal parenting time, or regular access: Folahan v. Folahan, 2013 ONSC 2966, at para. 14 (CanLII); Slade v. Slade, 2002 YKSC 40, at para. 10 (CanLII); see also F. Kelly, “Enforcing a Parent/Child Relationship At All Cost? Supervised Access Orders in the Canadian Courts” (2011), 49 Osgoode Hall L.J. 277, at pp. 278 and 296-98. Indeed, the term “maximum contact principle” seems to imply that as much contact with both parents as possible will necessarily be in the best interests of the child.

[135]                     These interpretations overreach. It is worth repeating that what is known as the maximum contact principle is only significant to the extent that it is in the child’s best interests; it must not be used to detract from this inquiry. It is notable that the amended Divorce Act recasts the “maximum contact principle” as “[p]arenting time consistent with best interests of child”: s. 16(6). This shift in language is more neutral and affirms the child-centric nature of the inquiry. Indeed, going forward, the “maximum contact principle” is better referred to as the “parenting time factor”.

(iv)      A Parent’s Testimony About Whether They Will Relocate Regardless of the Outcome of the Relocation Application

[136]                     Gordon is silent as to whether, and how, a trier of fact may consider how the outcome of an application would affect the parties’ relocation plans. In this case, the mother indicated that she would return to Kelowna if her application was refused, while the father indicated he would not move to the Bulkley Valley if her application was granted.

[137]                     In the years since Gordon, many courts have recognized the danger that such evidence will place parties in a “double bind”. As Paperny J.A. explained in Spencer v. Spencer, 2005 ABCA 262, 257 D.L.R. (4th) 115, at para. 18:

   In conducting this inquiry, it is problematic to rely on representations by the custodial parent that he or she will not move without the children should the application to relocate be denied. The effect of such an inquiry places the parent seeking to relocate in a classic double bind. If the answer is that the parent is not willing to remain behind with the children, he or she raises the prospect of being regarded as self interested and discounting the children’s best interests in favour of his or her own. On the other hand, advising the court that the parent is prepared to forgo the requested move if unsuccessful, undermines the submissions in favour of relocation by suggesting that such a move is not critical to the parent’s well-being or to that of the children. If a judge mistakenly relies on a parent’s willingness to stay behind “for the sake of the children,” the status quo becomes an attractive option for a judge to favour because it avoids the difficult decision the application presents.

[138]                     I agree. Considering a parent’s willingness to move with or without the child can give rise to a double bind: a parent can either appear to be putting their own interests ahead of their child, or they risk undermining the strength of their relocation application (see D.P. v. R.B., 2009 PECA 12, 285 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 61, at para. 32; Jollimore and Sladic, at pp. 373-74).

[139]                     This risk has led appellate courts in many provinces to discourage trial judges from relying on a parent’s representations about whether they will move without the children: see Hopkins v. Hopkins, 2011 ABCA 372, at para. 6 (CanLII); Hejzlar, at paras. 24‑27; D.P., at para. 32; N.T. v. W.P., 2011 NLCA 47, 309 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 350, at para. 9; Morrill v. Morrill, 2016 MBCA 66, 330 Man. R. (2d) 165, at para. 12.

[140]                     The same approach is now reflected in the Divorce Act: s. 16.92(2) precludes the court from considering whether the moving parent would relocate with or without the children. I would add that a responding parent could just as easily fall victim to the problematic inferences associated with the double bind: see Joseph v. Washington, 2021 BCSC 2014, at paras. 101-11 (CanLII). Therefore, in all cases, the court should not consider how the outcome of an application would affect the parties’ relocation plans.

(v)         Family Violence as a Relevant Factor

[141]                     In this case, the acrimonious relationship between the parties — featuring abusive conduct during the marriage, at separation, and at trial — was a significant factor in the trial judge’s relocation analysis. On appeal, the father argues that such “friction” is “not unusual for separating couples”: R.F., at para. 35.

[142]                     Since Gordon, courts have increasingly recognized that any family violence or abuse may affect a child’s welfare and should be considered in relocation decisions: see Prokopchuk v. Borowski, 2010 ONSC 3833, 88 R.F.L. (6th) 140; Lawless v. Lawless, 2003 ABQB 800, at para. 12 (CanLII); Cameron v. Cameron, 2003 MBQB 149, 41 R.F.L. (5th) 30; Abbott-Ewen v. Ewen, 2010 ONSC 2121, 86 R.F.L. (6th) 428; N.D.L. v. M.S.L., 2010 NSSC 68, 289 N.S.R. (2d) 8, at paras. 22-23 and 35; E.S.M. v. J.B.B., 2012 NSCA 80, 319 N.S.R. (2d) 232, at paras. 55-57. Courts have been significantly more likely to allow relocation applications where there was a finding of abuse: Department of Justice, A Study of Post-Separation/Divorce Parental Relocation (2014), at ch. 3.3.4.

[143]                     The suggestion that domestic abuse or family violence has no impact on the children and has nothing to do with the perpetrator’s parenting ability is untenable. Research indicates that children who are exposed to family violence are at risk of emotional and behavioural problems throughout their lives: Department of Justice, Risk Factors for Children in Situations of Family Violence in the Context of Separation and Divorce (February 2014), at p. 12. Harm can result from direct or indirect exposure to domestic conflicts, for example, by observing the incident, experiencing its aftermath, or hearing about it: S. Artz et al., “A Comprehensive Review of the Literature on the Impact of Exposure to Intimate Partner Violence for Children and Youth” (2014), 5 I.J.C.Y.F.S. 493, at p. 497.

[144]                     Domestic violence allegations are notoriously difficult to prove: P. G. Jaffe, C. V. Crooks and N. Bala, “A Framework for Addressing Allegations of Domestic Violence in Child Custody Disputes” (2009), 6 J. Child Custody 169, at p. 175; A. M. Bailey, “Prioritizing Child Safety as the Prime Best-Interest Factor” (2013), 47 Fam. L.Q. 35, at pp. 44-45. As the interveners West Coast LEAF Association and Rise Women’s Legal Centre point out, family violence often takes place behind closed doors and may lack corroborating evidence: see S. B. Boyd and R. Lindy, “Violence Against Women and the B.C. Family Law Act: Early Jurisprudence” (2016), 35 C.F.L.Q. 101, at p. 115. Thus, proof of even one incident may raise safety concerns for the victim or may overlap with and enhance the significance of other factors, such as the need for limited contact or support.

[145]                     The prospect that such findings could be unnecessarily relitigated on appeal will only deter abuse survivors from coming forward. And as it stands, the evidence shows that most family violence goes unreported: L. C. Neilson, Responding to Domestic Violence in Family Law, Civil Protection & Child Protection Cases (2nd ed. 2020), 2017 CanLIIDocs 2 (online), at ch. 4.5.2.

[146]                     The recent amendments to the Divorce Act recognize that findings of family violence are a critical consideration in the best interests analysis: s. 16(3)(j) and (4). The Divorce Act broadly defines family violence in s. 2(1) to include any violent or threatening conduct, ranging from physical abuse to psychological and financial abuse. Courts must consider family violence and its impact on the ability and willingness of any person who engaged in the family violence to care for and meet the needs of the child.

[147]                     Because family violence may be a reason for the relocation and given the grave implications that any form of family violence poses for the positive development of children, this is an important factor in mobility cases.

(c)           Summary of the Framework for Determining Whether Relocation Is in the Best Interests of the Child

[148]                     More than two decades ago, this Court set out a framework for relocation applications in Gordon: paras. 49-50. It applies to relocation issues that arise at first instance and in the context of applications to vary existing parenting orders.

[149]                     Since then, our jurisprudence has refined the Gordon framework, and, subject to two notable exceptions, the Divorce Act has largely codified it. Where the Divorce Act departs from Gordon, the changes reflect the collective judicial experience of applying the Gordon factors. While Gordon rejected a legal presumption in favour of either party, the Divorce Act now contains a burden of proof where there is a pre‑existing parenting order, award or agreement: s. 16.93. And although Gordon restricted whether courts could consider a moving party’s reasons for relocating, this is now an express consideration in the best-interests-of-the-child analysis: s. 16.92(1)(a).

[150]                     The new Divorce Act amendments also respond to issues identified in the case law over the past few decades, which did not arise in Gordon. Section 16.92(2) now provides that trial judges shall not consider a parent’s testimony that they would move with or without the child. Furthermore, ss. 16(3)(j) and 16(4) of the Divorce Act now instruct courts to consider any form of family violence and its impact on the perpetrator’s ability to care for the child.

[151]                     In light of the jurisprudential and legislative refinements, the common law relocation framework can be restated as follows.

[152]                     The crucial question is whether relocation is in the best interests of the child, having regard to the child’s physical, emotional and psychological safety, security and well-being. This inquiry is highly fact-specific and discretionary.

[153]                     Our jurisprudence and statutes provide a rich foundation for such an inquiry: see, for example, s. 16 of the Divorce Act. A court shall consider all factors related to the circumstances of the child, which may include the child’s views and preferences, the history of caregiving, any incidents of family violence, or a child’s cultural, linguistic, religious and spiritual upbringing and heritage. A court shall also consider each parent’s willingness to support the development and maintenance of the child’s relationship with the other parent, and shall give effect to the principle that a child should have as much time with each parent, as is consistent with the best interests of the child. These examples are illustrative, not exhaustive. While some of these factors were specifically noted under Gordon, they have broad application to the best interests of the child.

[154]                     However, traditional considerations bearing on the best interests of the child must be considered in the context of the unique challenges posed by relocation cases. In addition to the factors that a court will generally consider when determining the best interests of the child and any applicable notice requirements, a court should also consider:

•                           the reasons for the relocation;

•                           the impact of the relocation on the child;

•                           the amount of time spent with the child by each person who has parenting time or a pending application for a parenting order and the level of involvement in the child’s life of each of those persons;

•                           the existence of an order, arbitral award, or agreement that specifies the geographic area in which the child is to reside;

•                              the reasonableness of the proposal of the person who intends to relocate the child to vary the exercise of parenting time, decision making responsibility or contact, taking into consideration, among other things, the location of the new place of residence and the travel expenses; and

•                              whether each person who has parenting time or decision-making responsibility or a pending application for a parenting order has complied with their obligations under family law legislation, an order, arbitral award, or agreement, and the likelihood of future compliance.

The court should not consider how the outcome of an application would affect either party’s relocation plans — for example, whether the person who intends to move with the child would relocate without the child or not relocate. These factors are drawn from s. 16.92(1) and (2) of the Divorce Act and largely reflect the evolution of the common law for over 25 years.

[155]                     As I have explained, several pillars underlying the Court’s reasoning in Gordon have shifted over time, leading courts and now legislatures to refine, modify, and supplement the Gordon factors. These refinements leave us with a clear framework going forward.

(4)         Did the Trial Judge Err in His Relocation Analysis?

[156]                     The father raises four issues with the trial judge’s analysis. He argues that (i) the trial judge failed to account for the historical parenting roles of the parties; (ii) the trial judge’s decision was inconsistent with the parenting time factor; (iii) the mother’s need for emotional support could not justify relocation in this case; and (iv) the trial judge paid undue attention to the acrimonious relationship between the parties.

[157]                     I would not accede to any of these submissions. The trial judge’s Gordon analysis was free from a material error, serious misapprehension of evidence, or error of law.

(a)           The Trial Judge’s Decision Considered the Historical Parenting Roles of the Parties

[158]                     The father first contends the trial judge’s analysis did not reflect the parties’ shared parenting responsibilities throughout the marriage and after separation. This submission relies on the trial judge’s statement, derived from Gordon, that “barring an improper motive, relocation must be approached from the perspective of respect for a parent’s decision to live and work where they choose”: para. 21. This statement, says the father, may be applicable to the views of a “custodial” parent, but it is not applicable where both parents have been fully engaged in a shared parenting arrangement.

[159]                     In my view, the trial judge’s reasons do not suggest that he gave more “respect” or undue weight to the mother’s desire to live and work in Telkwa. Rather, the trial judge canvassed, in detail, why staying in Kelowna with their father was not best for the children. Most notably, the trial judge was concerned about the father’s animosity towards the mother and the possibility that it could influence or otherwise impact the children: paras. 41-42. There were significant issues with the Kelowna residence, which was described as a working environment, not a living environment: para. 33. And the children and the mother would benefit from family support in Telkwa, including from her parents and siblings: para. 44.

[160]                     Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge erred by failing to consider Kelowna as a viable option, especially because the mother testified that she was willing to move to Kelowna should the application be denied. The mother’s evidence on this point, however, could not be determinative. The trial judge understood the risk posed by the double bind.

[161]                     The Court of Appeal also took issue with the trial judge’s failure to consider whether the children should stay with their father in Kelowna since he also concluded that either “parent was, in concept, able to care for the children”: C.A. reasons, at para. 86. However, the trial judge expressed serious reservations about whether the father would foster a positive relationship between the children and their mother: para. 42. The trial judge was right to take this into consideration when determining the options before him.

[162]                     The trial judge’s reasoning on these points disclosed no reviewable error. It was owed deference on appeal.

(b)         The Trial Judge Considered Parenting Time Consistent With the Best Interests of the Child

[163]                     The father submits the trial judge failed to give due weight to the parenting time factor. The Court of Appeal took a similar position, concluding that “[p]ermitting the relocation was inconsistent with the object of maximizing contact between the children and both their parents. Indeed the relocation was likely to permanently and profoundly alter the relationship of the children with their father”: para. 87. I have two concerns with this line of reasoning.

[164]                     First, the question before the trial judge was not how to best promote the parenting time factor; it was how to best promote the best interests of the children. These considerations are not synonymous. Nor are they necessarily mutually reinforcing. Courts should only give effect to the parenting time factor to the extent that it is in the best interests of the child.

[165]                     Second, the trial judge did not fail to consider that children should have as much contact with each parent as is consistent with their best interests. He considered that “the children would suffer a very significant loss in being deprived of frequent care from and contact with their father” and “[t]here would also be some detriment to the children in removing them from the community they have lived in and the friends they have made”: para. 50. He was clearly alive to the risk of reducing contact with the father.

[166]                     The trial judge also did not fail to consider the corollary of the parenting time factor: whether either parent would be willing to facilitate contact and help foster a positive relationship between the children and the other parent. Again, the trial judge concluded that the father harboured animus towards the mother, and that she was more likely to build a positive relationship between the children and him than the converse.

[167]                     On the whole, the trial judge found that relocation would best promote the children’s welfare, notwithstanding the impact on the relationship between the children and their father. This was a determination the trial judge was entitled to make, and it was owed deference on appeal.

(c)           The Mother’s Need for Emotional Support

[168]                     The father submits the trial judge gave undue weight to the mother’s need for emotional support. The Court of Appeal similarly held that a parent’s need for emotional support, “even with some friction between the parties”, cannot justify relocation: para. 74.

[169]                     The mother’s need for emotional support was a relevant consideration in the best interests analysis. The mother followed the father to Kelowna, but her family remained in Telkwa. A move that can improve a parent’s emotional and psychological state can enrich a parent’s ability to cultivate a healthy, supportive, and positive environment for their child. Courts have frequently recognized that a child’s best interests are furthered by a well-functioning and happy parent: Burns v. Burns, 2000 NSCA 1, 183 D.L.R. (4th) 66, at pp. 81-82; L. (S.S.) v. W. (J.W.), 2010 BCCA 55, 316 D.L.R. (4th) 464, at para. 33; Bjornson, at para. 30; Orring v. Orring, 2006 BCCA 523, 276 D.L.R. (4th) 211, at para. 57.

[170]                     It is also simplistic to suggest that emotional support for the mother was the only benefit that weighed in favour of relocation. The trial judge described, in great detail, how the continuing animosity between the parents would impact the children should they stay in Kelowna. He also noted that the move would provide the mother with the benefit of housing support, childcare, better employment, and opportunities to advance her education: paras. 1, 44 and 46-47.

[171]                     These considerations all have direct or indirect bearing on the best‑interests‑of‑the‑child assessment. Relocation that provides a parent with more education, employment opportunities, and economic stability can contribute to a child’s wellbeing: Larose v. Larose, 2002 BCCA 366, 1 B.C.L.R. (4th) 262, at paras. 6 and 19; H.S. v. C.S., 2006 SKCA 45, 279 Sask. R. 55, at para. 26; see also E. El Fateh, “A Presumption for the Best?” (2009), 25 Can. J. Fam. L. 73, at pp. 80-83.

[172]                     Similarly, the additional support of family and community at the new location can enhance the parent’s ability to care for the children: D.A.F. v. S.M.O., 2004 ABCA 261, 354 A.R. 387, at para. 17. Extended family, for example, can provide additional support to children while their parents begin to navigate the new terrain of post-separation life: Harnett v. Clements, 2019 NLCA 53, 30 R.F.L. (8th) 49, at paras. 22 and 42; C.M. v. R.L., 2013 NSFC 29, at para. 139 (CanLII).

[173]                     It is often difficult to disentangle the interests of a parent from the interests of a child. Indeed, “the reality that the nurture of children is inextricably intertwined with the well-being of the nurturing parent” is far from novel: Pelech v. Pelech, 1987 CanLII 57 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 801, at p. 845; see also Willick, at pp. 724-25, per L’Heureux-Dubé J. A child’s welfare is often advanced in tandem with improvements in the parent’s financial, social, and emotional circumstances. The trial judge found this to be the case here.

[174]                     At all times, the trial judge remained focused on the child’s best interests. He only considered the mother’s needs — emotional or otherwise — to the extent that they were relevant to the children. The trial judge was clearly of the view that relocation would both directly and indirectly benefit the children, whereas “they would at least suffer indirectly to some degree if their mother remained in the Okanagan”: para. 46.

[175]                     Once again, his analysis on this point was free from any reviewable error.

(d)         The Parties’ Acrimonious Relationship

[176]                     The father also submits the trial judge erred in placing undue emphasis on the acrimonious relationship between the parties. For the father, the “friction” was a “thing of the past” (R.F., at para. 34), it was nothing unusual for parties who are separating, and there was no evidence that it occasioned any distress for the children.

[177]                     I disagree. The trial judge’s factual findings were well supported by the evidence.

[178]                     The trial judge carefully explained why he viewed the parties’ relationship as acrimonious, both during the marriage and at the time of trial. He found that there was friction during the marriage: the mother had been subject to the father’s controlling and overbearing personality; there was “possibly some degree of emotional abuse”; she had been physically assaulted; and she was emotionally traumatized.

[179]                     And the father’s continued animosity towards the mother became readily apparent during the trial itself. The trial judge found his conduct at trial to be abusive: para. 41. Most notably, the father adduced a nude “selfie” of the mother in an affidavit, which the trial judge found served no purpose but to humiliate her. The trial judge also noted that the assault, and the father’s denials that it had occurred, was “likely to be an ongoing source of acrimony”: para. 41 (emphasis added).The trial judge concluded that this high-conflict relationship between the parties had “particularly significant” implications for the children: para. 41. These considerations weighed in favour of the children staying primarily with the mother. In these circumstances, it was open for the trial judge to conclude that a co-parenting arrangement could only work in Telkwa. If the mother returned to Kelowna, she would likely be socially isolated and reliant on the father.

[180]                     Despite the trial judge’s findings, which were well supported by the record, the Court of Appeal intervened because “the trial judge’s concerns about Mr. Grebliunas’ behaviour towards Ms. Barendregt warrant some context”: para. 70.

[181]                     The court identified four factors that purportedly “attenuated” the seriousness of the circumstances. First, the mother never argued that hostility between the parties supported her move; her evidence was that the parties were getting along better than when they first separated. Second, many of the issues the judge had been concerned about had taken place in the past. Third, there was no evidence of any event involving or taking place in the presence of the children since separation. And fourth, the trial judge failed to consider the evidence that the parties’ relationship was improving.

[182]                     None of these factors gave the Court of Appeal licence to disturb the trial judge’s factual findings regarding the relationship between the parties.

[183]                     First, although counsel for the mother did not advance the father’s animus as a factor that supported relocation, the state of the parties’ relationship was obviously relevant. And as the interveners West Coast LEAF Association and Rise Women’s Legal Centre point out, it is important to be aware of the social and legal barriers to women disclosing family violence in family law proceedings.

[184]                     Second, the parties’ acrimonious relationship was far from a relic of the distant past. Again, the acrimony surfaced during the trial itself. And abusive dynamics often do not end with separation — in fact, the opposite is often true: Jaffe, Crooks and Bala, at p. 171; Neilson, at ch. 4.5.1, 7.2.2 and 7.2.6. Trial judges have the advantage of observing the dynamic between the parties first-hand; any resulting assessment of their ability to work together in the future must attract deference.

[185]                     Third, the fact that there was no evidence of any event involving the children, or taking place in the children’s presence, could not be determinative. Not only can indirect exposure to conflict have implications for the children’s welfare, the trial judge found there was a significant risk that conflict between the parties would spill over and directly impact the children. He was entitled to make that finding on the evidence before him.

[186]                     Fourth, the record discloses no indication that the trial judge forgot, ignored, or misconceived the evidence showing improvements in the parties’ relationship. An omission in the reasons, in and of itself, does not mean that the appellate court is permitted to review the evidence heard at trial. And in any event, cooperating, staying, or reconciling with a party does not necessarily indicate that an incident of abuse or violence was not serious: see D. Martinson and M. Jackson, “Family Violence and Evolving Judicial Roles: Judges as Equality Guardians in Family Law Cases” (2017), 30 Can. J. Fam. L. 11, at p. 34. In the end, what mattered was the trial judge’s conclusion that it was unlikely that the parents could work cooperatively to promote the children’s best interests in a shared parenting structure in the near future: para. 42.

[187]                     Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge’s findings regarding the acrimonious relationship between the parties could “no longer support the ultimate result arrived at by the trial judge”: para. 69.

[188]                     Quite simply, however, it was not the place of the Court of Appeal to decide that the broader context could “attenuate” the seriousness of the father’s behavior in the absence of an overriding and palpable error. Nor was it the court’s place to reweigh a factor that had been carefully considered by the trial judge. A difference in opinion does not provide an appellate court licence to eclipse the trial court’s judgment in favour of its own. The Court of Appeal was wrong to dispense with deference in the absence of a reversible error.

(e)           The Other Gordon Factors

[189]                     I am satisfied that the trial judge’s Gordon analysis was free from material error. The following factors all supported the trial judge’s conclusion that relocation was in the children’s best interests: there was a significant risk that the high-conflict nature of the parents’ relationship would impact the children if they stayed in Kelowna; the mother needed her family’s support to independently care for the children, which was only available in Telkwa; she was more willing to facilitate a positive relationship between the children and the father than the converse; and there were findings of family violence. I see no reason to set aside the trial judge’s decision.

VI.         Disposition

[190]                     The appeal is allowed. The decision of the Court of Appeal is set aside, and paras. 1 to 6 of the trial judge’s order regarding the primary residence of the children are restored. The mother is entitled to her costs in this Court and the courts below.

 

The following are the reasons delivered by

 

                  Côté J. —

I.               Overview

[191]                     I have had the benefit of reading my colleague Justice Karakatsanis’s reasons. While I agree that the test laid out in Palmer v. The Queen, 1979 CanLII 8 (SCC), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, governs, as it applies to both “fresh” and “new” evidence, I disagree with my colleague’s application of Palmer to the facts of this appeal. For the reasons that follow, I would uphold the Court of Appeal’s ultimate conclusion that the evidence is admissible, but reject its treatment of Palmer and its decision to reassess the best interests of the children.

[192]                     I respectfully part company with my colleague’s analysis on two points. First, it is in my view inappropriate to comment on the Gordon v. Goertz, 1996 CanLII 191 (SCC), [1996] 2 S.C.R. 27, framework in the context of this appeal. This issue was not raised by the appellant, Ms. Barendregt (“mother”), nor was it formally raised by the respondent, Mr. Grebliunas (“father”), who did not cross‑appeal. It is therefore not properly before this Court. Even if it were, I do not believe it prudent to comment on amendments to the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.), without the benefit of submissions and of a full evidentiary record on the matter. It follows that I cannot agree with my colleague’s analysis as set out in paras. 105‑89 of her reasons. I will say no more on this issue; it ought to be left for another day.

[193]                     Second, as I mentioned, I disagree with my colleague’s application of Palmer to the facts of this case. Appellate courts that strictly apply the Palmer test tend to focus too narrowly on the potential for further evidence to distort the appellate standard of review rather than properly focusing on the best interests of the child as the overriding consideration. The Palmer test must be applied flexibly in all cases involving the welfare of children. My colleague recognizes this well‑established principle, yet her application of Palmer is devoid of flexibility.

[194]                     On a proper application of Palmer, I would admit the new evidence and remand the appeal to the trial court for reconsideration of the children’s best interests in light of the new information regarding the father’s financial situation and the condition of the West Kelowna home. The effect of holding otherwise would be to relocate 2 children 1,000 km away from their father based on an inaccurate picture of reality.

II.            Analysis

[195]                     As my colleague rightfully notes, the Palmer test must be applied more flexibly in family law cases involving the best interests of a child (para. 67; Catholic Children’s Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto v. M. (C.), 1994 CanLII 83 (SCC), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 165). In such cases, an accurate assessment of the current situation of the parties, and of the children in particular, is of crucial importance (Catholic Children’s Aid, at p. 188). A child’s welfare is “ongoing and fluid, an undammed stream, and usually it is better that the Court have the full context” (T.G. v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Community Services), 2012 NSCA 43, 316 N.S.R. (2d) 202, at para. 82).

[196]                     Although the rules for admitting new evidence are not designed to permit litigants to retry their cases, it is trite law that the best interests of a child “may provide a compelling reason to admit evidence on appeal” (C.K.S. v. O.S.S., 2014 ABCA 416, at para. 10 (CanLII)). After all, a custody appeal “is ultimately about a child and will affect the welfare of a child” (Bacic v. Ivakic, 2017 SKCA 23, 409 D.L.R. (4th) 571, at para. 24; see also P. (J.) v. P. (J.), 2016 SKCA 168, 89 R.F.L. (7th) 92, at para. 24; O. (A.) v. E. (T.), 2016 SKCA 148, 88 R.F.L. (7th) 34, at paras. 115‑17; C.L.B. v. J.A.B., 2016 SKCA 101, 484 Sask. R. 228, at paras. 21‑22).

[197]                     This flexibility is borne out by a review of the relevant case law. Over the last decade, Canadian appellate courts admitted additional evidence in family law cases in 48 out of 152 reported cases reviewed. Notably, however, the national rate of admission was considerably higher in cases involving child custody and the welfare of children. In 85 such cases, the court admitted the evidence almost half the time (41 out of 85). By contrast, the national rate of admission in cases not concerning children was closer to one tenth (7 out of 67). This supports my view that the rules for admitting further evidence ought to be relaxed — and in practice are relaxed — where the best interests of a child are at stake.

[198]                     My colleague appears to accept the importance of flexibility in this context. She notes that there may be “exceptional cases” where a child’s best interests favour admitting further evidence. For instance, she observes that the need for “finality” and “order” may yield “in the interest of justice” in “urgent matters requiring an immediate decision” (para. 70).

[199]                     But, respectfully, my colleague’s approach — narrowing Palmer’s flexibility to “exceptional cases” — is unduly rigid and undermines the specificity needed in cases involving children’s welfare. Indeed, it would often deny judges the full context they need in order to make a sound determination of the best interests of the child in a particular case.

[200]                     Contrary to my colleague’s reasoning, all of the criteria must be applied flexibly in cases involving the best interests of children. I will briefly explain why this is so with respect to the first and fourth of the Palmer criteria — due diligence and whether the evidence could have affected the result at trial — as only these criteria are at issue in this appeal. I will then move on to apply Palmer — with the requisite flexibility — to the facts of this case.

A.           Palmer Test

(1)         Flexibility in Assessing Due Diligence

[201]                     Finality and order are not judicial straitjackets. Infants grow quickly into toddlers and then — in what may seem like the blink of an eye — into young adults. This development and maturation process demands that our courts have ample flexibility to decide each child custody case based on the most current information available. I could not agree more with the intervener the Office of the Children’s Lawyer that a flexible approach “recognizes the need to be aware of children’s updated circumstances to understand how appellate decisions will impact their current lives, not the lives they had when the original decision was made” (para. 6).

[202]                     With respect, my colleague takes a rigid view of due diligence. She focuses inordinately and narrowly on the “litigant’s conduct”, stating that parties should not be permitted to “benefit from their own inaction” (paras. 60‑61). She asserts that only in exceptional circumstances may courts admit evidence that does not meet the due diligence criterion. I respectfully disagree with this rigid approach for three reasons.

[203]                     First, I believe the reason for flexibility in this context to be obvious. It is to ensure that reviewing courts have the full context, given the ongoing nature of a child’s welfare — the undammed stream. This is precisely why appellate courts nationwide have held that due diligence is to be applied flexibly (Shortridge-Tsuchiya v. Tsuchiya, 2010 BCCA 61, 315 D.L.R. (4th) 498, at para. 87; Jiang v. Shi, 2017 BCCA 232, at para. 11 (CanLII); PT v. Alberta, 2019 ABCA 158, 88 Alta. L.R. (6th) 235, at para. 61; G (JD) v. G (SL), 2017 MBCA 117, [2018] 4 W.W.R. 543, at para. 39). These cases stand for a clear, principled proposition: the mere fact that new evidence could potentially have been obtained for the trial should not, on its own, preclude an appellate court from reviewing information that bears directly upon the welfare of a child (see, e.g., Babich v. Babich, 2020 SKCA 25; Bacic, at para. 24). Moreover, even if some of the evidence could have been adduced at trial, this does not end the Palmer analysis, as it is well established that a “failure to meet the due diligence criterion is not always fatal” (R. v. Lévesque, 2000 SCC 47, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 487, at para. 42). Where there has been such a failure, it must be determined whether the strength of the other Palmer criteria “is such that failure to satisfy the due diligence requirement is overborne” (ibid.). This clearly further supports my view that due diligence in the child custody context must be applied with greater flexibility than my colleague’s approach permits.

[204]                     Second, finality is a double-edged sword. My colleague is rightly concerned about the impact of protracted litigation on “women, [who] are often already shouldering the economic consequences of a marital breakdown” and who “will be unable to afford the financial and emotional cost of court proceedings” (para. 68). But she seems to overlook the fact that a strict application of due diligence would only add to the burden she describes. By requiring all family law litigants to “put their best foot forward at trial” (para. 60), my colleague would require a self‑represented single mother of modest means to advance her claim while simultaneously assembling up‑to‑date financial documentation, the relevance of which may not be apparent until after the initial hearing. Otherwise, this single mother runs the risk that new and potentially decisive evidence about her present circumstances will be ruled inadmissible. The result of my colleague’s approach to Palmer is that such a single mother would face a significant legal hurdle in pursuing custody of her children simply because she is unable to get her finances in order in a timely fashion. I fail to see how this promotes my colleague’s conception of “the interests of justice”.

[205]                     Third, I acknowledge that an application to vary may in some circumstances be the appropriate procedure. But an application to vary, like a motion to adduce further evidence on appeal, is “adversarial”. It would also place “additional strain on the parties’ resources” and generate further delays (para. 68). This begs the question: How does the variation mechanism mitigate the “financial and emotional” cost which so concerns my colleague? I do not find an answer for this in her reasons. Put simply, and with respect, my colleague’s conception of the due diligence criterion undercuts the interests of all family litigants, and “particularly women”, in child welfare cases (para. 68).

(2)         Flexibility in Assessing Whether the New Evidence Could Have Affected the Result

[206]                     The fourth Palmer criterion requires the court to ask whether the further evidence, if believed, could have affected the result.

[207]                     As with due diligence, however, flexibility is once again nowhere to be found in my colleague’s analysis. She does of course recite the definition of this criterion from Palmer and note that it must be approached “purposively”. But she leaves it to readers to discern for themselves what this might mean (para. 63).

[208]                     Such an approach fails to recognize that in Catholic Children’s Aid, this Court explicitly contemplated the need for flexibility in applying the fourth Palmer criterion. L’Heureux-Dubé J., writing for a unanimous Court, held as follows:

Counsel for the child supports the approach advanced by the respondent society and also relies on Genereux. . . as the appropriate test in matters where the best interests of the child are the paramount concern.

 

Although I doubt that Genereux. . . intended to depart significantly from the test of Palmer . . . its approach is to be commended. . . . If Genereux. . . has enlarged the scope of the admission of fresh evidence on appeal, it has done so, in the present case at least, with regard to the final arm of the [Palmer] test, that is, whether the fresh evidence may affect the result of the appeal when considered with the other evidence. If that is so, and the fact that the admission of up‑to‑date evidence is essential in cases such as the one at hand, Genereux. . . should be applied in cases determining the welfare of children. [Emphasis added; pp. 188‑89.]

[209]                     This excerpt affirms what is by now beyond dispute: the Palmer criteria — particularly the fourth criterion — are more flexible in appeals concerning the best interests of children, “where it is important to have the most current information possible ‘[g]iven the inevitable fluidity in a child’s development’” (K.K. v. M.M., 2022 ONCA 72, at para. 17 (CanLII) (text in brackets in original)).

[210]                     In light of the foregoing, I will now apply Palmer to the situation in the case at bar.

B.            Application of Palmer

[211]                     As I mentioned above, only the first and fourth of the Palmer criteria are in issue in this appeal. With respect to the first criterion, the mother argues that the new evidence could, with proper diligence, have been adduced at trial. In any event, relying on the fourth criterion, she contends that the new evidence could not have affected the outcome of the case.

[212]                     As I will explain, I disagree with the mother on both counts.

(1)         Due Diligence

[213]                     First, due diligence is not a barrier to admitting the new evidence. By its nature, the evidence could not have been adduced at trial. I acknowledge that the father could have acted more expeditiously in taking steps to address his financial situation and the condition of the family home, and in bringing these matters to the court’s attention. However, an inescapable fact remains: The evidence the father produced on appeal was not in existence at the time of the trial. The first Palmer factor therefore does not preclude its admission.

[214]                     Further, even if the evidence in question could have been obtained for the trial, this would not end the analysis. As I have indicated, giving effect to the need for flexibility in the child custody context demands that we apply the well‑established principle that due diligence is not a condition precedent to admission. Yet this is precisely how my colleague treats due diligence, contrary to this Court’s holding in Lévesque.

[215]                     Unlike my colleague, I do not accept that the existence of the variation procedure weighs against admission. She asserts that “[a] variation application and an appeal are distinct proceedings based on fundamentally different premises” (para. 75), and I agree with her. But in this case the father’s appeal would have gone ahead regardless of whether he brought a separate application to vary in the trial court. Hence, the mere existence of the possibility of a variation order does not foreclose a litigant’s right to appeal and therefore the right to present a motion to adduce additional evidence, particularly where the evidence in question is linked to the alleged error.

(2)         Whether the New Evidence Could Have Affected the Result

[216]                     Applying the fourth Palmer criterion, I conclude that the new evidence could have affected the result.

[217]                     It is noteworthy that my colleague does not even reach this branch of the Palmer test. She bases her conclusion on the father’s alleged lack of due diligence and on an absence of “circumstances” which might “render the admission of this evidence necessary in the interests of justice” (para. 91). All I would say in this regard is that I do not understand “necessity in the interests of justice” to be a Palmer criterion.

[218]                     More to the point, however, the fourth Palmer criterion favours admission of the new evidence. I say this for three reasons.

[219]                     First, the new evidence bears on a critical aspect of the trial judge’s reasoning. The trial judge found that the “parties’ financial situation, particularly as it pertains to the house”, was an issue that “significantly impact[ed]” his analysis of the children’s best interests (paras. 30‑31). It matters not in my view that this issue was comparatively less significant than the relationship between the parties. The trial judge devoted 10 paragraphs of his best interests analysis to the financial issues related to the West Kelowna home. It is thus plain that the new evidence, which suggests that the father’s financial position and the condition of the home are much improved, could have affected the trial judge’s ultimate conclusion on the question whether permitting the children to relocate with their mother was in their best interests.

[220]                     Second, the new evidence addresses concerns the trial judge had regarding the home environment the father would provide for the children. If believed, the new evidence suggests that the house is now much closer to a “living environment” than to a “working environment”, as it was described at the time of trial (para. 33). The new evidence indicates that the father has renovated the bathroom and the master bedroom, and has definite plans to complete the kitchen renovation.

[221]                     Finally, the new evidence undermines the trial judge’s conclusion that, given the father’s dire financial straits, his ability to remain in the West Kelowna home was “less than certain” (para. 40). The trial judge found that the father’s “plan to continue living in the house with the boys [was], for all practical purposes, entirely dependent on the willingness and ability of his parents to pay off the mortgage and the debt on the line of credit secured by the home, and finance the remainder of the renovations” (para. 39). As of the date of the trial, this was uncertain. His father had spoken with bankers about buying an interest in the home, but nothing concrete about this plan had been filed in evidence. If believed, the new evidence shows that the father’s plan has come to fruition.

[222]                     The best interests analysis is of course highly contextual and fact‑dependent. It is thus impossible to gauge exactly how this new evidence might have affected the trial judge’s carefully calibrated analysis. However, I agree with the father that the new evidence plainly bears on “one significant pillar” of the trial judge’s two-pronged rationale (R.F., at para. 67). In my view, this evidence could have altered the trial judge’s view that the children’s best interests would be better served by their living with their mother in Telkwa rather than in a shared parenting arrangement with both parents in the Kelowna area.

(3)         Conclusion on Palmer

[223]                     Accordingly, on a properly flexible application of Palmer, I would admit the new evidence. I see no reason why the interest in “finality and order”, to which my colleague refers numerous times, should have tied the Court of Appeal’s hands in admitting new evidence that was plainly relevant to the issues it had to decide in any event. I will now turn to the separate question of the proper use of that evidence.

C.            Proper Use of the New Evidence

[224]                     I agree with the Office of the Children’s Lawyer that the real concern with the new evidence in this appeal is not about appellate courts having up‑to‑date information on current circumstances which may affect a child’s best interests. Rather, it is about the use of new evidence by appellate courts without proper deference to lower courts, which is contrary to the principles developed by this Court in Van de Perre v. Edwards, 2001 SCC 60, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 1014. This issue should be dealt with separately from the admissibility analysis so as not to discourage the admission of new evidence about children’s current circumstances that may be invaluable to appellate courts.

[225]                     The parties agree that an appellate court admitting further evidence in child custody matters may use that evidence in one of two ways: (1) to justify remanding the matter to the trial court for reconsideration in light of a potentially material change in circumstances or (2) to make its own determination of the best interests of the child.

[226]                     The mother concedes that if the new evidence is admitted, “the matter should [be] remitted to the trial judge because. . . he ha[s] ‘extensive knowledge of this family and [these] child[ren]’” (A.F., at para. 71).

[227]                     I agree with the mother’s concession. In my view, while the Court of Appeal was correct to admit this evidence, it should not have used the new evidence regarding the father’s financial situation as a pretext to reweigh the trial judge’s findings regarding the relationship between the parties. Those findings were not affected by the new evidence and were entitled to appellate deference.

[228]                     As this Court held in Hickey v. Hickey, 1999 CanLII 691 (SCC), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 518, appellate courts are not entitled to overturn trial court decisions in family law matters “simply because [they] would have made a different decision or balanced the factors differently” (para. 12).

[229]                     The Court of Appeal accordingly erred in making its own determination based on the new evidence. Moreover, I agree with the father that finality, although important, should not tie the hands of a reviewing court so as to prevent it from crafting a remedy that would advance the best interests of the child. In this case, the new evidence bears directly — and perhaps decisively — on a matter of significance to the children’s welfare. Any additional delay and expense resulting from the reconsideration of this matter is justified by the need to assess whether it is in the children’s best interests to live closer to their father in his current circumstances. I would add that an application to vary in these circumstances would be pointless, since it would likewise, as was discussed above, involve further delay and expense to both parties.

III.         Disposition

[230]                     For the foregoing reasons, I would admit the new evidence and allow the appeal in part, with costs to the father in this Court and in the court below.

[231]                     In the result, I would remand the appeal to the trial court for reconsideration of the children’s best interests in light of the new evidence.

English version of the judgment of the Court delivered by

 

                  The Chief Justice —

I.               Introduction

[1]                             The crimes committed by the respondent in the Great Mosque of Québec on the fateful day of January 29, 2017 were of unspeakable horror and left deep and agonizing scars in the heart of the Muslim community and of Canadian society as a whole. We cannot help but feel sympathy for the victims and their loved ones for their irreparable losses and their indescribable pain.

[2]                             It is in the context of those crimes that this Court must rule on the constitutional limits on the state’s power to punish offenders. The appeal requires us to weigh fundamental values of our society enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and to reaffirm our commitment to upholding the rights it guarantees to every individual, including the vilest of criminals.

[3]                             More specifically, the question before the Court is whether s. 745.51 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 (“Cr. C.”), which was introduced in 2011 by the Protecting Canadians by Ending Sentence Discounts for Multiple Murders Act, S.C. 2011, c. 5, s. 5, is contrary to ss. 7 and 12 of the Charter. The impugned provision authorizes the imposition of consecutive parole ineligibility periods in cases involving multiple murders. In the context of first degree murders, the application of this provision allows a court to impose a sentence of imprisonment without eligibility for parole for a period of 50, 75, 100 or even 150 years. In practice, the exercise of the court’s discretion will inevitably result in imprisonment for life without a realistic possibility of parole for every offender concerned who has been convicted of multiple first degree murders. Such a criminal sentence is one whose severity is without precedent in this country’s history since the abolition of the death penalty and corporal punishment in the 1970s.

[4]                             For the reasons that follow, I conclude that s. 745.51 Cr. C. is contrary to s. 12 of the Charter and is not saved under s. 1. In light of this conclusion, it will not be necessary to consider the alleged infringement of s. 7 of the Charter.

[5]                             Section 12 of the Charter guarantees the right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment or treatment. In essence, its purpose is to protect human dignity and ensure respect for the inherent worth of each individual. This Court recently affirmed, albeit in a different context, that human dignity transcends the interests of the individual and concerns society at large (Sherman Estate v. Donovan, 2021 SCC 25, at para. 33). In this sense, the significance of this appeal extends well beyond its particular facts.

[6]                             Section 12 of the Charter prohibits the state from imposing a punishment that is grossly disproportionate in relation to the situation of a particular offender and from having recourse to punishments that, by their very nature, are intrinsically incompatible with human dignity.

[7]                             The provision challenged in this case allows the imposition of a sentence that falls into this latter category of punishments that are cruel and unusual by nature. All offenders subjected to stacked 25‑year ineligibility periods under s. 745.51 Cr. C. are doomed to be incarcerated for the rest of their lives without a realistic possibility of being granted parole. The impugned provision, taken to its extreme, authorizes a court to order an offender to serve an ineligibility period that exceeds the life expectancy of any human being, a sentence so absurd that it would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

[8]                             A sentence of imprisonment for life without a realistic possibility of parole is intrinsically incompatible with human dignity. Such a sentence is degrading insofar as it negates, in advance and irreversibly, the penological objective of rehabilitation. This objective is intimately linked to human dignity in that it conveys the conviction that every individual is capable of repenting and re‑entering society. This conclusion that a sentence of imprisonment for life without a realistic possibility of parole is incompatible with human dignity is not only reinforced by the effects that such a sentence may have on all offenders on whom it is imposed, but also finds support in international and comparative law.

[9]                             To ensure respect for the inherent dignity of every individual, s. 12 of the Charter requires that Parliament leave a door open for rehabilitation, even in cases where this objective is of secondary importance. In practical terms, this means that every inmate must have a realistic possibility of applying for parole, at the very least earlier than the expiration of an ineligibility period of 50 years, which is the minimum ineligibility period resulting from the exercise of judicial discretion under the impugned provision in cases involving first degree murders.

II.            Background and Judicial History

A.           Facts

[10]                        Given that these reasons concern the constitutionality of s. 745.51 Cr. C. and that the resulting principles will apply to many multiple murder cases, I do not think it would be appropriate to refer at length to the horrible circumstances of this case, which were summarized well by the trial judge and widely publicized in the media. However, out of respect for the victims of this tragedy, it must be said that hatred, racism, ignorance and Islamophobia were behind the appalling acts committed by the respondent on that fateful day of January 29, 2017, when he sowed terror and death in the Great Mosque of Québec.

[11]                        Forty‑six people, including four children, had gathered in that place of worship for evening prayer. The respondent burst in and, armed with a semi‑automatic rifle and a pistol, opened fire on the worshippers. In less than two minutes, he caused the death of six innocent people, Khaled Belkacemi, Ibrahima and Mamadou Tanou Barry, Abdelkrim Hassane, Azzeddine Soufiane and Aboubaker Thabti, seriously injured five others and left the survivors of the killings, and the victims’ loved ones, with deep and permanent psychological scars.

[12]                          On March 26, 2018, the respondent pleaded guilty to the 12 charges laid against him, including 6 counts of first degree murder, an indictable offence provided for in ss. 231(2) and 235 Cr. C. As a consequence, he was automatically sentenced to imprisonment for life. The Crown then asked the court to apply s. 745.51 Cr. C. and sentence the respondent to 6 consecutive parole ineligibility periods of 25 years, for a total of 150 years. The trial judge thus had to determine the length of the parole ineligibility period to be imposed on the respondent, and also had to rule on the constitutionality of s. 745.51 Cr. C.

B.            Quebec Superior Court, 2019 QCCS 354 (Huot J.)

[13]                          In particularly detailed reasons, the trial judge held that s. 745.51 Cr. C. infringed ss. 12 and 7 of the Charter and that it could not be saved under s. 1. As a remedy for the unconstitutionality of the provision, he applied the technique of reading in and ordered the respondent to serve an ineligibility period of 40 years before applying for parole.

[14]                          Before ruling on the constitutionality of the impugned provision, the trial judge first asked [translation] “whether there is a factual basis in this case to justify” such a constitutional analysis and concluded that there was (para. 472 (CanLII)). In his view, a certain parole ineligibility period had to be served consecutively having regard to the character of the respondent, the nature of the offences, the circumstances surrounding their commission, and the principles of sentencing. In this case, a period of more than 25 but less than 50 years would be appropriate. The judge noted, however, that s. 745.51 Cr. C. limited his exercise of discretion to the imposition of consecutive periods of 25 years each. He found that, in the circumstances, he had to review the constitutionality of the provision under ss. 7 and 12 of the Charter.

[15]                        To determine whether s. 745.51 Cr. C. created a sentence that constituted cruel and unusual punishment within the meaning of s. 12, the trial judge applied the analytical framework developed in R. v. Nur, 2015 SCC 15, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 773, although he observed that the impugned provision did not impose a minimum sentence (para. 810). He concluded at the first step of that analysis that, in the absence of the impugned provision, a total parole ineligibility period of between 35 and 42 years would be just and appropriate in this case (para. 843). At the second step of the analysis, which involves considering the effect of the prescribed sentence on the offender, he found that the imposition of 2 consecutive ineligibility periods of 25 years each would violate the respondent’s s. 12 rights and held that [translation] “[s]uch sentences are grossly disproportionate and totally incompatible with human dignity” (para. 980). In his view, Canadian society would consider any sentence that denied the offender a reasonable prospect of conditional release in the last years of his life to be abhorrent and intolerable. Section 745.51 Cr. C. would therefore result in the imposition of a grossly disproportionate sentence on the respondent and, for this reason, constituted cruel and unusual punishment.

[16]                          The trial judge then turned to the analysis under s. 7 of the Charter and concluded that the impugned provision was overbroad and had effects that were grossly disproportionate to its objective, thereby infringing the respondent’s liberty and security interests in a manner contrary to the principles of fundamental justice. In his analysis, he rejected the protection of hope as a principle of fundamental justice but found that fundamental justice does include the protection of human dignity, a principle that s. 745.51 Cr. C. violated.

[17]                        Regarding s. 1 of the Charter, the judge found that the Crown had not shown that the limits on the s. 7 and 12 rights were reasonable and justified in a free and democratic society.

[18]                        In the end, the judge noted that the appropriate remedy where a declaration of unconstitutionality is made is generally the invalidity of the legislative provision in question. However, he found that the impugned provision was substantially constitutional and peripherally problematic, so the defect could be remedied by applying the technique of reading in. In his view, because the violation stemmed from an omission from the provision, the essential conditions for reading in were met in this case. He therefore interpreted s. 745.51 Cr. C. as granting courts a discretion to choose the length of the additional ineligibility period to impose on an offender, which could be less than 25 years.

[19]                          The trial judge accordingly imposed on the respondent the mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment for life for the 6 counts of first degree murder and, applying the technique of reading in to s. 745.51 Cr. C., ordered that the respondent serve a 25‑year parole ineligibility period on each of the first 5 counts of which he had been convicted and that these periods be served concurrently. For the sixth count, the judge ordered that the respondent serve a minimum period of 15 years before being able to apply for parole and that this period be consecutive to the other periods he had ordered, for a total ineligibility period of 40 years.

C.            Quebec Court of Appeal, 2020 QCCA 1585, 405 C.C.C. (3d) 524 (Doyon, Gagnon and Bélanger JJ.A.)

[20]                          In a unanimous decision, the Court of Appeal allowed the respondent’s appeal, declared s. 745.51 Cr. C. invalid on the basis that it was contrary to ss. 12 and 7 of the Charter and found that the trial judge had erred by arrogating the discretion to reformulate s. 745.51 Cr. C. and, in so doing, ordering that the respondent serve a parole ineligibility period that had no basis in law.

[21]                        In its analysis under s. 12 of the Charter, the Court of Appeal began by considering the constitutionality of the provision by looking at various scenarios that might arise as a result of the application of s. 745.51 Cr. C. It concluded that the imposition of a parole ineligibility period that greatly exceeds the life expectancy of any human being is degrading because of its absurdity, and hence incompatible with human dignity. The Court of Appeal reached the same conclusion regarding the imposition of consecutive ineligibility periods totalling 75 years, an order that is unlikely to be carried out given that the minimum age at which an offender who started a sentence at the age of 18 could apply for parole would be 93. Likewise, the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 50 years does not satisfy the fundamental test of proportionality in sentencing. Although the Court of Appeal rejected the argument that loss of hope entails the unconstitutionality of the provision, it expressed the opinion that an individual who is rehabilitated after 25 years in prison must be able to apply for parole; if not, the sentence would have all the attributes of a totally disproportionate sentence. In the Court of Appeal’s view, the fact that the imposition of consecutive ineligibility periods is discretionary could not save s. 745.51 Cr. C., because in almost every case the sentence authorized by the section will be either grossly disproportionate or unacceptable by nature.

[22]                        Regarding s. 7 of the Charter, the Court of Appeal found that the impugned provision was overbroad and that its effects were disproportionate, as could be seen from the s. 12 analysis. However, the court declined to answer the question whether the protection of human dignity is a principle of fundamental justice.

[23]                        The possibility of imposing consecutive 25‑year periods was not a minimal impairment of the Charter rights and was not justified in a free and democratic society within the meaning of s. 1. Given the constitutional invalidity of the provision, the Court of Appeal addressed the appropriate remedy and concluded that reading in was inappropriate in this case. The means chosen by Parliament — the fixed periods of 25 years — were so inextricably bound up with the legislative objectives that they could not be disregarded without unduly intruding on the legislative sphere. In the Court of Appeal’s view, the trial judge had usurped Parliament’s role in interpreting the provision as granting courts a discretion to choose the appropriate parole ineligibility period.

[24]                        The Court of Appeal accordingly declared s. 745.51 Cr. C. unconstitutional, noting that the declaration was to take effect immediately, and ordered that the respondent serve a 25‑year parole ineligibility period on each count and that these periods be served concurrently.

III.         Issues

[25]                        This appeal raises the following issues:

1.            Does s. 745.51 Cr. C. infringe s. 12 of the Charter?

2.            Does s. 745.51 Cr. C. infringe s. 7 of the Charter?

3.            If s. 12 or s. 7 is infringed, can the impugned provision be saved under s. 1 of the Charter?

4.            In the event that the impugned provision cannot be saved under s. 1 of the Charter, what is the appropriate remedy?

[26]                        For the reasons that follow, I am of the view that s. 745.51 Cr. C. infringes s. 12 of the Charter and cannot be saved under s. 1. In light of this conclusion, there is no need to consider the alleged infringement of s. 7 of the Charter. The provision must be declared to be of no force or effect retroactively to the time it was enacted.

IV.         Analysis

A.           History of Section 745.51 Cr. C.

[27]                        It is helpful to begin the analysis by outlining the manner in which the treatment of people convicted of murder in Canada has changed over time, since these changes inform our understanding of the impugned provision.

[28]                        Until 1961, there was no legal classification of types of murder in this country. Any person convicted of murder was sentenced to death, and the sentence was carried out unless the Governor General, acting on the advice of Cabinet, commuted it to life imprisonment. In actual fact, the royal prerogative of mercy was exercised frequently and operated flexibly at that time (Library of Parliament, Bill S‑6: An Act to amend the Criminal Code and another Act, Legislative Summary 40‑3‑S6‑E, April 30, 2010, at pp. 4‑5; Correctional Service of Canada, A review and estimate of time spent in prison by offenders sentenced for murder, November 2002 (online)).

[29]                        In 1961, Parliament established a distinction between capital murder and non‑capital murder. The former, which included murder that was planned and deliberate, was punishable by death by hanging in the case of an offender 18 years of age or older. The latter, which was similar to second degree murder, was punishable by imprisonment for life (Act to amend the Criminal Code (Capital Murder), S.C. 1960‑61, c. 44, ss. 1 and 2; Library of Parliament, at pp. 5‑6).

[30]                        From 1961 to 1976, offenders whose sentences had been commuted and those whose crimes fell into the second category — non‑capital murder — could apply for parole following a minimum period of incarceration (Correctional Service of Canada).

[31]                        In July 1976, Parliament abolished the death penalty for Criminal Code offences (Criminal Law Amendment Act (No. 2), 1976, S.C. 1974‑75‑76, c. 105).[1] As a result of a political compromise, it replaced the death penalty with a mandatory minimum life sentence for the two categories of murder now defined in the Criminal Code: first degree murder and second degree murder. In the case of second degree murder, the parole ineligibility period varied from 10 to 25 years. For first degree murder, the parole ineligibility period was 25 years without regard to the number of victims. There was no provision at that time concerning the imposition of consecutive ineligibility periods in cases involving multiple murders.

[32]                        The mandatory 25‑year parole ineligibility period for first degree murder was presumably established to satisfy proponents of the death penalty (A. Manson, “The Easy Acceptance of Long Term Confinement in Canada” (1990), 79 C.R. (3d) 265, at p. 266). Indeed, it was particularly severe when compared with the ineligibility periods provided for in other Western countries at the time for similar offences (Manson, at pp. 266‑67). Moreover, from 1961 to 1976, the average time served in prison for the offence of capital murder had been 15.8 years, well below the newly enacted 25‑year period of imprisonment (Correctional Service of Canada).

[33]                        When the death penalty was abolished, Parliament also established a right to judicial review of the parole ineligibility period, commonly known as the “faint hope” clause (Criminal Law Amendment Act (No. 2), 1976, s. 21). This clause allowed persons who had been sentenced to life in prison for first or second degree murder without eligibility for parole for more than 15 years to apply for a review of their parole ineligibility period once they had been incarcerated for at least 15 years. The clause was added to the Criminal Code in the hope of encouraging the rehabilitation of offenders serving long prison sentences and, as a result, of creating a safer prison environment. As well, it tempered the increased harshness of parole ineligibility periods (Department of Justice Canada, An Analysis of the Use of the Faint Hope Clause (2010), at p. 1; Library of Parliament, at pp. 3‑4).

[34]                        In 1996, Parliament amended the faint hope clause such that, among other things, persons convicted of multiple murders would no longer be able to apply for judicial review (An Act to amend the Criminal Code (judicial review of parole ineligibility) and another Act, S.C. 1996, c. 34). Then, in 2011, Parliament passed legislation that abolished the clause for all intents and purposes by making it inapplicable to anyone who committed a murder on or after the day on which the legislation came into force (An Act to amend the Criminal Code and another Act, S.C. 2011, c. 2).

[35]                        The impugned provision was also introduced into the Criminal Code in 2011 (Protecting Canadians by Ending Sentence Discounts for Multiple Murders Act, s. 5). The relevant subsection of s. 745.51 Cr. C. reads as follows:

      745.51 (1) At the time of the sentencing under section 745 of an offender who is convicted of murder and who has already been convicted of one or more other murders, the judge who presided at the trial of the offender or, if that judge is unable to do so, any judge of the same court may, having regard to the character of the offender, the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission, and the recommendation, if any, made pursuant to section 745.21, by order, decide that the periods without eligibility for parole for each murder conviction are to be served consecutively.

[36]                          Given the fact that the impugned provision concerns the imposition of consecutive parole ineligibility periods, a discussion of the parole system is in order. It should be noted, however, that this appeal does not relate to the process by which an offender may apply for parole at the end of the ineligibility period.

B.            The Parole System in Canada

[37]                          The parole system involves a process that is independent of and distinct from the sentencing process (Canada (Attorney General) v. Whaling, 2014 SCC 20, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 392, at para. 1). Before this system was set up in the last century, there was no general sentence review mechanism in Canada. During the pre‑Confederation period, the only relief an offender could obtain was the reduction of a prison sentence or commutation of a death sentence by way of the royal prerogative of mercy (D. P. Cole and A. Manson, Release from Imprisonment: The Law of Sentencing, Parole and Judicial Review (1990), at p. 159).

[38]                        In 1868, The Penitentiary Act of 1868, S.C. 1868, c. 75, s. 62, introduced a sentence remission mechanism that enabled prisoners to obtain a reduction in the length of their sentence upon proof of good behaviour (Cole and Manson, at p. 163). But it was not until 1899 that the first administrative parole mechanism came into existence through the enactment of what was known as the Ticket of Leave Act (An Act to provide for the Conditional Liberation of Penitentiary Convicts, S.C. 1899, c. 49), under which prisoners who met the eligibility criteria could be conditionally released (Cole and Manson, at pp. 164‑66).

[39]                        In the 1950s, Parliament appointed an advisory committee to inquire into the use of the royal prerogative of mercy and into the parole system (Department of Justice Canada, Report of a Committee Appointed to Inquire Into the Principles and Procedures Followed in the Remission Service of the Department of Justice of Canada (1956) (“Fauteux Report”)). The committee made its recommendations in 1956, and the most important of them were implemented in 1958 through the enactment of the first modern parole legislation, the Parole Act, S.C. 1958, c. 38. That Act created an independent agency, now known as the Parole Board of Canada (“Board”), that had the power to review and vary conditions for release. Major amendments were made to the Parole Act in 1977, the year after the death penalty was abolished. The Board’s role and functions were expanded at that time (Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1977, S.C. 1976‑1977, c. 53). Finally, the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, S.C. 1992, c. 20 (“Conditional Release Act”), was passed in 1992 to replace, among others, the Parole Act. The Conditional Release Act defines the purpose of and principles underlying conditional release, and gives particular prominence to the protection of society by making it the paramount consideration.

[40]                        The Board is an independent administrative tribunal whose primary role is to make decisions on conditional release (Conditional Release Act, ss. 103 and 107). It has exclusive jurisdiction to grant day parole and full parole to persons serving a sentence of two years or more in Canada (ss. 122 and 123(1)). Offenders with fixed‑term sentences are generally eligible to apply for full parole after serving the lesser of one third of their sentence and seven years (s. 120(1)). That being said, offenders who have been convicted of first or second degree murder are not eligible for full parole until they have served 25 years or 10 to 25 years, respectively, of their sentence (s. 745(a) and (c) Cr. C.).

[41]                          There is no guarantee that offenders will be granted parole when their ineligibility period expires (R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, at para. 34; M. E. Campbell and D. Cole, “Sentencing and Parole for Persons Convicted of Murder”, in D. Cole and J. Roberts, eds., Sentencing in Canada: Essays in Law, Policy and Practice (2020), 183, at pp. 185‑87). Offenders must prove to the Board that they no longer represent a danger to society and that it is therefore no longer necessary to keep them in custody (Conditional Release Act, s. 102). Parole is a statutory privilege and not a right (Nur, at para. 98).

[42]                          The Board exercises a discretion when it makes a decision with respect to parole. In exercising that discretion, the Board is guided by its purpose: “to contribute to the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by means of decisions on the timing and conditions of release that will best facilitate the rehabilitation of offenders and their reintegration into the community as law‑abiding citizens” (Conditional Release Act, s. 100; see also Nur, at para. 98). The Conditional Release Act’s primary emphasis is on protecting the public (see R. v. Zinck, 2003 SCC 6, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 41, at para. 19), and since 2012 this concern has been formally recognized as the paramount consideration in decisions on release (Safe Streets and Communities Act, S.C. 2012, c. 1; Conditional Release Act, s. 100.1).

[43]                        The Board’s broad discretion means that it may attach conditions to an offender’s release (Conditional Release Act, s. 133(3)), including to protect victims who have safety concerns (s. 133(3.1)). The Board may also suspend or revoke the parole of an offender who breaches the conditions imposed (s. 135). Where the Board decides not to grant parole, it generally reviews the case every two years (s. 123(5)). However, this is done only every five years in the case of offenders who have been convicted of murder or another offence involving violence (s. 123(5.01)).

[44]                          Victims are taken into consideration in the parole process. To determine whether an offender presents an “undue risk to society” (Conditional Release Act, s. 102), the Board is to consider, among other things, the nature and gravity of the offence as well as information obtained from victims (s. 101(a)). Victims may apply to attend parole hearings and may present statements to the Board (s. 140(4), (5.1), (5.2) and (10) to (12)). Although such hearings can awaken painful memories for victims and for their loved ones, they do serve to reiterate the suffering an offender has caused and to condemn the acts committed once again (D. Spencer, “How Multiple Murder Sentencing Provisions May Violate the Charter” (2019), 55 C.R. (7th) 165).

C.            Sentencing Objectives in Canadian Law

[45]                        Before I begin the s. 12 analysis, an overview of the objectives of sentencing will be essential to the adjudication of the case before the Court. In Canadian law, the fundamental purpose of sentencing is to protect society and to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more objectives, including denunciation, deterrence and rehabilitation, which it will be helpful to discuss (s. 718 Cr. C.).

[46]                        First of all, the penological objective of denunciation requires that a sentence express society’s condemnation of the offence that was committed. The sentence is the means by which society communicates its moral values (R. v. M. (C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 81). This objective must be weighed carefully, as it could, on its own, be used to justify sentences of unlimited severity (C. C. Ruby, Sentencing (10th ed. 2020), at §1.22).

[47]                        As for the objective of deterrence, it has two forms. The first, specific deterrence, is meant to discourage the offender before the court from reoffending. The second, general deterrence, is intended to discourage members of the public who might be tempted to engage in the criminal activity for which the offender has been convicted (R. v. B.W.P., 2006 SCC 27, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 941, at para. 2). When this objective is being pursued, the offender is punished more harshly in order to send a message to the public or, in other words, to serve as an example. General deterrence is an objective that must be weighed by a court, but the effectiveness of which has often been questioned. These legitimate reservations notwithstanding, the fact remains that the certainty of punishment, together with the entire range of criminal sanctions, does produce a certain deterrent effect, albeit one that is difficult to evaluate, on possible offenders (Ruby, at §1.31; Canadian Sentencing Commission, Sentencing Reform: A Canadian Approach (1987), at pp. 136‑38).

[48]                        Lastly, the objective of rehabilitation is designed to reform offenders with a view to their reintegration into society so that they can become law‑abiding citizens. This penological objective presupposes that offenders are capable of gaining control over their lives and improving themselves, which ultimately leads to a better protection of society. M. Manning and P. Sankoff note that rehabilitation “is probably the most economical in the long run and the most humanitarian objective of punishment” (Manning, Mewett & Sankoff: Criminal Law (5th ed. 2015), at ¶1.155). Along the same lines, I would reiterate my comment in R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, that “[r]ehabilitation is one of the fundamental moral values that distinguish Canadian society from the societies of many other nations in the world” (para. 4).

[49]                        The relative importance of each of the sentencing objectives varies with the nature of the crime and the characteristics of the offender (R. v. Lyons, 1987 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at p. 329). There is no mathematical formula for determining what constitutes a just and appropriate sentence. That is why this Court has described sentencing as a “delicate art which attempts to balance carefully the societal goals of sentencing against the moral blameworthiness of the offender and the circumstances of the offence, while at all times taking into account the needs and current conditions of and in the community” (M. (C.A.), at para. 91).

[50]                        But sentencing must in all circumstances be guided by the cardinal principle of proportionality. The sentence must be severe enough to denounce the offence but must not exceed “what is just and appropriate, given the moral blameworthiness of the offender and the gravity of the offence” (R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, at para. 42; see also R. v. Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433, at para. 37). Proportionality in sentencing is considered to be an essential factor in maintaining public confidence in the fairness and rationality of the criminal justice system. The application of this principle assures the public that the offender deserves the punishment received (Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, 1985 CanLII 81 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at p. 533, per Wilson J., concurring).

[51]                        It follows that “a person cannot be made to suffer a grossly disproportionate punishment simply to send a message to discourage others from offending” (Nur, at para. 45). In a similar vein, Vauclair J.A. aptly stated that [translation] “striving for exemplarity to the detriment of evidence of the merit of rehabilitation objectives is incompatible with the principle of individualization” (Lacelle Belec v. R., 2019 QCCA 711, at para. 30 (CanLII), citing R. v. Paré, 2011 QCCA 2047, at para. 48 (CanLII), per Doyon J.A.). Proportionality has a restraining function, and in this sense serves to guarantee that a sentence is individualized, just and appropriate.

[52]                        The principle of proportionality is so fundamental that it has a constitutional dimension under s. 12 of the Charter, which forbids the imposition of a sentence that is so grossly disproportionate as to be incompatible with human dignity (Nasogaluak, at para. 41; Ipeelee, at para. 36). However, proportionality as a sentencing principle has no constitutional status as such, since it is not recognized to be a principle of fundamental justice under s. 7 of the Charter (R. v. Malmo‑Levine, 2003 SCC 74, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 571, at para. 160; R. v. Safarzadeh‑Markhali, 2016 SCC 14, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 180, at para. 71).

[53]                        Nor do the other sentencing principles and objectives have their own constitutional status. It follows that “Parliament is entitled to modify and abrogate them as it sees fit, subject only to s. 12 of the Charter” (Safarzadeh‑Markhali, at para. 71).

D.           The Right Under Section 12 of the Charter Not to Be Subjected to Cruel and Unusual Punishment

[54]                        Section 12 of the Charter, which appears under the heading “Legal Rights”, provides that “[e]veryone has the right not to be subjected to any cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.” Although these reasons apply to both punishment and treatment, I will, for the sake of brevity, refer solely to punishment.

[55]                        It will therefore be appropriate, first, to determine whether the parole ineligibility period constitutes punishment and, second, to clarify the two prongs of the protection afforded by this constitutional guarantee.

(1)         The Parole Ineligibility Period Constitutes Punishment

[56]                        Section 12 of the Charter grants individuals a right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. A precondition for applying this section is therefore that the impugned action constitute punishment. Such is the case here.

[57]                        State action is considered to be punishment for the purposes of s. 12 if it “(1) . . . is a consequence of conviction that forms part of the arsenal of sanctions to which an accused may be liable in respect of a particular offence, and either (2) . . . is imposed in furtherance of the purpose and principles of sentencing, or (3) . . . has a significant impact on an offender’s liberty or security interests” (R. v. Boudreault, 2018 SCC 58, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 599, at para. 39, quoting R. v. K.R.J., 2016 SCC 31, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 906, at para. 41).

[58]                        The length of parole ineligibility is part of an offender’s punishment (Shropshire, at para. 23; see also Zinck, at para. 31). It is a consequence of conviction and has a significant impact on the offender’s interests in liberty and security of the person. What is more, the parole ineligibility period furthers the objectives of denunciation and deterrence that underlie a sentence (Shropshire, at paras. 21‑23; M. (C.A.), at para. 64; R. v. Simmonds, 2018 BCCA 205, 362 C.C.C. (3d) 215, at para. 10). It follows that the imposition of consecutive parole ineligibility periods authorized by s. 745.51 Cr. C. constitutes punishment, the constitutionality of which must be determined under s. 12 of the Charter.

(2)         The Two Prongs of the Right Not to Be Subjected to Cruel and Unusual Punishment

[59]                        For a proper understanding of the two prongs of the protection afforded by s. 12 of the Charter, it is necessary to refocus the analysis on the purpose of this provision. This Court recently stated that the purpose of s. 12 is “to prevent the state from inflicting physical or mental pain and suffering through degrading and dehumanizing treatment or punishment. It is meant to protect human dignity and respect the inherent worth of individuals” (Quebec (Attorney General) v. 9147‑0732 Québec inc., 2020 SCC 32, at para. 51; the Court was unanimous on this point). Although dignity is not recognized as an independent constitutional right, it is a fundamental value that serves as a guide for the interpretation of all Charter rights (Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), 2000 SCC 44, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 307, at para. 77). Generally speaking, the concept of dignity evokes the idea that every person has intrinsic worth and is therefore entitled to respect (Ward v. Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse), 2021 SCC 43, at para. 56; Quebec (Public Curator) v. Syndicat national des employés de l’hôpital St‑Ferdinand, 1996 CanLII 172 (SCC), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 211, at para. 105). This respect is owed to every individual, irrespective of their actions (see C. Brunelle, “La dignité dans la Charte des droits et libertés de la personne: de l’ubiquité à l’ambiguïté d’une notion fondamentale”, [2006] R. du B. (numéro thématique) 143, at pp. 150‑51).

[60]                        Against this backdrop, the two prongs of the right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment may now be considered. Section 12 protects, first, against the imposition of a punishment that is so excessive as to be incompatible with human dignity and, second, against the imposition of a punishment that is intrinsically incompatible with human dignity (R. v. Smith, 1987 CanLII 64 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045, at pp. 1072‑74; L. Kerr and B. L. Berger, “Methods and Severity: The Two Tracks of Section 12” (2020), 94 S.C.L.R. (2d) 235, at pp. 235‑36). This distinction is often blurred, and it would be helpful in the context of this appeal to clarify certain points in this regard.

[61]                        The first form of cruel and unusual punishment involves punishment whose effect is grossly disproportionate to what would have been appropriate (Smith, at p. 1072). A punishment oversteps constitutional limits when it is grossly disproportionate, and not merely excessive (Smith, at p. 1072). A grossly disproportionate sentence is cruel and unusual in that it shows the state’s complete disregard for the specific circumstances of the sentenced individual and for the proportionality of the punishment inflicted on them.

[62]                        Determining whether a punishment is grossly disproportionate requires a contextual and comparative analysis: a punishment is found to be so in the specific circumstances of a particular case, in relation to the punishment that would have been just and appropriate having regard to the offender’s personal characteristics and the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence. However, the nature of the punishment inflicted is not problematic from a constitutional perspective. For example, it is accepted that the state may have recourse to fixed‑term imprisonment or to the imposition of a fine as punishment. Such punishment is therefore not in itself cruel and unusual, but can become so if its effects make it grossly disproportionate.

[63]                        The case law on grossly disproportionate punishment has been developed in the context of mandatory sentences imposed without regard for the offender’s particular circumstances (e.g., mandatory minimum prison sentences in R. v. Lloyd, 2016 SCC 13, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 130; Nur; R. v. Ferguson, 2008 SCC 6, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 96; R. v. Luxton, 1990 CanLII 83 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 711; Smith; a mandatory victim surcharge in Boudreault; a mandatory weapons prohibition order in R. v. Wiles, 2005 SCC 84, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 895). In Nur, this Court noted that, to determine whether a minimum sentence is grossly disproportionate, a court must first consider “what constitutes a proportionate sentence for the offence having regard to the objectives and principles of sentencing in the Criminal Code” (para. 46). The court must then ask whether the impugned provision requires it to impose a sentence that is grossly disproportionate to one that would be just and appropriate for the offender or for another offender in a reasonable hypothetical case; if the provision does so, it infringes s. 12 of the Charter (Nur, at para. 46). The Nur framework does not apply to discretionary sentences. Where there is no mandatory minimum sentence, the imposition of a sentence that is acceptable by its nature but that proves to be disproportionate in a particular case can be rectified by way of an appeal against sentence rather than a declaration of unconstitutionality (Malmo‑Levine, at paras. 167‑68).

[64]                        The second prong of the protection afforded by s. 12 concerns a narrow class of punishments that are cruel and unusual by nature; these punishments will “always be grossly disproportionate” because they are intrinsically incompatible with human dignity (Smith, at p. 1073). These punishments are in themselves contrary to human dignity because of their “degrading and dehumanizing” nature, as this Court put it in 9147‑0732 Québec inc. (para. 51; the Court was unanimous on this point). A degrading or dehumanizing punishment, by its very nature, outrages “our standards of decency” (Luxton, at p. 724).

[65]                        Since a society’s standards of decency are not frozen in time, what constitutes punishment that is cruel and unusual by nature will necessarily evolve, in accordance with the principle that our Constitution is a living tree capable of growth and expansion within its natural limits so as to meet the new social, political and historical realities of the modern world (Reference re Same‑Sex Marriage, 2004 SCC 79, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 698, at para. 22; Hunter v. Southam Inc., 1984 CanLII 33 (SCC), [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at pp. 155‑56; Edwards v. Attorney‑General for Canada, 1929 CanLII 438 (UK JCPC), [1930] A.C. 124 (P.C.), at p. 136). As Cory J. pointed out more than 30 years ago while dissenting on another point in Kindler v. Canada (Minister of Justice), 1991 CanLII 78 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 779, “[w]hat is acceptable as punishment to a society will vary with the nature of that society, its degree of stability and its level of maturity” (p. 818). Punishments that we regard as incompatible with human dignity today were common and accepted in the past. Professor A. N. Doob rightly states that “[t]he reason we no longer whip or hang people is not that we ran out of leather or rope. Rather, it is because those punishments are no longer congruent with Canadian values” (Department of Justice Canada, A Values and Evidence Approach to Sentencing Purposes and Principles (2017), at p. 4).

[66]                        Among the punishments and treatments that have so far been held to be intrinsically incompatible with human dignity are “the infliction of corporal punishment, such as the lash, irrespective of the number of lashes imposed . . . the lobotomisation of certain dangerous offenders or the castration of sexual offenders” (Smith, at p. 1074). Torture also falls into this category, for it has as its end “the denial of a person’s humanity” (Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 SCC 1, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3, at para. 51).

[67]                        A punishment is cruel and unusual by nature if the court is convinced that, having regard to its nature and effects, it could never be imposed in a manner consonant with human dignity in the Canadian criminal context. A punishment that is cruel and unusual by nature is “so inherently repugnant that it could never be an appropriate punishment, however egregious the offence” (Suresh, at para. 51). To determine whether a punishment is intrinsically incompatible with dignity, the court must determine whether the punishment is, by its very nature, degrading or dehumanizing. The effects that the punishment may have on all offenders on whom it is imposed can also inform the court and provide support for its analysis of the nature of the punishment.

[68]                        The court’s analysis must remain focused on the nature of the punishment rather than on considerations of proportionality between the punishment and the offender’s moral culpability. A punishment that is cruel and unusual by nature will by definition “always be grossly disproportionate” (Smith, at p. 1073). Such a punishment must quite simply be excluded from the arsenal of sanctions available to the state, which means that the state cannot circumvent s. 12 by providing for specific exemptions for the imposition of the punishment or by making its imposition subject to judicial discretion. In other words, the mere possibility that a punishment that is cruel and unusual by nature may be imposed is enough to infringe s. 12 of the Charter.

[69]                        In sum, a punishment may infringe s. 12 for two distinct reasons, either because it is grossly disproportionate in a given case or because it is intrinsically incompatible with human dignity. Where both prongs of the protection of s. 12 are in issue in the same case, the analysis of the nature of the punishment must precede that of gross disproportionality. If the punishment that might be imposed is cruel and unusual by nature, and hence intrinsically incompatible with human dignity, it will be unnecessary — and I would even say pointless — to consider whether it is grossly disproportionate in a given case, because a punishment that is cruel and unusual by nature will “always be grossly disproportionate” (Smith, at p. 1073; see also Kerr and Berger, at p. 238).

[70]                        In their analysis under s. 12 of the Charter, the courts must show deference to Parliament’s policy decisions with respect to sentencing (Lloyd, at para. 45). The limit set by the Constitution for a sentence to be found grossly disproportionate is intended to be demanding and will be attained only rarely (Boudreault, at para. 45; Lloyd, at para. 24; Steele v. Mountain Institution, 1990 CanLII 50 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1385, at p. 1417; Lyons, at p. 345). Likewise, the courts must be cautious and deferential when a sentence is contested on the basis that it falls into the narrow category of punishment that is cruel and unusual by nature. Nevertheless, “the final judgment as to whether a punishment exceeds constitutional limits set by the Charter is properly a judicial function” (Lloyd, at para. 45, quoting R. v. Guiller (1985), 48 C.R. (3d) 226 (Ont. Dist. Ct.), at p. 238). That is the analysis we must now undertake.

E.            Does Section 745.51 Cr. C. Infringe Section 12 of the Charter?

[71]                        I will begin by observing that this appeal concerns only the constitutionality, under s. 12 of the Charter, of a provision that allows a court to impose consecutive parole ineligibility periods in a context involving multiple murders. Specifically, in the case of first degree murders, the court is authorized, through the combined effect of ss. 745.51 and 745(a) Cr. C., to add up ineligibility periods of 25 years for each murder. Whether it is unconstitutional for a court to impose any ineligibility period greater than 25 years is therefore not at issue in this case.

[72]                        To answer the question before the Court, I will begin by defining the scope of s. 745.51 Cr. C. and the punishment that flows from it. I will then inquire into the nature of that punishment to determine whether it is intrinsically incompatible with human dignity and thus cruel and unusual by nature. To support my analysis of the nature of the punishment, I will consider the potential effects of the punishment on all offenders and I will also look at international and comparative law. I will finish on this topic by discussing whether the judicial discretion and the royal prerogative of mercy affect the constitutionality of the impugned provision.

[73]                        For the reasons that follow, I conclude that, by allowing consecutive 25‑year parole ineligibility periods to be imposed in cases involving first degree murders, s. 745.51 Cr. C. authorizes the imposition of sentences of imprisonment for life without a realistic possibility of parole before death for all offenders who must serve such periods consecutively. Such sentences are degrading in nature and thus incompatible with human dignity, because they deny offenders any possibility of reintegration into society, which presupposes, definitively and irreversibly, that they lack the capacity to reform and re‑enter society. The conclusion that a sentence of imprisonment without a realistic possibility of parole is incompatible with human dignity is supported by an analysis of the effects that such a sentence may have on all offenders on whom it is imposed, as well as by a review of international and comparative law. Finally, the judicial discretion cannot save the impugned provision, and the royal prerogative of mercy does not offer a realistic possibility of release for an individual serving a sentence of imprisonment for which there is no other review mechanism.

(1)         Scope of Section 745.51 Cr. C.

[74]                        An accused who is convicted of first or second degree murder will be sentenced to imprisonment for life (s. 235(2) Cr. C.) and will be eligible for full parole only after serving an ineligibility period of, respectively, 25 years or 10 to 25 years (s. 745(a) and (c) Cr. C.). Section 745.51 Cr. C. provides that the judge who presided at the trial may, by order, decide that the periods without eligibility for parole for each murder conviction are to be served consecutively, in a departure from the general principle that parole ineligibility periods are to be served concurrently (ss. 718.2(c) and 718.3(4) Cr. C.). According to the interpretation proposed by the parties — which we will assume to be correct for the purposes of this appeal, insofar as it is not determinative — s. 745.51 Cr. C. applies regardless of whether the multiple murders were committed at the same time or during separate events, and it applies in the absence of a previous conviction.

[75]                        I agree with the trial judge and the Court of Appeal in this case that s. 745.51 Cr. C. does not authorize a court to order that an offender convicted of first degree murder serve only a portion of a 25‑year ineligibility period consecutively to another period imposed for another first degree murder (Sup. Ct. reasons, at para. 824; C.A. reasons, at para. 64). The provision in question allows only the imposition of consecutive 25‑year periods. Parliament’s intention, which I will discuss below, was clear on this point. I would add that s. 745.51 Cr. C. sets no ceiling for the total length of the ineligibility period a court may impose. This provision merely states the criteria that are to guide the court in exercising its discretion, to which I will return later in these reasons.

[76]                        In the case of multiple first degree murders, the impugned provision authorizes the imposition of sentences of imprisonment that effectively deprive all offenders who receive such sentences of a realistic possibility of being granted parole. In the scenario that is most favourable to the Crown, but that would in fact be quite rare, an 18‑year‑old offender who goes to prison and remains there for the next 50 years of their life could theoretically be paroled at the age of 68. For reference, it should be noted that the average life expectancy of inmates who die of natural causes is about 60 years (Office of the Correctional Investigator of Canada and Canadian Human Rights Commission, Aging and Dying in Prison: An Investigation into the Experiences of Older Individuals in Federal Custody (2019), at p. 57), which is far lower than the average life expectancy of the general public (for context, the average life expectancy of Canadians, both sexes combined, was 81.7 years in 2020; see Statistics Canada, “Deaths, 2020”, in The Daily, January 24, 2022 (online)).

[77]                        Therefore, at the end of the 50‑year period of incarceration, some offenders will have died, while others will perhaps be released after the significant years of their life are over, making them what some authors have called “virtual lifers” (A. Iftene, “R. c. Bissonnette and the (Un)Constitutionality of Consecutive Periods of Parole Ineligibility for a Life Sentence: Why the QCCA Got It Right and Why Section 745.51 Should Never Be Re‑Written” (2021), 69 Crim. L.Q. 312, at p. 331). For the purposes of analyzing the constitutionality of the impugned provision, this situation can be likened to a sentence of imprisonment for life without a realistic possibility of parole, in that the individual in question will never be able to re‑enter society and contribute to it as an active citizen, especially given the fact that long prison sentences impair, more than they favour, the reintegration of offenders into society (R. v. Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, at paras. 54‑57; Ruby, at §1.63).

[78]                        As for the other possible cases, which involve the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for life without eligibility for parole for 75, 100, 125 or even 800 years, the conclusion is self‑evident: the individual is sentenced to die in prison, deprived of any possibility of one day recovering a portion of their liberty.

[79]                        Such cases are far from being hypothetical, as can be seen from the jurisprudence. In R. v. Bourque, 2014 NBQB 237, 427 N.B.R. (2d) 259, for example, a 24‑year‑old accused was sentenced to imprisonment for life with no possibility of applying for parole before the expiration of a 75‑year ineligibility period (see also R. v. Saretzky, 2017 ABQB 496; R. v. Ostamas, 2016 MBQB 136, 329 Man. R. (2d) 203).

[80]                        I will therefore analyze the constitutionality of the impugned provision on the basis that it effectively authorizes the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for life without a realistic possibility of parole.

(2)         Imprisonment for Life Without a Realistic Possibility of Parole Constitutes Punishment That Is Cruel and Unusual by Nature

[81]                        An examination of the nature of a sentence of imprisonment for life without a realistic possibility of parole leads to the conclusion that it is incompatible with human dignity, a value that underlies the protection conferred by s. 12 of the Charter. This punishment is degrading in nature in that it presupposes at the time of its imposition, in a definitive and irreversible way, that the offender is beyond redemption and lacks the moral autonomy needed for rehabilitation. This alone justifies the conclusion that this punishment is cruel and unusual by nature. It will nonetheless be helpful to review in addition the effects that this sentence may have on all offenders on whom it is imposed.

(a)           Examination of the Nature of a Sentence of Imprisonment for Life Without a Realistic Possibility of Parole

[82]                        A sentence of imprisonment for life without a realistic possibility of parole is different in nature from a sentence of incarceration for which a review mechanism exists, in that the former deprives the offender of any prospect of reforming and re‑entering society (see Lyons, at pp. 340‑41; I. Grant, C. Choi and D. Parkes, “The Meaning of Life: A Study of the Use of Parole Ineligibility for Murder Sentencing” (2020), 52 Ottawa L. Rev. 133, at p. 172, citing A. Liebling, “Moral performance, inhuman and degrading treatment and prison pain” (2011), 13 Punishm. & Soc. 530, at p. 536). A variety of expressions, all of which allude to the fact that the offender will inevitably die behind bars, have been used to describe the nature of a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole (e.g., “living death sentence”, “death by incarceration”, “virtual death sentence”, “prolonged death penalty”, “delayed death penalty”, “death sentence without an execution date” and “the other death penalty”; see J. S. Henry, “Death‑in‑Prison Sentences: Overutilized and Underscrutinized”, in C. J. Ogletree, Jr. and A. Sarat, eds., Life without Parole: America’s New Death Penalty? (2012), 66, at p. 66). Once behind prison walls, the offender is doomed to remain there until death regardless of any efforts at rehabilitation, despite the devastating effects that this causes.

[83]                        The objective of rehabilitation is intimately linked to human dignity in that it reflects the conviction that all individuals carry within themselves the capacity to reform and re‑enter society. As J. Desrosiers and C. Bernard aptly write, criminal law is based, and must be based, [translation] “on a conception of the human being as an agent who is free and autonomous and, as a result, capable of change” (“L’emprisonnement à perpétuité sans possibilité de libération conditionnelle: une peine inconstitutionnelle?” (2021), 25 Can. Crim. L.R. 275, at p. 303).

[84]                        It is difficult if not impossible to predict an offender’s capacity for reform over a period of 50 years or more, let alone to predict whether the offender will actually be able to reform during their many years of incarceration. By depriving offenders in advance of any possibility of reintegration into society, the impugned provision shakes the very foundations of Canadian criminal law. It thereby negates the objective of rehabilitation from the time of sentencing, which has the effect of denying offenders any autonomy and imposing on them a degrading punishment that is incompatible with human dignity.

[85]                        To ensure respect for human dignity, Parliament must leave a door open for rehabilitation, even in cases where this objective is of minimal importance. Offenders who are by chance able to rehabilitate themselves must have access to a sentence review mechanism after having served a period of incarceration that is sufficiently long to denounce the gravity of their offence. This last point is important, as Parliament has latitude to establish sentences whose severity expresses society’s condemnation of the offence committed, and while such sentences may in some circumstances have the effect of dooming offenders to die behind bars, they are not necessarily contrary to s. 12 of the Charter.

[86]                        As an illustration, in Luxton, this Court rejected the argument that the mandatory sentence for first degree murder infringes s. 12 of the Charter. The Court considered it proper for Parliament to treat this crime — the most serious of all — with an appropriate degree of severity. The 25‑year parole ineligibility period reflects society’s condemnation of the commission of such a crime and does not outrage our standards of decency (Luxton, at pp. 724‑25). Because of the 25‑year mandatory ineligibility period, an elderly offender who is convicted of first degree murder will thus have little or no hope of getting out of prison. As was decided in Luxton, that sentence is nonetheless compatible with s. 12 of the Charter, since it is within the purview of Parliament to sanction the most heinous crime with a sentence that sufficiently denounces the gravity of the offence, but that does not exceed constitutional limits by depriving every offender of any possibility of parole from the outset.

[87]                        In the case at bar, on the other hand, the impugned provision authorizes the imposition of consecutive parole ineligibility periods of 25 years each, for each first degree murder, which has the result of depriving every offender who must serve such periods of the possibility of reforming and re‑entering society. J. S. Henry rightly states that “[death‑in‑prison] sentences are severe and degrading because, like capital sentences, they fail to recognize the intrinsic worth of the incarcerated person. The absence of all redemptive possibility denies human dignity” (p. 76). As Martin J. observed in Boudreault, in which the Court struck down the victim surcharge provision, “[t]he inability of offenders to repay their full debt to society and to apply for reintegration and forgiveness strikes at the very foundations of our criminal justice system” (para. 79). Although the context of that case was different from the present one, the principle it lays down that every offender should have the opportunity to reform and be reintegrated into society is of general application. The foundations of our criminal justice system, as discussed in Boudreault, require respect for the inherent worth of every individual, including the vilest of criminals.

[88]                        Contrary to what the appellants argue, the intent here is not to have the objective of rehabilitation prevail over all the others, but rather to preserve a certain place for it in a penal system based on respect for the inherent dignity of every individual. Where the offence of first degree murder is concerned, rehabilitation is already subordinate to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence, as can be seen from the severity of the punishment.

[89]                        The objectives of denunciation and deterrence are already attained by imposing the harshest mandatory minimum sentence provided for in the Criminal Code: imprisonment for life (s. 235 Cr. C.). The idea that parole puts an end to an offender’s sentence is a myth. Conditional release only alters the conditions under which a sentence is served; the sentence itself remains in effect for its entire term, that is, until the offender’s death (M. (C.A.), at para. 57). An offender who is granted parole “still carries the societal stigma of being a convicted offender who is serving a criminal sentence” (M. (C.A.), at para. 62). Moreover, an offender who is granted parole on the basis that they no longer pose a danger to society remains “under the strict control of the parole system, and the offender’s liberty remains significantly curtailed” (M (C.A.), at para. 62). The threat of reincarceration — should a condition be breached — hangs over the offender at all times (Conditional Release Act, s. 135). Contrary to popular belief, “[a] person on parole is not a free man” (R. v. Wilmott, 1966 CanLII 222 (ON CA), [1967] 1 C.C.C. 171 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 181).

[90]                        The 25‑year parole ineligibility period must also be placed in perspective in order to clearly illustrate its severity. It must be borne in mind that this 25‑year period, although constitutional, is far from lenient. In a report published in 1987, the Canadian Sentencing Commission noted that “[t]here has been extensive criticism of the 25 year term of custody without the possibility of parole. Many see it as inhumane: inmates have no opportunity to mitigate their sentences” (p. 262). Furthermore, inmates on whom this term is imposed have no incentive to conform to prison rules (p. 262).

[91]                        To put this in context, in a number of countries similar to Canada — countries governed by the rule of law where the sentence of imprisonment for life exists — there is a sentence review mechanism that is accessible to life prisoners following a minimum ineligibility period shorter than the one provided for in Canadian law for first degree murder. Some European countries have adopted a sentence review mechanism that is available to offenders upon completion of various ineligibility periods: Denmark and Finland (12 years), Germany (15 years), Switzerland (15 years, exceptionally 10 years) and France (normally 18 years, up to 22 years in the case of legal recidivism, but 30 years for certain types of murder).[2] There are other European countries where life imprisonment quite simply does not exist. For example, Portugal’s constitution includes an article that prohibits sentences of imprisonment for life (Constitution of the Portuguese Republic, art. 30(1); D. van Zyl Smit, “Outlawing Irreducible Life Sentences: Europe on the Brink?” (2010), 23 Fed. Sentencing Rep. 39, at p. 40), while Norway has provided that the longest prison sentence that can be imposed is 21 years, except with respect to the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, for which the maximum sentence is increased to 30 years.[3]

[92]                        This overview highlights the severity of Canada’s mandatory minimum sentence for first degree murder. There can be no doubt that the preponderant objectives of this sentence are denunciation and deterrence and that the place of rehabilitation is secondary. The only effect of s. 745.51 Cr. C. is to completely negate the last of these objectives, which is incompatible with human dignity for the reasons set out above.

[93]                        The appellants stress the importance of denouncing multiple murders more strongly by imposing a sentence that reflects the value of each human life that was lost. Such a sentence is based on a retributivist approach that could, on its own, justify a sentence of unlimited severity, and even a sentence establishing a true correspondence between the crime and the punishment. However, as Desrosiers and Bernard put it, [translation] “in a legal system based on respect for rights and freedoms, the ‘eye for an eye’ principle does not apply” (p. 292). The courts must establish a limit on the state’s power to sanction offenders, in keeping with the Charter.

[94]                        Furthermore, the objectives of denunciation and deterrence are not better served by the imposition of excessive sentences. Beyond a certain threshold, these objectives lose all of their functional value, especially when the sentence far exceeds human life expectancy. The imposition of excessive sentences that fulfil no function, like the 150‑year parole ineligibility period initially sought by the Crown in this case, does nothing more than bring the administration of justice into disrepute and undermine public confidence in the rationality and fairness of the criminal justice system. And this is leaving aside the fact that the imposition of extremely severe sentences tends to normalize such sentences and to have an inflationary effect on sentencing generally (Grant, Choi and Parkes, at p. 138, citing M. Hamilton, “Extreme Prison Sentences: Legal and Normative Consequences” (2016), 38 Cardozo L. Rev. 59, at pp. 106‑11).

[95]                        As the Court of Appeal aptly stated, the imposition of a parole ineligibility period that exceeds human life expectancy [translation] “is absurd. . . . A court must not make an order that can never be carried out” (para. 93). Although such a punishment could well be popular, it is contrary to the fundamental values of Canadian society. The thirst for vengeance that can drive us when a heinous crime is committed by one of our fellow citizens cannot justify imposing a sentence that, no matter how harsh it is, can never erase the horror of what the person has done.

(b)         Effects of a Sentence of Imprisonment for Life Without a Realistic Possibility of Parole

[96]                        As far as effects are concerned, offenders who have no realistic possibility of parole are deprived of any incentive to reform. As early as 1956, the Fauteux Report clearly stated that “[a]t no time should any prisoner have reason to feel that he is a forgotten man. . . . Prisoners should have some hope that imprisonment will end and thereby have some incentive for reformation and rehabilitation” (pp. 48‑49).

[97]                        The psychological consequences flowing from a sentence of imprisonment for life without a realistic possibility of parole are in some respects comparable to those experienced by inmates on death row, since only death will end their incarceration. In any event, “[w]hile there may not be universal agreement that [death‑in‑prison] sentences are worse than death, it is clear that [such] sentences are uniquely severe and degrading in their own right” (Henry, at p. 75 (emphasis in original)). For offenders who are sentenced to imprisonment for life without a realistic possibility of parole, the feeling of leading a monotonous, futile existence in isolation from their loved ones and from the outside world is very hard to tolerate. Some of them prefer to put an end to their lives rather than die slowly and endure suffering that seems endless to them (R. Johnson and S. McGunigall‑Smith, “Life Without Parole, America’s Other Death Penalty” (2008), 88 Prison J. 328, at pp. 332‑36; see also R. Kleinstuber and J. Coldsmith, “Is life without parole an effective way to reduce violent crime? An empirical assessment” (2020), 19 Criminol. & Pub. Pol’y 617, at p. 620). Effects like these support the conclusion that a sentence of imprisonment for life without a realistic possibility of parole is degrading in nature and thus intrinsically incompatible with human dignity. It is an inherently cruel and unusual punishment that infringes s. 12 of the Charter.

(c)           Dignity and Imprisonment for Life Without the Possibility of Parole: International and Comparative Law Perspectives

[98]                        Support for the conclusion that this sentence is unconstitutional can also be found in international and comparative law, under which a sentence of imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole is generally considered to be incompatible with human dignity. As Brown and Rowe JJ. noted recently in 9147‑0732 Québec inc., there is a role for international and comparative law in the interpretation of Charter rights (para. 28). However, “this role has properly been to support or confirm an interpretation arrived at through the [purposive] approach [established in R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., 1985 CanLII 69 (SCC), [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295]; the Court has never relied on such tools to define the scope of Charter rights” (9147‑0732 Québec inc., at para. 28 (emphasis in original)).

[99]                        Human dignity has been the central focus in the development of the international system for the protection of human rights since the end of the Second World War. The atrocities committed during that war led to international recognition of the fundamental importance of human dignity (Ward, at para. 57). It was specifically stated in the preamble to the Charter of the United Nations, Can. T.S. 1945 No. 7, that the peoples of the United Nations were determined to “reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person”. Two decades or so later, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Can. T.S. 1976 No. 47 (“ICCPR”), which Canada ratified in 1976, reiterated the importance of dignity as the foundation of fundamental rights and freedoms. The preamble to the ICCPR states that all the rights guaranteed therein “derive from the inherent dignity of the human person”. While the preamble is not binding as such in Canadian law, it does shed light on the way in which dignity is understood in relation to human rights, that is, as a value that underlies the recognized rights rather than as a right in itself.

[100]                     In the context of sentencing, in international law, the concept of dignity finds expression through the commitment to reintegrating offenders into society by offering them a possibility of being released. For example, art. 10 of the ICCPR states that “[a]ll persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person” (art. 10(1)) and that the “essential aim” of the penitentiary system is the “reformation” and “social rehabilitation” of prisoners (art. 10(3)). Because the ICCPR is an international treaty ratified by Canada, Canadian law is presumed to be in conformity with the commitments set out in it (Health Services and Support — Facilities Subsector Bargaining Assn. v. British Columbia, 2007 SCC 27, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 391, at para. 70; Saskatchewan Federation of Labour v. Saskatchewan, 2015 SCC 4, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 245, at para. 64). The ICCPR is therefore a relevant source for the interpretation of the Charter’s provisions (9147‑0732 Québec inc., at paras. 32‑34).

[101]                     Moreover, although criminal law is, generally speaking, a matter of domestic law, it is appropriate in this case to consider the approach to reviewing sentences taken by the International Criminal Court (“ICC”) and set out in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, Can. T.S. 2002 No. 13. Canada played an important role in the creation of that court and was the first country to incorporate the obligations flowing from that treaty into its national legislation. The ICC was established by the Rome Statute, which Canada ratified in July 2000. That international court conducts investigations and, where necessary, tries persons charged with “the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole”: the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression (Rome Statute, art. 5(1)). In June 2000, one month before the ratification of that treaty, Parliament enacted the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act, S.C. 2000, c. 24 (“Crimes Against Humanity Act”), which criminalized genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes under domestic law.

[102]                     The Crimes Against Humanity Act sets out the sentences that apply in Canadian law and the rules on parole eligibility for these three types of crimes. If an intentional killing forms the basis of the offence, the sentence is the same as for the offence of first or second degree murder, namely imprisonment for life (s. 4(2) of the Crimes Against Humanity Act). In the case of parole, however, Parliament enacted rules that differ from the ones in the Rome Statute. The Crimes Against Humanity Act states that the same ineligibility periods as in the Criminal Code apply, that is, 25 years for first degree murder and 10 to 25 years for second degree murder (s. 15(1) of the Crimes Against Humanity Act). In contrast, the Rome Statute establishes a mechanism for reviewing the sentences for these crimes: where the ICC has imposed a term of life imprisonment (art. 77), it must review that sentence after 25 years “to determine whether it should be reduced” (art. 110(3)). The ICC’s sentence review process has to do with sentence reduction, not with parole as is the case under Canadian law. In this context, the Rome Statute is relevant in the instant case only insofar as, like Canadian law, it recognizes the need to give offenders, including those who have committed the most serious crimes, an opportunity for rehabilitation.

[103]                     European law also provides useful guidance on the concept of dehumanizing and degrading punishments and on the importance of rehabilitation in criminal law. However, the weight to be given to the principles of European law is limited, because decisions of international and foreign courts are not binding sources in Canadian law (9147‑0732 Québec inc., at paras. 35 and 43).

[104]                     The decisions of the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (“ECHR”) recognize the principle of rehabilitation in sentencing (Vinter v. United Kingdom [GC], Nos. 66069/09 and 2 others, at § 114, July 9, 2013 (HUDOC); Murray v. Netherlands [GC], No. 10511/10, at § 102, April 26, 2016 (HUDOC); Hutchinson v. United Kingdom [GC], No. 57592/08, at §§ 42‑43, January 17, 2017 (HUDOC)). Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, 213 U.N.T.S. 221, provides that “[n]o one shall be subjected . . . to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”. In a number of cases, the Grand Chamber has had to consider whether a sentence of imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole is contrary to art. 3. In general terms, it has accepted that a sentence of imprisonment for life is not in itself contrary to that provision (Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], No. 21906/04, at § 97, February 12, 2008 (HUDOC); Murray, at § 99; Hutchinson, at § 42). However, it has found that, to be compatible with art. 3, such a sentence must be “de jure and de facto reducible”, which means that every prisoner must have a possibility of being released (Vinter, at § 108; Hutchinson, at § 42; see also Bodein v. France, No. 40014/10, at § 56, November 13, 2014 (HUDOC); Murray, at § 99). The review process “must take account of the progress that the prisoner has made towards rehabilitation, assessing whether such progress has been so significant that continued detention can no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds” (Hutchinson, at § 43; see also Vinter, at §§ 113‑16).

[105]                     Comparative law is relevant as well in showing the different perspectives that exist with respect to a sentence of imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole. While the domestic law of countries similar to Canada is instructive in this regard, it is not binding in Canadian law (9147‑0932 Québec inc., at para. 43). In this appeal, I will therefore refer to it only for the purposes of illustration.

[106]                     Germany, like France and Italy, has established that sentences of imprisonment for life without the possibility of release are unconstitutional (R. Hood and C. Hoyle, The Death Penalty: A Worldwide Perspective (5th ed. 2015), at p. 486). It was in 1977 that Germany’s Federal Constitutional Court considered the constitutionality of the sentence of life imprisonment for murder (Life Imprisonment Case (1977), 45 BVerfGE 187, translated into English in D. P. Kommers and R. A. Miller, The Constitutional Jurisprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany (3rd ed. 2012), at pp. 363‑68). The Constitutional Court held in that case that a sentence of life imprisonment is not in itself unconstitutional (p. 367). However, it found that imprisonment without any “concrete and realistically attainable” chance to regain freedom at some later point in time is contrary to human dignity (p. 366). The state must regard each individual within society as equal in worth and may not “turn the offender into an object of crime prevention to the detriment of his or her constitutionally protected right to social worth and respect” (p. 365). The Constitutional Court maintained that rehabilitation is constitutionally required in any community that establishes human dignity as its centrepiece (p. 366). That decision has had a certain impact on the development of European law with respect to life sentences (Vinter, at §§ 69 and 113).

[107]                     In contrast, other countries similar to Canada that also respect the rule of law take a more restrictive approach to parole access. In the United States, for example, imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole is considered constitutional (Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957 (1991)) except in the case of juvenile offenders (Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48 (2010)), including those convicted of murder (Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. 460 (2012)). However, the American approach differs from the one that exists under Canadian law, since that country applies the death penalty and has a narrower interpretation of the concept of cruel and unusual punishment (Kindler, at p. 812). Some other countries also have legislative schemes recognizing the possibility of imposing a sentence of imprisonment without the possibility of parole. In New Zealand, the minimum parole ineligibility period for an offender convicted of murder is 10 years, or 17 years in certain specific circumstances, but there is no maximum ineligibility period (Sentencing Act 2002 (N.Z.), ss. 103 and 104). In Australia, this type of sentence is also permitted in the various states and territories (J. L. Anderson, “The Label of Life Imprisonment in Australia: A Principled or Populist Approach to an Ultimate Sentence” (2012), 35 U.N.S.W.L.J. 747, at pp. 751‑53 and 759‑64). England and Wales, for their part, take a distinctive approach. A court has the power to order that any person given a life sentence for murder serve a parole ineligibility period with a starting point of 15 years, or 30 years in specific circumstances, or to completely exclude any possibility of release for the person (D. Ormerod and K. Laird, Smith, Hogan, and Ormerod’s Criminal Law (16th ed. 2021), at pp. 536‑37). However, it must be noted that courts in England and Wales, as well as the ECHR, take the view that there is an actual mechanism for reviewing life sentences in English law because of the existence of the Secretary of State’s release power under s. 30 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 (U.K.), 1997, c. 43 (R. v. McLoughlin, [2014] EWCA Crim 188, [2014] 1 W.L.R. 3964, at paras. 31‑35; Hutchinson, at §§ 70 and 72). I will come back to this point later.

[108]                     In summary, although s. 12, like any other Charter provision, must be interpreted primarily by reference to Canadian law and history (9147‑0732 Québec inc., at para. 20; see also Kindler, at p. 812), a parallel can be drawn between the approach taken in Canadian criminal law and the approaches taken in international law and in the law of various countries similar to Canada with respect to sentences of imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole, which are generally considered to be incompatible with human dignity.

(d)         Does the Judicial Discretion to Impose Consecutive Parole Ineligibility Periods Affect the Constitutionality of the Impugned Provision?

[109]                     In support of its position that s. 745.51 Cr. C. is constitutional, the Crown stresses the discretionary nature of the power granted to courts by this provision (see to the same effect R. v. Millard, 2018 ONSC 1299; R. v. Granados‑Arana, 2017 ONSC 6785, 356 C.C.C. (3d) 340; R. v. Husbands, [2015] O.J. No. 2673 (QL), 2015 CarswellOnt 7677 (WL) (S.C.J.), rev’d 2017 ONCA 607, 353 C.C.C. (3d) 317, but not on this point). According to this reasoning, the imposition of a disproportionate sentence results from an erroneous exercise of judicial discretion and can therefore be rectified by way of an appeal rather than a declaration of unconstitutionality.

[110]                     It is true that the imposition of consecutive parole ineligibility periods is not mandatory. Section 745.51 Cr. C. provides that a court may order that the parole ineligibility periods applicable for each murder conviction are to be served consecutively. In exercising its discretion, the court must take into consideration the character of the offender, the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission. In this regard, I note that the court’s obligation to stack ineligibility periods in blocks of 25 years, if it chooses to exercise its discretion, is difficult to reconcile with the principles of proportionality and individualization in sentencing.

[111]                     In any event, I am of the view, as explained above, that the existence of a discretion cannot save a provision that authorizes the imposition of a punishment that is cruel and unusual by nature. No crime, no matter how appalling it might be, can justify imposing a punishment that is intrinsically incompatible with human dignity, like a sentence of imprisonment for life without a realistic possibility of parole. Since such a punishment must quite simply be excluded from the arsenal of punishments available to the state, the mere possibility that it may be imposed constitutes an infringement of s. 12 of the Charter. By way of analogy, a provision authorizing corporal punishment as a sentence for the commission of multiple murders — a sentence that would be imposed at a court’s discretion and reserved for the vilest of criminals — could not, for obvious reasons, be held to be consistent with s. 12 of the Charter. The same conclusion must apply here.

(e)           Can the Royal Prerogative of Mercy Save the Impugned Provision?

[112]                     Lastly, it is necessary to determine whether the impugned provision can be found to be constitutional based on the existence of the royal prerogative of mercy, since there is some debate over this question. In my view, the parole system is currently the only mechanism that offers a realistic possibility of release for individuals serving a sentence of life imprisonment under Canadian law. The royal prerogative of mercy cannot be considered a true sentence review mechanism, because it is exercised only in exceptional circumstances.

[113]                     The royal prerogative of mercy gives Her Majesty the Queen an absolute discretion to grant a remission of sentence to any individual sentenced by a court, regardless of the nature or seriousness of the crime committed (ss. 748 and 749 Cr. C.). This prerogative arises from the former absolute power of British monarchs to pardon their subjects. Historically, the royal prerogative has had two strands and two objectives: “to show compassion by relieving an individual of the full weight of his or her sentence” and “to correct miscarriages of justice such as wrongful convictions” (Hinse v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 35, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 621, at para. 28). Before the death penalty was abolished, the royal prerogative was often used to commute that sentence (C. Strange, “Mercy for Murderers? A Historical Perspective on the Royal Prerogative of Mercy” (2001), 64 Sask. L. Rev. 559, at p. 561).

[114]                     The power to exercise this prerogative has been conferred on the person holding office as Governor General of Canada by Letters Patent (Letters Patent Constituting the Office of Governor General of Canada (1947), Canada Gazette, Part I, vol. 81, p. 3014, s. XII (reproduced in R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 31)). The Governor General acts only on the advice of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada, or that of at least one other minister (Parole Board of Canada, Royal Prerogative of Mercy Ministerial Guidelines, October 31, 2014 (online), at p. 2). The Governor General may grant two types of pardons: a free pardon and a conditional pardon (s. 748(2) Cr. C.).

[115]                     The royal prerogative of mercy is exercised “only [in] rare cases in which consideration[s] of justice, humanity and compassion override the normal administration of justice” (Ministerial Guidelines, at pp. 4‑5). For a pardon to be granted, there must be exceptional circumstances involving substantial injustice or undue hardship (pp. 3‑5). The Ministerial Guidelines state that pardons are available only in “truly deserving cases” (p. 3). Although it is difficult to calculate how many applications for the exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy have been granted, it would seem that the number is very limited (as an illustration, from 2014‑2015 to 2018‑2019, 5 applications were granted, 3 were denied and 175 were discontinued (Parole Board of Canada, Performance Monitoring Report 2018‑2019, at p. 170)).

[116]                     This Court has established that the royal prerogative of mercy is part of the array of mechanisms by which the principle of individualization in sentencing is given effect (Luxton, at p. 725). However, it has never found that this discretion on its own constitutes a true sentence review mechanism. On the contrary, in Luxton, to support its conclusion that the sentence of imprisonment for life without eligibility for parole for 25 years is constitutional, the Court simply stated that the royal prerogative, like escorted absences from custody for humanitarian purposes, demonstrates that “Parliament has been sensitive to the particular circumstances of each offender” (p. 725). In R. v. Heywood, 1994 CanLII 34 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 761, which concerned the constitutionality of a provision that limited, for life, the freedom of offenders convicted of sexual offences to be in various public places, on pain of imprisonment, this Court held that the royal prerogative of mercy does not constitute an “acceptable review process” because it is used only exceptionally (p. 798). The Court has instead found this discretion to be a mechanism of last resort in the case of unjust imprisonment (R. v. Sarson, 1996 CanLII 200 (SCC), [1996] 2 S.C.R. 223, at para. 51; R. v. Latimer, 2001 SCC 1, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 3, at para. 89).

[117]                     The royal prerogative of mercy in Canadian law can be distinguished from the power of the Secretary of State in English law to release prisoners on compassionate grounds under s. 30 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997. In 2014, a special constitution of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held in McLoughlin that the law of England provides life prisoners with a realistic possibility of release (para. 35). The court found that the term “compassionate grounds” must be interpreted broadly, in a manner compatible with art. 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and that these grounds are not restricted to the ones listed in the “Lifer Manual” (McLoughlin, at paras. 31‑33; United Kingdom, Ministry of Justice, National Offender Management Service, PSO 4700 — The Indeterminate Sentence Manual (2010), at ch. 12). In 2017, the ECHR held in Hutchinson that English law is consistent with art. 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights because it establishes a true review mechanism that makes whole life prison sentences reducible (§§ 57, 70 and 72). The ECHR found that the Secretary of State has a duty to release a whole life prisoner where “continued detention can no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds” (Hutchinson, at § 70). It would therefore seem that this discretion is broadly construed in English law. As a result, these principles are not relevant in interpreting the discretion conferred by the royal prerogative of mercy in Canadian law.

[118]                     In short, the royal prerogative of mercy, because of its exceptional nature, is at best a release mechanism based on compassion and on the existence of humanitarian grounds under Canadian law. Individuals suffering the normal consequences of a properly imposed sentence are in fact unlikely to obtain such a pardon. This is clear from the Ministerial Guidelines: “. . . an act of executive clemency will not be considered where the difficulties experienced by an individual applicant result from the normal consequences of the application of the law” (p. 4 (emphasis added); Sup. Ct. reasons, at paras. 963 and 967). The existence of the royal prerogative of mercy therefore creates no realistic possibility of parole for offenders serving a sentence of imprisonment for life for which there is no other review mechanism.

[119]                     Finally, in light of my conclusion concerning the infringement of s. 12 of the Charter, it will not be necessary to determine whether the impugned provision is also contrary to s. 7 (see Lloyd, at para. 38; Nur, at para. 110; Boudreault, at para. 95).

F.            Is the Infringement of Section 12 of the Charter Justified Under Section 1 of the Charter?

[120]                     In order to justify an infringement of a Charter right under s. 1, the state is required to show that the impugned law addresses a pressing and substantial objective and that the means chosen to achieve that objective are proportional to it (R. v. Oakes, 1986 CanLII 46 (SCC), [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, at pp. 136‑40; Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General), 1989 CanLII 87 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 927, at p. 986). A law is proportionate when the following conditions are met: “(1) the means adopted are rationally connected to that objective; (2) it is minimally impairing of the right in question; and (3) there is proportionality between the deleterious and salutary effects of the law” (Nur, at para. 111; Oakes, at pp. 139‑40).

[121]                     In this case, since the appellants have made no arguments concerning the justification for the impugned provision, they have not discharged the onus resting on them. In any event, it is hard to imagine how a punishment that is cruel and unusual by nature could be justified in a free and democratic society. I note that, in Nur, this Court stated that it would be difficult to show that a “grossly disproportionate” punishment under s. 12 could be “proportionate as between the deleterious and salutary effects of the law under s. 1” (para. 111).

G.           Appropriate Remedy

[122]                     Having found that the impugned provision is contrary to the Charter, I would declare s. 745.51 Cr. C. to be of no force or effect immediately under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. The appellants have proposed no alternative remedy in this Court.

[123]                     Under s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982, any law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution can be declared to be of no force or effect to the extent of the inconsistency. In Schachter v. Canada, 1992 CanLII 74 (SCC), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 679, the leading case on constitutional remedies, Lamer C.J. stated that, depending on the circumstances, a court may strike down an inconsistent provision immediately, strike it down and temporarily suspend the declaration of invalidity, resort to the technique of reading in or that of reading down, or apply the doctrine of severance (see pp. 695‑700). In exercising its discretion to determine an appropriate remedy, a court will consider not only the principle of constitutional supremacy in s. 52(1) but also the principles of the rule of law and the separation of powers (R. v. Albashir, 2021 SCC 48, at paras. 30 and 34; R. v. Sullivan, 2022 SCC 19, at para. 61).

[124]                     The trial judge found that the technique of reading in was appropriate in the circumstances. He therefore interpreted the provision as authorizing courts to impose consecutive ineligibility periods whose length is discretionary, [translation] “notwithstanding the requirements of section 745 for any additional murder” (para. 1211 (emphasis deleted)). Because that interpretation allowed him to opt for an additional period of less than 25 years, he ordered that the respondent serve a total ineligibility period of 40 years before applying for parole.

[125]                     In this regard, I agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial judge erred in applying the technique of reading in as a remedy (para. 154).

[126]                     The technique of reading in allows a court to extend the reach of a statute so that it includes what was wrongly excluded from it (Schachter, at p. 698; Ontario (Attorney General) v. G, 2020 SCC 38, at para. 113). For example, where a statute unconstitutionally excludes a group of individuals, a court may find that the statute includes the group rather than striking it down (Schachter, at pp. 699‑700; see also Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia, 1989 CanLII 2 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 143). Under the second technique, reading down, a court limits the reach of a statute by declaring it to be of no force or effect to a precisely defined extent (G, at para. 113). Severance, in turn, allows a court to declare something “improperly included in the statute which can be severed and struck down” to be of no force or effect (Schachter, at p. 698; G, at para. 113).

[127]                     A court may apply these techniques only “in the clearest of cases”, and to do so, it must be able to define the offending portion of the statute in a limited manner (Schachter, at p. 725; see also p. 697). In R. v. Sharpe, 2001 SCC 2, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45, McLachlin C.J. stated that these alternatives to striking down are appropriate when a court is confronted with a “law that is substantially constitutional and peripherally problematic” (para. 111). It follows that it is frequently not appropriate to use any of these techniques (G, at para. 114).

[128]                     These interpretive techniques must be applied in a manner that respects Parliament’s role and is in keeping with the purpose of the statute in question. In Schachter, Lamer C.J. stated that “there are some cases in which to sever the offending portion would actually be more intrusive to the legislative purpose than the alternate course of striking down provisions which are not themselves offensive” (p. 697). This note of caution also applies to reading in (Schachter, at p. 725). In every case, the court must ensure that the interpretation it proposes is as faithful as possible to the scheme enacted by Parliament, within the requirements of the Constitution (Schachter, at p. 700). As this Court stated in Ferguson, when a court opts for one of these techniques, “it does so on the assumption that had Parliament been aware of the provision’s constitutional defect, it would likely have passed it with the alterations now being made by the court” (para. 51). Therefore, “[i]f it is not clear that Parliament would have passed the scheme with the modifications being considered by the court — or if it is probable that Parliament would not have passed the scheme with these modifications — then for the court to make these modifications would represent an inappropriate intrusion into the legislative sphere” (Ferguson, at para. 51 (emphasis in original); G, at para. 114). In such a context, striking down the unconstitutional provision is the least intrusive alternative (Ferguson, at paras. 51 and 65).

[129]                     In this case, the trial judge found that because the inconsistency of s. 745.51 Cr. C. with the Constitution [translation] “does not in any way affect the core of this provision” (para. 1187), reading in was an appropriate way to remedy its unconstitutionality. In his view, reading into the impugned provision would advance Parliament’s objectives, namely [translation] “to promote proportionality, ensure that multiple murderers get their ‘just deserts’ for their crimes, reinforce the objective of denunciation and protect society” (para. 1172).

[130]                     I agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial judge overstepped the limits of his judicial functions. The impugned provision could not be saved through the technique of reading in. By broadening the discretion conferred on the courts, the trial judge undermined Parliament’s objective. He failed to consider the fact that the imposition of consecutive 25‑year ineligibility periods is directly related to Parliament’s objective in enacting s. 745.51 Cr. C. In this regard, the words of the provision and the parliamentary debate are indicators that can shed light on the provision’s purpose (see Mouvement laïque québécois v. Saguenay (City), 2015 SCC 16, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 81).

[131]                     First of all, the words of s. 745.51 Cr. C. are clear as regards the length of the ineligibility periods that a court may make consecutive: “At the time of the sentencing under section 745 . . . the judge who presided at the trial . . . may . . . by order, decide that the periods without eligibility for parole for each murder conviction are to be served consecutively”. For first degree murder, these periods must be 25 years under s. 745(a) Cr. C.

[132]                     Second, the parliamentary debate, which is very instructive in this case, clearly shows that Parliament’s intention was to authorize courts to make the ineligibility periods set out in s. 745 Cr. C. consecutive. For an offender convicted of more than one first degree murder, a court has no choice but to impose consecutive ineligibility periods in blocks of 25 years (House of Commons Debates, vol. 145, No. 96, 3rd Sess., 40th Parl., November 15, 2010, at p. 5931; House of Commons Debates, vol. 145, No. 121, 3rd Sess., 40th Parl., February 1, 2011, at p. 7510). The interpretation urged by the trial judge was in fact specifically rejected by Parliament. An amendment to the bill had been proposed to give courts a discretion to determine the total length of the additional parole ineligibility period (House of Commons Debates, February 1, 2011, at p. 7515; see also House of Commons, Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, Evidence, No. 42, 3rd Sess., 40th Parl., December 9, 2010, at pp. 10‑11). Despite that proposal, Parliament opted for ineligibility periods with a fixed length of 25 years each, leaving no room for tailoring by a court (Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, Proceedings of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, No. 22, 3rd Sess., 40th Parl., March 2, 2011, at pp. 10‑11 and 23‑24).

[133]                     Accordingly, because it is impossible to conclude that Parliament would likely have passed the impugned provision with the modifications proposed by the trial judge, reading in was inappropriate. Parliament deliberately chose to exclude the approach adopted by the trial judge. By opting for reading in as a remedy, the trial judge thus made an inappropriate intrusion on Parliament’s powers. In the circumstances, this Court has no choice but to declare s. 745.51 Cr. C. invalid.

[134]                     With regard to the temporal scope of the declaration of invalidity, the declaration must have immediate effect given the seriousness of the infringement of the right of every individual not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. To stop the continuing infringement of s. 12 of the Charter, this declaration with immediate effect must strike down the impugned provision retroactively to the date it was enacted in 2011.

[135]                     When unconstitutional legislation is declared to be of no force or effect immediately pursuant to s. 52(1), it can no longer be enforced. Such a declaration is generally retroactive and renders the legislation invalid from the date it was enacted (Albashir, at paras. 38‑39 and 43; Canada (Attorney General) v. Hislop, 2007 SCC 10, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 429, at paras. 82‑83; Nova Scotia (Workers’ Compensation Board) v. Martin, 2003 SCC 54, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 504, at para. 28). Retroactivity operates in favour of the parties by reaching back in time to annul the effects of legislation found to be unconstitutional (Hislop, at para. 82; see also Boudreault, at para. 103). It also benefits individuals who are still “within the judicial system” by allowing them to appeal on constitutional grounds (Boudreault, at para. 103; R. v. Thomas, 1990 CanLII 141 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 713, at p. 716).

[136]                     However, the doctrine of res judicata tempers the application of the principle that remedies granted under s. 52(1) are retroactive (Albashir, at para. 61). Res judicata precludes “the re‑opening of cases decided by the courts on the basis of invalid laws” (Reference re Manitoba Language Rights, 1985 CanLII 33 (SCC), [1985] 1 S.C.R. 721, at p. 757). In the context of criminal convictions, it is generally recognized that cases that are no longer in the system cannot be reopened, even if the provisions under which the accused persons were convicted are later declared unconstitutional (R. v. Wigman, 1985 CanLII 1 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 246, at p. 257; Thomas, at p. 716; Sarson, at paras. 25‑27). However, “a ‘continuing current violation’ of a Charter‑protected interest could give rise to a successful application for a Charter remedy, even where the violation began with a valid order that is legally unassailable” (Boudreault, at para. 107, quoting R. v. Gamble, 1988 CanLII 15 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 595, at p. 630).

[137]                     In Boudreault, this Court held that the rule of law, of which the principle of res judicata is one pillar, will not permit “the continued infliction of cruel and unusual punishment that cannot be justified in a free and democratic society” (paras. 105‑6). This is especially so where the punishment is cruel and unusual by nature, as it is in the instant case, which concerns the imposition of consecutive 25‑year ineligibility periods under s. 745.51 Cr. C. on offenders convicted of multiple first degree murders. Under this unconstitutional provision, offenders have been sentenced to imprisonment for life without eligibility for parole for 50 or even 75 years. Such a sentence is degrading in nature and thus incompatible with human dignity, as it eliminates any possibility of reintegration into society. Any offender who has been ordered under s. 745.51 Cr. C. to serve a parole ineligibility period of 50 years or more for multiple murders — whether the murders are first degree, second degree or a combination of the two — must be able to apply for a remedy. While some of these offenders are no longer in the judicial system, the infringement of their right guaranteed by s. 12 of the Charter is a continuing one, since they remain completely without access to parole. Res judicata cannot prevent them from bringing applications to stop this continuing infringement of s. 12 of the Charter. These individuals may therefore seek relief in the courts, including under s. 24(1) of the Charter (Boudreault, at para. 109; Gamble, at p. 649). Lastly, given that this Court has confined its analysis to the imposition of ineligibility periods of 50 years or more, nothing prevents offenders upon whom consecutive ineligibility periods totalling less than 50 years have been imposed under the provision being struck down from alleging a continuing infringement of their constitutional right, provided that the infringement is proved in each case.

[138]                     With regard to the respondent, given that s. 745.51 Cr. C. is being declared invalid immediately and that the declaration of invalidity is retroactive to the date this provision was enacted, the applicable law is the law that existed prior to that date. The 25‑year parole ineligibility periods imposed on the respondent for each of the 6 counts of first degree murder must therefore be served concurrently. As a result, the respondent may not apply for parole until he has served a total ineligibility period of 25 years, in accordance with s. 745(a) Cr. C. The Board remains the ultimate arbiter of whether the respondent can be released on parole at the end of the ineligibility period.

V.           Conclusion

[139]                     In summary, by stipulating that a court may impose consecutive 25‑year parole ineligibility periods, the impugned provision authorizes the infliction of a degrading punishment that is incompatible with human dignity. Under this provision, a court has the power to sentence an offender to imprisonment for life without a realistic possibility of parole for 50, 75 or even 150 years. In other words, in the context of multiple first degree murders, all offenders to whom this provision applies are doomed to spend the rest of their lives behind bars, and the sentences of some offenders may even exceed human life expectancy.

[140]                     Not only do such punishments bring the administration of justice into disrepute, but they are cruel and unusual by nature and thus contrary to s. 12 of the Charter. They are intrinsically incompatible with human dignity because of their degrading nature, as they deny offenders any moral autonomy by depriving them, in advance and definitively, of any possibility of reintegration into society. Sentences of imprisonment for life without a realistic possibility of parole may also have devastating effects on offenders, who are left with no incentive to rehabilitate themselves and whose incarceration will end only upon their death.

[141]                     Parliament may not prescribe a sentence that negates the objective of rehabilitation in advance, and irreversibly, for all offenders. This penological objective is intimately linked to human dignity in that it reflects the conviction that every individual has the capacity to reform and re‑enter society. For the objective of rehabilitation to be meaningful, every inmate must have a realistic possibility of applying for parole, at the very least earlier than the expiration of the minimum ineligibility period of 50 years stipulated in the impugned provision for cases involving first degree murders. What is at stake is our commitment, as a society, to respect human dignity and the inherent worth of every individual, however appalling the individual’s crimes may be.

[142]                     Let me be very clear. The conclusion that imposing consecutive 25‑year parole ineligibility periods is unconstitutional must not be seen as devaluing the life of each innocent victim. Everyone would agree that multiple murders are inherently despicable acts and are the most serious of crimes, with consequences that last forever. This appeal is not about the value of each human life, but rather about the limits on the state’s power to punish offenders, which, in a society founded on the rule of law, must be exercised in a manner consistent with the Constitution.

[143]                     In the circumstances, this Court has no choice but to declare s. 745.51 Cr. C. invalid immediately. This declaration strikes down the provision retroactively to its enactment in 2011. The applicable law is therefore the law that existed prior to that date. This means that the respondent must receive a sentence of imprisonment for life without eligibility for parole for a total period of 25 years.

[144]                     The respondent committed horrendous crimes that damaged the very fabric of our society. Fueled by hatred, he took the lives of six innocent victims and caused serious, even permanent, physical and psychological injuries to the survivors of the killings. He left not only families devastated but a whole community — the Muslim community in Québec and throughout Canada — in a state of anguish and pain, with many of its members still fearful for their safety today. And he left Canadians at large feeling deeply saddened and outraged in the wake of his heinous crimes that undermined the very foundations on which our society rests.

[145]                     Sadly, this case is but one example of the crimes committed by multiple murderers that shock our collective conscience. Other examples include murders committed by sexual predators who place no value on the lives of their victims and who leave entire communities in a state of fear and terror until they are apprehended. So, too, is the case of terrorists who seek to destroy Canada’s political order without regard to the devastation and loss of life that may result from their crimes.

[146]                     The horror of the crimes, however, does not negate the basic proposition that all human beings carry within them a capacity for rehabilitation and that, accordingly, punishments which fail to account for this human quality will offend the principles that underlie s. 12 of the Charter.

[147]                     All multiple murderers receive a minimum sentence of life in prison. In the current state of the law, they are eligible for parole after 25 years in the case of first degree murders. Eligibility for parole is not a right to parole. Experience has shown that the Board generally proceeds with care and caution before making a decision as important as releasing multiple murderers back into society. The protection of the public is the paramount consideration in the Board’s decision‑making process, but the Board also takes into account other factors such as the gravity of the offence and its impact on victims. It, perhaps, provides a measure of solace to know that compelling evidence of rehabilitation will be demanded before the perpetrators of such crimes will be released on parole.

[148]                     For all these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.

I.               Introduction

[1]                             This appeal concerns a custody dispute over a child who was apprehended at the age of four by the Director of Child Protection in Prince Edward Island (“Director”).[1] At the disposition hearing under s. 37 of the Child Protection Act, R.S.P.E.I. 1988, c. C-5.1, which occurred when the child was six, both his father in Alberta and his maternal grandmother in Prince Edward Island sought permanent custody. The hearing judge concluded that it was in the boy’s best interests to be placed with his grandmother, who had cared for him extensively throughout his life. A majority of the Court of Appeal reversed this decision and granted custody to the father, who had only learned he had a child when the boy was five years old and had only recently begun to have a relationship with him.

[2]                             At the conclusion of the appeal, we unanimously allowed the appeal. We set aside the decision of the Court of Appeal and restored the order of the hearing judge awarding the permanent custody and guardianship to the grandmother pursuant to s. 38(2)(e) of the Child Protection Act. Under the terms of the hearing judge’s final disposition, the grandmother was immediately entitled to the custody and guardianship of the child in P.E.I., and the Director was required to return him to the grandmother within two weeks of the decision. However, with the school year under way, to mitigate the foreseeable disruption and stress to the child, the Court permitted him to remain with the father in Alberta until March 21, 2022, which marked the commencement of the Alberta spring break. Thereafter, the child was to be returned to P.E.I. at the expense of the Director.

[3]                             This judgment was made without prejudice to any rights that either party may have to make an application to the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island relating to all questions of custody and access.

[4]                             Below, I provide the reasons for this Court’s judgment, explaining why the hearing judge made no legal errors that warranted appellate intervention and why that initial decision was entitled to deference.

II.            Factual Background

[5]                             This appeal has a long, complicated history.

[6]                             At the time the appeal was heard, W.D. was an eight-year-old child with high functioning autism. Those who know him report he is bright, energetic, loving, and very good with numbers. Since his diagnosis, he has received a variety of professional supports for his needs, including speech language pathology and occupational therapy services.

[7]                             W.D.’s mother and father (the respondent) met in June 2011, were married in May 2012, and lived together in Calgary, Alberta, with W.D.’s half-brother, who is the mother’s child with a previous partner. The appellant, W.D.’s grandmother, also resided in Calgary and before the mother and father moved into their own home, they and the half-brother lived with her.

[8]                             By all accounts, W.D.’s mother and father had a turbulent relationship. The father was arrested three times for violence and threats against the mother and entered into two peace bonds. The father testified that the relationship was “rocky”, blamed the mother for that, and denied he was ever violent towards her.

[9]                             The grandmother testified that in March 2013, W.D.’s mother arrived at her home with significant injuries and reported that W.D.’s father had beaten her. This incident not only contributed to the end of the mother and father’s relationship, it led to W.D.’s half-brother being removed from the mother’s care by child welfare authorities in Alberta and placed in the sole custody of his father in P.E.I. The mother left W.D.’s father and followed the half-brother to P.E.I. shortly afterwards. The mother and father finalized their divorce in 2014.

[10]                        W.D. was born in P.E.I. in October 2013. When W.D.’s mother left for P.E.I., W.D.’s father was unaware she was pregnant. He did not learn he had a son until the Director contacted him in the context of these proceedings in February 2019. W.D.’s half-brother continues to reside in P.E.I. and has maintained a close relationship with W.D. since his birth.

[11]                        W.D.’s mother tried to raise W.D. on her own but she struggled to care for her newborn as she battled significant mental health challenges. As the mother’s difficulties with parenting W.D. became clear, the grandmother quit her job, left her home in Alberta, and moved to P.E.I. to help. W.D. was around three months old when his grandmother first arrived in early 2014.

[12]                        Once she moved to P.E.I., the grandmother was deeply involved in his care. She lived with W.D. and the mother, supported them financially, and provided daily care to W.D. This arrangement lasted for approximately two years until March 2016, after which she returned to Alberta. The grandmother returned to P.E.I. in March 2017 and she resumed her role as W.D.’s caregiver. Though she did not live with W.D. at this time, she provided financial support and W.D. frequently visited her home.

[13]                        This arrangement ended abruptly in August 2017 when the mother’s condition worsened and she refused to allow the grandmother to contact W.D.

[14]                        A few months later, in January 2018, when W.D. was four years old, the Director apprehended W.D. from his mother without a court order. The Director believed W.D.’s mother was unable to provide adequate supervision or protection for W.D. on her own, given her continuing battle with mental illness. After many postponements, a combined protection and disposition hearing was eventually held (see Child Protection Act, ss. 36-37). On May 29, 2018, Justice Matheson found that W.D. was in need of protection from his mother and gave temporary custody of W.D. to the Director for three months.

[15]                        When the grandmother learned W.D. was apprehended, she took the necessary steps so that she could become his foster parent. In June 2018, two weeks after the initial protection order was granted, the Director entered into a foster parenting agreement with the grandmother and placed W.D. in her day-to-day care.

[16]                        While the foster parenting agreement was ongoing, the Director informed W.D.’s father in February 2019 that he had a son. After paternity was confirmed, the father wanted to have his son reside with him in Alberta, and began to prepare for parenthood. He took a parenting course and retained the services of a psychologist. The father is diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome and describes himself as someone with autism who is high functioning.

[17]                        In May and June 2019, the grandmother notified the Director about allegations of violence by the father, some of which impacted W.D.’s half-brother. The Director arranged an interview with the half-brother, but before this interview, and before W.D. had met his father, the Director amended its application to support the father’s bid for permanent custody. The interview with the half-brother took place a few days after the amendment of the application.

[18]                          The half-brother recounted that he observed violence between W.D.’s father and his mother, that he had once jumped on the father’s back in an attempt to protect his mother and that he had been thrown against a wall by the father, and that he feared the father. 

[19]                        On June 24, 2019, some three days after the half-brother’s interview, the Director continued to allow the father to have his first visit with W.D. as they planned in late May or early June.

[20]                        On June 24, 2019, the father flew to P.E.I. with his parents and the psychologist that he hired and they were all introduced to W.D. The Director allowed daily visits for the father over this two-week period. In that brief time, his visits went from fully supervised to completely unsupervised overnight stays.

[21]                        On June 20, 2019, the grandmother filed a motion for an order designating her a “parent” under s. 1(s) of the Child Protection Act. With this designation, the grandmother would have the statutory rights of a parent, including the right to file a parenting plan at the disposition hearing to outline a proposal for placing W.D. in her permanent custody (s. 37(1.2)). The Director opposed the motion.

[22]                        The motion judge concluded the grandmother met the statutory definition of a parent because she had stood in loco parentis to W.D. for a period of not less than one year and has a continuing relationship with him. The grandmother had stood in loco parentis during two periods: the two years after she arrived in P.E.I. soon after W.D.’s birth and until she temporarily returned to Alberta, and again when she acted as W.D.’s foster parent after his apprehension in January 2019. Further, the motion judge found the grandmother had an uninterrupted relationship with W.D. since he was an infant, despite the relationship facing numerous challenges. The court order recognizing the grandmother’s legal status as a “parent” of W.D. was effective as of July 2, 2019.

[23]                        The next day, on July 3, 2019, the Director ended the foster parent arrangement with the grandmother and removed W.D. from her care without notice. W.D. left his grandmother’s home for camp like normal, but he was apprehended by the Director who has never allowed him to return. The Director instead chose to place W.D. with foster parents, who were strangers to him. While this foster parent arrangement was in place, the Director allowed the grandmother to have supervised visits with W.D. for four hours per week.

[24]                        The Director said that W.D.’s removal from his grandmother’s care was because of the grandmother’s “negative messaging” to W.D. about his father. However, the hearing judge accepted the grandmother’s evidence she had never engaged in such conduct.

[25]                        On July 31, 2019, the Director appealed the order designating the grandmother a parent. That appeal was heard on December 9, 2019 and dismissed on December 12, 2019.

[26]                        Approximately four weeks into the new foster parenting arrangement, the Director elected to send W.D. to Alberta for a second visit with his father. The trip, which began on August 8, 2019, was to last three weeks, but W.D. has never returned to P.E.I.

[27]                        Thereafter, the Director hired the same psychologist retained by the father to assess the father’s parenting ability. On August 22, 2019, the psychologist recommended that W.D. remain in Alberta with his father. Shortly after, the Director decided to make the visit indefinite and enrolled W.D. in school in Alberta. Thus, when the disposition hearing on permanent custody eventually took place in February 2020, the Director had allowed W.D. to remain in Alberta with his father since the previous summer.

[28]                        After W.D. arrived in Alberta, the Director limited the grandmother’s access. Other than video calls, the Director had not permitted W.D. to see his grandmother for six months. However, just two weeks before the disposition hearing, the Director allowed the grandmother to travel to Alberta to have her first in-person visit over the course of a single weekend. The Director placed several conditions on the grandmother’s visit: her time with W.D. was supervised, limited to public spaces, and capped at seven hours over three days. The Director denied the grandmother’s request for an overnight stay with W.D. at her hotel and gave no reasons for requiring supervised visits.

[29]                        After months of delays, a review hearing of the initial apprehension order that was initially scheduled for October 3, 2018 finally took place on January 13-15, 2020 (2020 PESC 9). W.D. remained in need of protection from his mother and a disposition hearing was ordered to settle permanent custody.

III.         Judicial History

A.           Disposition Hearing under Section 37 of the Child Protection Act: Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island, 2020 PESC 23 (Key J.)

[30]                        The disposition hearing was scheduled over three days in February 2020, followed by a single day of oral submissions in March 2020. Given that W.D. had been in the temporary custody of the Director in excess of the statutorily permitted timelines, a further temporary custody order pursuant to s. 38(2)(c) of the Child Protection Act was not permitted. Rather, the court was required to place W.D. in the permanent custody and guardianship of either the Director (s. 38(2)(d)) or a “parent” (s. 38(2)(e)).

[31]                        Pursuant to s. 37, the father and the grandmother filed plans of care. W.D.’s mother refused to participate and the amicus curiae was unable to elicit a plan that she might wish to advance. The father filed a plan to have W.D. remain in Alberta and sought “full and sole custody” (para. 145 (CanLII)). The grandmother proposed a plan whereby she would “continue to do for W.D. what she has always done, namely, provide him with a loving home and all of the resources which he had prior to being taken away from her” (para. 191). She sought to have W.D. returned to P.E.I., where he could maintain his relationship with his half-brother and continue visits with his mother.

[32]                        While acknowledging that there were concerns around the grandmother’s “negative messaging”, the Director submitted that there were no protection concerns regarding either parent. The Director abandoned its previous endorsement of the father’s plan and took no formal position on permanent custody. Despite this asserted position, the hearing judge found that the Director made a series of decisions in an attempt to “tip the scales” in the father’s favour.

[33]                        Although the apprehension of W.D. by the Director meant that the proceedings were governed by the Child Protection Act, what was placed before the court was a “disguised” custody battle (para. 11). The hearing judge recognized that the sole issue was whether W.D.’s best interests favoured permanent custody with his father or his grandmother. The hearing judge awarded custody to the grandmother.

[34]                        The hearing judge premised her analysis on an extensive review of the evidence from nine witnesses, which included protection and access workers from P.E.I. and Alberta, the father, the mother of W.D.’s father, the psychologist, the grandmother, W.D.’s half-brother and the half-brother’s father. She summarized the evidence of each witness on a per witness basis and made express findings about their credibility and reliability and explained the weight she assigned to their evidence.

[35]                        In regards to the expert evidence of the psychologist, the hearing judge observed that while it is not always necessary for a parent to provide expert opinion evidence about their ability to parent, given the unique factors in this case, such evidence was relevant and necessary. She qualified the father’s psychologist as an expert in psychology with a specialty in children and the parenting of children and admitted her report.

[36]                        The hearing judge accepted the expert psychologist’s evaluation of the father’s parenting ability because it was “objective and unbiased” (para. 109). She noted that the expert psychologist travelled with the father for the two-week period in which he met W.D. She had spent much time with the father, was in contact with a number of the child protection workers in P.E.I. and Alberta, and continued to provide guidance and advice to the father.

[37]                        The hearing judge, however, assigned less weight to the expert psychologist’s view on the ultimate issue of whether permanent custody with the father was in W.D.’s best interests. She noted that the expert psychologist recommended to the Director that W.D. remain in Alberta, a recommendation with which the Director had “quickly agreed” (para. 108). The hearing judge concluded that when the psychologist stepped outside of commenting on the father’s ability to parent and opined about where W.D. should ultimately live, she had shown “a bias towards [the father] and she moved from being objective and nonpartisan to being an advocate for [the father]” (para. 109). She explained further that “her involvement with [the father] and his family may have clouded her view that any other parenting arrangement for W.D. would have been equally as beneficial” (para. 109), and that because she has never met W.D.’s mother or grandmother, “what little she knows of W.D.’s PEI family has been provided to her by the Director’s workers” (para. 110). The hearing judge concluded: “Therefore, while I accept the evidence of [the father’s] ability to parent, I have placed less weight on [the expert psychologist’s] opinion in terms of my ultimate decision” (para. 110).

[38]                        The hearing judge then tied the evidence she accepted from the numerous witnesses to each of the relevant statutory best interests of the child factors under s. 2(2) of the Child Protection Act. In doing so, she found: W.D. was safe with either parent (s. 2(2)(a)), there were no concerns with the ability of either parent to access care or treatment to meet W.D.’s physical, mental and emotional needs (s. 2(2)(c)), both parents had the capacity to ensure that W.D.’s developmental needs are met (s. 2(2)(d)), and either home would provide for W.D.’s security and the development of a positive relationship within the particular family with whom he resides (s. 2(2)(f)). Based on these considerations, the grandmother and the father — who were both parents for the purposes of her analysis — were “more or less equal in their ability to care for W.D.” (para. 215).

[39]                        However, her inquiry did not end there as there was “another factor” that, when duly considered, militated in favour of a grant of custody to the grandmother (para. 214). For the hearing judge, the primary differentiating factor was the grandmother’s willingness to support and promote W.D.’s relationship with the father and his family. The hearing judge accepted the grandmother’s evidence that she could “set aside any hard feelings toward [the father] and his family for W.D.’s sake”, that she would be respectful and allow W.D. to maintain contact with his father, and that she had “no issue flying with W.D. to Alberta and leaving W.D. with [his father] and his family for weeks at a time” (para. 192-93). The father, on the other hand, was resistant to committing to ensuring a meaningful relationship with the grandmother and W.D.’s then 17-year-old half-brother.

[40]                        The hearing judge noted that W.D. had the right to the love, affection, and ties of both families (s. 2(2)(g)). She found as a matter of fact that the grandmother would promote the relationship with the father and his family but, unless ordered by the court, the father would not ensure W.D. would have a meaningful relationship with his P.E.I. family.

[41]                        In arriving at her decision, the hearing judge was attuned to the Director’s handling of W.D.’s file, noting that at the time of the hearing, W.D. “continue[d] to remain in the custody and guardianship of the Director notwithstanding the review hearing took place approximately 20 months after he was apprehended, well beyond the statutorily mandated time limits” (para. 7). She concluded that the Director removed W.D. from his grandmother’s care and placed him in foster care “for flimsy reasons” (para. 8). She also observed that the Director supported the father’s parenting plan before having ever met him and even before father and son had even been introduced to each other.

[42]                        She concluded that the actions of the Director’s delegates effectively demonstrated that they only considered two options for W.D.: permanent custody with either the father, or the Director. Hence, despite the significant progress W.D. had made in the more than one year of his grandmother’s day-to-day care, W.D.’s family in P.E.I. was being disregarded in favour of the father. The “unstated goal” of the Director was to assist the father in becoming W.D.’s everyday parent (para. 89), without consideration of the possibility of the grandmother acting as W.D.’s permanent guardian. Moreover, the hearing judge found that the Director’s conduct “effectively tied the court’s hands preventing it from making a comprehensive custodial order with respect to W.D.’s future” (para. 90). That said, she expressly acknowledged that the focus of the hearing was not on blame, and reiterated that the “sole focus must be and is the best interests of W.D.” (para. 91).

B.            Court of Appeal for Prince Edward Island, 2020 PECA 14 (Jenkins C.J.P.E.I. and Murphy and Mitchell JJ.A.)

[43]                        The majority of the Court of Appeal agreed with two of the father’s grounds of appeal, and concluded that the hearing judge (1) considered an irrelevant factor, being the Director’s conduct; and (2) failed to consider the father’s principal argument that as a natural parent, the “parental preference” favoured his custody claim.

[44]                        On the first ground, the majority concluded that the hearing judge “allowed her distaste for the Director’s behaviour, an irrelevant consideration, to impact her assessment of the best interest of the child by giving less weight to [the expert psychologist’s] opinion” (para. 79 (CanLII)). There was no basis for the conclusion that the expert psychologist showed bias. The psychologist was clear her expert report was intended to opine on the father’s parenting ability; she did not opine on the grandmother, nor on whether an alternative parenting arrangement was beneficial. What the Director may or may not have done on the psychologist’s advice was irrelevant: the focus was to be solely on W.D.’s best interests.

[45]                        On the second ground, the majority found that the hearing judge failed to grapple with the father’s principal legal argument that a child’s welfare is best served in the custody of their natural parents and that natural parents should be deprived of custody only when clearly necessary. In doing so, she denied the father’s right to be heard. Moreover, it concluded that when a parent and non‑parent are “more or less equal” after all relevant factors are considered, or when the non-parent is only slightly better, the “natural parent factor” is decisive (para. 113).

[46]                        Rather than remit the matter, the majority concluded that W.D.’s best interests favoured permanent custody with his father. In arriving at its own determination, the majority accepted all of the hearing judge’s findings of fact, but afforded what it deemed as appropriate weight to the expert psychologist’s evidence and factored in the natural parent factor.

[47]                        Jenkins C.J.P.E.I., in dissent, would have dismissed the appeal. He found that reading the judgment as a whole, the hearing judge carefully assessed and balanced all of W.D.’s best interests. There was no basis for appellate intervention.

[48]                        On the first ground of appeal, he opined that the hearing judge was not put off track when she considered the Director’s actions. A judge can consider the surrounding context when assessing a child’s best interests. Here, that context included the Director and the father’s joint goal of securing the father’s custody of W.D. Nor did the hearing judge err in her finding that the expert psychologist went beyond her mandate and became an advocate for the father when she made a recommendation to the Director that W.D. remain in Alberta. The hearing judge was entitled to distinguish between the psychologist’s professional opinion on the father’s parenting ability and her recommendation that W.D. remain in Alberta until the disposition hearing.

[49]                        On the second ground, Jenkins C.J.P.E.I. concluded that the hearing judge’s failure to discuss the father’s argument on the “parental presumption principle” was not a material error (para. 184). The hearing judge dealt with the father’s natural bond without naming the natural parenting principle. She was aware that the father was W.D.’s biological father and aware of his developing bond with W.D. The father’s submissions on the natural parent factor ignored key considerations, including: W.D.’s strong bond with his grandmother, the grandmother’s status as a parent, and the hearing judge’s finding that the grandmother was more likely to maintain W.D.’s relationship with the father than vice-versa. The hearing judge concluded all things were not equal in this case: the grandmother would promote W.D.’s other familial bonds, whereas the father would not without a court order. This conclusion was “her call to make” (para. 203).

IV.         Issues

[50]                        Based on how the case was argued, three issues emerge for consideration:

1.      When can an appellate court intervene in determining the best interests of a child — i.e. what is the standard of review for disposition decisions pursuant to child protection legislation?

 

2.      Did the hearing judge err in her determination of the child’s best interests in the case at bar?

 

3.      How does the natural or biological parent factor weigh in determining the best interests of a child in a child protection matter?

V.           Analysis

[51]                        I answer each issue in turn and conclude that significant deference is owed to a judge’s determination of which custody arrangement is preferable in light of a child’s best interests. Appellate intervention is only warranted where a judge makes a material error, a serious misapprehension of the evidence, or an error in law. This standard was not met in this case. The hearing judge did not err in concluding that it was in W.D.’s best interests to be placed in his grandmother’s custody. Her analysis was free of legal error and consideration of the Director’s conduct did not inappropriately taint the analysis. Nor did the hearing judge err in failing to give weight to the father’s status as W.D.’s biological parent. These were her decisions to make. In awarding permanent custody to W.D.’s father, the majority of the Court of Appeal failed to afford the appropriate level of deference to the hearing judge’s assessment.

A.           The Standard of Review on a Determination of the Best Interests of the Child

[52]                        First and foremost, this appeal turns on the due operation of appellate deference in child custody matters. The parties argued about what the applicable standard of review should be when assessing a hearing judge’s conclusions concerning custody in a child welfare context. In my view, Van de Perre v. Edwards, 2001 SCC 60, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 1014, at para. 11, citing Hickey v. Hickey, 1999 CanLII 691 (SCC), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 518, at para. 12, governs: an appellate court is not entitled to intervene unless there has been “a material error, a serious misapprehension of the evidence, or an error in law”.

[53]                        The best interests of the child is the guiding principle in most custody matters, as it is under s. 2(2) of the Child Protection Act. To assess the best interests of a child, courts apply a multi-factorial legal standard, although different statutes may articulate the individual factors in slightly different ways. It is a highly contextual and fact driven exercise that involves a high level of judicial discretion: a case-by-case consideration of the unique circumstances of each child is the hallmark of the process. Those factors include “not only physical and economic well-being, but also emotional, psychological, intellectual and moral well-being” (Gordon v. Goertz, 1996 CanLII 191 (SCC), [1996] 2 S.C.R. 27, at para. 120, per L’Heureux‑Dubé J., dissenting, citing J. D. Payne, Payne on Divorce (3rd ed. 1993), at p. 279). 

[54]                        In a child welfare context in P.E.I., the criteria that govern the best interests determination are set out in s. 2(2) of the Child Protection Act:

(2)       The best interests of the child means the interests that appear, to the Director, or to a court, to be best for the child under the circumstances, having regard to all relevant considerations, including

 

(a)       the safety of the child;

(b)       the capacity of a parent to properly discharge parental obligations;

(c)       the physical, mental and emotional needs of the child, and the appropriate care or treatment to meet those needs;

(d)       the physical, mental and emotional level of development of the child;

(e)        the views of the child, where appropriate;

(f)       a secure place for the child and the development of a positive relationship as a member of a family;

(g)       the love, affection and ties between the child and persons who have had custody of the child;

(h)       the love, affection and ties between the child and other persons in the life of the child;

(i)       the cultural, racial, linguistic and religious heritage of the child;

(j)       if the child is aboriginal, the importance of preserving the cultural identity of the child;

(k)       the capacity of persons other than a parent to exercise custody rights and duties respecting a child;

(l)       the continuity of care for the child and the possible effect of disruption of that care on the child; and

(m)      the difference in the concept of time, and the developmental capacity of a child.

[55]                        In this legislation, as in others, no priority is given to one factor over the other. The question of which factors are relevant, and what weight should be apportioned to them, is a matter of judicial discretion with regard to the evidence before the court. The evidence that lays the foundation for the factors must first itself undergo a discretionary determination by the judge, regarding its admissibility, credibility, reliability, and weight. Indeed, an assessment of a child’s best interests can be conceptualized as requiring layered exercises of judicial discretion, in which the judge at first instance is “in the best position to assess evidence pertaining to the best interests of the child” (P. (D.) v. S. (C.), 1993 CanLII 35 (SCC), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 141, at p. 192, per Cory and Iacobucci JJ.).

[56]                        The leading decision on the appellate standard of review for custody and access decisions is this Court’s decision in Van de Perre. It provides that such decisions are inherently an exercise of discretion (para. 13). As a result, an appellate court must act with restraint and may only intervene where there has been “a material error, a serious misapprehension of the evidence, or an error in law” (Hickey, at para. 12; Van de Perre, at para. 11). An omission is only a material error “if it gives rise to the reasoned belief that the trial judge must have forgotten, ignored or misconceived the evidence in a way that affected his conclusion” (Van de Perre, at para. 15).

[57]                        This narrow scope of appellate review means that, absent a material error, the “Court of Appeal is not in a position to determine what it considers to be the correct conclusions from the evidence. This is the role of the trial judge” (Van de Perre, at para. 12 (emphasis deleted)). An appellate court is therefore not permitted to redo a lower court’s analysis to achieve a result that it believes is preferable in the best interests of the child.

[58]                          The Van de Perre standard reflects the significant deference that the decision of a judge at first instance as to a child’s best interests attracts, owing to the polymorphous, fact-based, and highly discretionary nature of such determinations (Hickey, at para. 10). In my view, absent something specific in the governing legislation, this same standard applies to custody decisions pursuant to child protection legislation.

[59]                          Nothing in s. 2(2) of the Child Protection Act supports or suggests a different standard of appellate review. Further, the same justifications expressed in Hickey that animated significant deference to child support awards apply with equal force to custody disputes under child welfare legislation. In both cases, what is needed is an approach that promotes finality in family law litigation, recognizes the importance of the highly discretionary nature of the decision and the appreciation of the facts by the judge at first instance who heard the parties directly, and avoids giving parties an incentive to appeal judgments in the hope that the appeal court will have a different appreciation of the relevant factors and evidence (Van de Perre, at para. 11; Hickey, at para. 12).

B.            The Assessment of the Best Interests of the Child Was Free of Error

[60]                        The hearing judge’s determination of W.D.’s best interests was grounded in a thorough assessment of the extensive evidence in these proceedings. Consistent with her duties, the hearing judge carefully addressed the testimony from each witness, commented on their credibility, and where necessary, indicated the portions of their testimony she accepted. She then related this evidence to the statutory factors relevant to W.D.’s best interests in a thorough analysis. In light of the evidentiary record, the hearing judge conducted an assessment that discloses no material error, serious misapprehension of the evidence, or legal error. Her findings were entitled to considerable deference.

C.            The Hearing Judge Did Not Err in Considering the Director’s Conduct

[61]                          To the extent that the majority of the Court of Appeal impugned the hearing judge’s decision for having been inappropriately influenced by the Director’s actions, it not only failed to apply the deferential standard of appellate review; it also failed to appreciate the potential significance of the Director’s conduct in a custody proceeding with a child welfare component. The problem with the majority’s reasoning is that it ignores that the proceedings before the hearing judge had in fact commenced as a result of the Director’s intervention. Most obviously, it disregards that the factual matrix before the hearing judge did not develop in a vacuum, but was shaped by the steps of the Director. I agree with Jenkins C.J.P.E.I. that impugning the hearing judge’s reasons in this respect is tantamount to a request that she “wear blinkers” (para. 213).

[62]                        That the hearing judge was alive to how the Director handled W.D.’s file did not distract from the focus of her decision: W.D.’s best interests. The hearing judge expressly acknowledged that “[a]ssigning blame for what has taken place . . . is not the role of this court. Despite the actions of the Director’s workers my sole focus must be and is the best interests of W.D.” (para. 91). That statement of law is not only correct, it was applied assiduously throughout the judgment. 

(1)         The Judicial Supervisory Obligation for Children in State Care

[63]                          No general principle prevents a judge on a best interests of the child analysis from considering the actions of a child protection agency. Such inquiries are not only permissible, they may in some circumstances be required on account of the court’s essential oversight role in child welfare matters and its parens patriae jurisdiction.

[64]                          The Director has the statutory responsibility to safeguard children and has broad investigative and apprehension powers to act in their best interests. Child protection workers perform an essential public service, under often arduous and challenging circumstances. The decision to place children in state care brings profound, life-altering consequences for children and families. “Few state actions can have a more profound effect on the lives of both parent and child” (New Brunswick (Minister of Health and Community Services) v. G. (J.), 1999 CanLII 653 (SCC), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 46, at para. 76). 

[65]                          Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms “requires that this dramatic form of state intervention only take place in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice” (Winnipeg Child and Family Services v. K.L.W., 2000 SCC 48, [2000] 2 S.C.R 519, at para. 15, per Arbour J., dissenting in the result). To ensure that child protection agencies exercise their jurisdiction only when warranted and with due fairness to children and parents, child protection statutes give courts the authority to supervise the exercise of an agency’s power (e.g., the Child Protection Act, ss. 27 and 29). This important role, with its attendant checks and balances, is exercised throughout the proceedings. Hence, even in the assessment of a child’s best interests, an agency’s decision-making process remains the proper subject of inquiry as part of the court’s oversight role. Similarly, the jurisdiction under parens patriae to act in the best interests of a child gives ambit to a superior court to take due notice of an agency’s conduct insofar as it impacts a child’s best interests.

[66]                        The hearing judge therefore committed no reviewable error by noting that the Director had over-held W.D. and breached the timeline prescribed under s. 41 of the Child Protection Act. As Matheson J. noted in a separate contempt hearing in this matter, “[w]hen a child is placed in the care and custody of the Director by a court, this care and custody is always under the supervision of the court” (2019 PESC 53, at para. 37 (CanLII)). As Matheson J. found, by July 16, 2019, the Director had exhausted the timelines under s. 41, and lacked the jurisdiction to hold W.D., direct his care, or transfer him to Alberta, without returning to court to seek a further period of apprehension.

[67]                          While judges must not lose sight of the child’s best interests, they should also not fear appellate intervention for exercising their supervisory functions by referring to or reviewing a child protection agency’s conduct. Provided the focus remains on the applicable legal principles, it is in everyone’s best interest that the checks and balances established in child welfare legislation are front of mind for all decision makers, including judges undertaking a best interests analysis.

(2)         The Director’s Conduct Situated the Status Quo and the Director’s Position

[68]                        In addition to the supervisory function of the courts, a child protection agency’s conduct can provide crucial context for understanding the status quo and the position taken by the agency in the proceedings.

(a)           Situating the Status Quo

[69]                          In custody proceedings involving a child protection agency, an agency’s conduct may have shaped, even defined, the factual matrix before the court, including the parties’ positions and conduct, and the status quo relevant to a child’s best interests. In the case at bar, after the initial apprehension, the Director directed every aspect of W.D.’s life: including where and with whom he lived, where he went to school, and who could see him when and the terms of their access. It was, therefore, not a legal error for the hearing judge to consider the Director’s conduct insofar as it allowed her to gain an understanding of what had happened, how a certain status quo was created, and the conduct and position of the parties.

[70]                          Here, the hearing judge thought it was necessary to consider the Director’s conduct to be in a position to properly assess the nature and extent of the father and the grandmother’s involvement in W.D.’s care in the months before the disposition hearing. By situating the relationship between W.D. and each of his potential caregivers as a function of the access and visitation rights offered to them by the Director, the hearing judge was able to assess the evidence and appreciate how some bonds may have come to be strengthened and others may have been weakened. It was clearly open to the hearing judge to take into account the different treatment provided to the father and the grandmother and to conclude that the Director promoted W.D.’s relationship with his father over the pre-existing connection with his grandmother by: arranging a two-week visit in P.E.I., granting daily visits that graduated from fully to completely unsupervised overnight visits in a matter of 12 visits; permitting W.D. to go to Alberta for a second visit; allowing W.D. to enroll in school in Alberta and to stay there pending the disposition hearing; and working with the father and the expert psychologist on the content of his parenting plan.

[71]                        The hearing judge was of the view that she could not fairly assess the grandmother’s parenting plan without also understanding the Director’s limitations on the grandmother’s access and how W.D. was removed from her daily care. It is not an error to consider whether such actions may have interfered with the continuity and closeness of their relationship. During the four weeks in which the Director placed W.D. with foster parents, the grandmother was permitted only 4 hours per week of supervised visits, despite having provided continuous day-to-day care for W.D. for more than 12 months. Her FaceTime calls were sporadic and monitored by supervisors. Similarly, when the grandmother was able to visit W.D. in Alberta, the Director permitted the grandmother to visit with W.D. for a mere three hours on Friday, three hours on Saturday and one hour on Sunday. The Director also required those visits to be supervised and limited to public places, and denied the grandmother’s request to have W.D. stay overnight with her in the hotel. The hearing judge also observed that the Child in Care Social Worker employed by the Director herself agreed that while the Director had the onus of making decisions in W.D.’s best interests to help support his family relationships, no initiatives were taken in this regard in respect of W.D.’s P.E.I. family.

[72]                          The hearing judge was allowed to consider how any unbalanced facilitation of access the Director gave to each parent would have had an impact on their bond with W.D. A judge assessing the best interests of the child has the authority to address how the Director’s decisions may have serious implications in the best interests analysis. In a different context, the fact that a parent only saw a child once, for a three-day period, in six months may support a finding of a limited desire to have a close connection with the child. When that fact is attributable to the Director’s decisions, the implications and available inferences change dramatically.

[73]                        In the same vein, the Director’s decisions structured the status quo as it existed at the time of the disposition hearing and the hearing judge was well within her authority to understand how that status quo came about. In many cases the status quo is an important consideration when assessing the best interests of children (see Beson v. Director of Child Welfare (Nfld.), 1982 CanLII 32 (SCC), [1982] 2 S.C.R. 716, at p. 728; K.L.W., at para. 18). However, courts have also recognized that in certain circumstances, it is inappropriate to give effect to an existing state of affairs. For example, return and retention orders restore the status quo that existed before a wrongful removal or retention (Office of the Children’s Lawyer v. Balev, 2018 SCC 16, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 398, at para. 24; Thomson v. Thomson, 1994 CanLII 26 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 551, at pp. 579-81). While the father pressed the status quo of W.D. living in Alberta before this Court, a status quo created from compounded actions or errors on the part of a child protection agency or others may require scrutiny. A court is entitled to look behind the veil of an existing status quo to understand how it came about and to assess whether that status quo is itself in the child’s best interests.

[74]                        In assessing the best interests of a five-year- old autistic child, the hearing judge was entitled to take into consideration that W.D. remained in his grandmother’s care for more than one year until the Director, without notice, abruptly took him away, placed him with another foster parent for four weeks, and then sent him to Alberta to stay with the father so that it could begin to assess the father’s parenting abilities given that he had never parented a child. The hearing judge was also within her authority to find that this dramatic removal was based on “flimsy” reasons and that the possibility of the grandmother continuing to care for W.D. was ignored. Her conclusion that it was “evident to the court that despite the significant progress W.D. had made in more than one year of [his grandmother]’s day to day care, W.D.’s family in P.E.I. was being discarded in favour of [the father]”, was one she was authorized to make (paras. 80 and 85).

(b)         Situating the Director’s Position and Actions

[75]                          Similarly, the hearing judge could consider how a child protection agency’s conduct may help situate or explain the position taken by an agency either inside or outside of court. Faced with representations from a child protection agency regarding the fitness of parents, a court should not be prohibited from considering the manner in which the agency investigated and treated the parties involved to assess the weight that can be placed on such evidence or arguments. This ability to weigh such evidence takes on particular significance where, as here, an agency has, at any point in the proceedings, supported one potential caregiver over another. Here, the hearing judge committed no error in taking into account the Director’s prior conduct, including its prior statements and the investigation and level of scrutiny employed vis-à-vis each parent, to assess the Director’s position at the disposition hearing.

[76]                          It was open to the hearing judge to find that the Director’s professed neutrality at the hearing was “simply not credible”, that the “scales were tipped” by the Director in favour of the father; and that the Director’s actions had “effectively tied the court’s hands” (paras. 89-90). She specifically rejected the child protection worker’s testimony that the Director was not promoting the plan of care of either parent based on her answers in cross-examination. The hearing judge concluded that the timeline of events showing the different actions and decisions taken by the Director “demonstrate[d] a plan which contradicts the Director’s stated submission of not supporting” either the father or the grandmother in their plans of care (para. 87). She was also within her remit to question why the Director chose at one point to support the father’s custody and ask why, if the Director truly had no concerns with either parent, she did not remove herself from the process to allow the parents to advance their competing custody claims via the appropriate legislation, instead of under the Child Protection Act.

(3)         The Director’s Conduct Grounded the Assessment of the Evidence

[77]                          In addition to fulfilling the court’s oversight role and informing background considerations, the hearing judge could also turn to the Director’s evidence and conduct to allow her to properly assess (1) the claims made by the father and the grandmother as to their appetite and ability to facilitate access with the other parent, and (2) the impartiality of the expert witness and the weight to be given to her evidence.

(a)           The Parents’ Willingness to Facilitate Access

[78]                          The Director’s evidence was used to help the hearing judge evaluate the claims of each parent regarding their willingness to facilitate contact with the other. The hearing judge found that the Director removed W.D. from the grandmother’s care for “flimsy” reasons, and that the grandmother did not engage in negative messaging about the father. These findings underpinned her conclusion that the grandmother was more likely to foster W.D.’s relationship with his father than vice-versa; a point on which the final determination came to rest.

[79]                          Specifically, had the Director actually ended the foster parent arrangement with the grandmother out of genuine concerns around “negative messaging”, the grandmother’s claims that she would foster W.D.’s relationship with the father would have been less credible and compelling. Relatedly, the father’s reluctance to allow W.D. to visit with the grandmother due to her “negative messaging” would have been more reasonable. The hearing judge’s assessment of the Director’s evidence necessarily lent greater credibility and weight to the grandmother’s denials and reduced the reasonableness of the father’s reluctance to allow W.D. to visit with the grandmother due to her “negative messaging”. She committed no error in this regard.

(b)         The Expert Evidence

[80]                          I also cannot agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that the hearing judge’s views regarding the conduct of the Director inappropriately impacted her decision to accord limited weight to the expert psychologist’s view that W.D. should live with his father.

[81]                        The hearing judge took a measured approach: she qualified this expert, admitted her report and accepted her evidence about the father’s parenting abilities, saying it gave the court some comfort. However, she gave limited weight to the expert’s opinion about what placement was in the W.D.’s best interests, the ultimate issue the hearing judge was to decide. The hearing judge observed that the expert’s evidence had its limits in assisting on the ultimate decision of what was in W.D.’s best interests because the expert’s involvement with the father may have “clouded her view” that W.D. would equally benefit from an alternative arrangement (para. 109).

[82]                        The majority of the Court of Appeal overturned the hearing judge on this point, substituted its view of how the expert’s evidence should have been weighed, and granted custody to the father in part on this basis. With respect, the hearing judge committed no reviewable error and she was entitled to determine the weight to be given to the expert’s opinion on this point.

[83]                        The hearing judge was obliged to consider the objectivity and impartiality of the expert opinion evidence to ascertain both its threshold admissibility and the weight that should ultimately be ascribed to it (White Burgess Langille Inman v. Abbott and Haliburton Co., 2015 SCC 23, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 182, at para. 32; Mouvement laïque québécois v. Saguenay (City), 2015 SCC 16, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 106). That the expert psychologist was engaged first by the father as a private professional to provide assistance about how to parent and then retained by the Director as a purportedly neutral observer to assist in evaluating the father’s abilities to parent, creates the very type of prima facie conflict of interest or fear of allied interests that would entitle the hearing judge to assess the impact, if any, this dual relationship had on the admissibility and weight of the expert evidence presented (see N. Bala and J. Thomson, Expert Evidence and Assessments in Child Welfare Cases (2015), at pp. 25-26).

[84]                        As the “gatekeeper” of evidence, it was well within the hearing judge’s purview to determine the weight to be given to this part of the expert’s opinion (The Queen v. Lupien, 1969 CanLII 55 (SCC), [1970] S.C.R. 263, at p. 280, see also White Burgess, at para. 20). The hearing judge was not required to adopt an “all-or-nothing” approach to the evidence (see R. v. Le, 2019 SCC 34, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 692, at para. 266). She observed that the expert was not impartial on this issue and that she was not in a position to offer an informed opinion about the relative merits of each parent’s claims because although she had first-hand knowledge of the father’s abilities, her appreciation for the grandmother’s ability was only second-hand and sourced from the Director. Hence, she was not in a position to undertake a fair and reliable comparative analysis of W.D.’s best interests as between these two parents, and in turn, advance an opinion on his placement. The hearing judge was within her authority to conclude that while the expert’s evidence was probative insofar as it spoke to the father’s parenting abilities, her evidence merited less weight when she opined on W.D.’s ultimate placement. There is no material error that would allow appellate intervention on this finding and her determination deserved deference.

D.           The Hearing Judge Did Not Err in Her Approach to the Father’s Biological Ties

[85]                        The grandmother submits that the majority of the Court of Appeal erred in effectively resurrecting a presumption in favour of biology when it awarded custody to the father. She cites the majority’s conclusion that a biological parent is preferred when two prospective custodial parents are otherwise equal.

[86]                        For the father, the role of biological ties has shifted over time. At the early stages, when the father’s relationship with W.D. was new, his claim as W.D.’s biological father was asserted more forcefully, arguing at the disposition hearing that, as the natural parent, he had a preferred status in W.D.’s custody. As his bond with W.D. has grown over time, however, the father increasingly relied on his emerging parenting skills, his deeper connection to W.D. and the status quo. Nevertheless, before the Court of Appeal, he asked that the “parental presumption principle”, or the principle that the “welfare of the child is best served in the custody of [the child’s] natural parent” be recognized (paras. 183-84 (emphasis omitted)). Before this Court, with the expert psychologist’s evidence and the Director’s statement that there are no concerns with his parenting, he says this case is “not about biology” and agrees there is no presumption favouring biological parents.

[87]                        I agree with the grandmother that the majority of the Court of Appeal overstated the importance of the father’s biological tie to W.D. While the majority found there was no presumption in favour of biology, it concluded biological parenthood was “very important” and held courts should consider it a decisive tie-breaker when a parent and non-parent were otherwise equal (at para. 112). As I will explain, in this custody dispute, a parent’s mere biological tie is simply one factor among many that may be relevant in some cases to a child’s best interests, which is and must be the paramount consideration. Judges are not obliged to treat biology as a tie-breaker when two prospective custodial parents are otherwise equal.

(1)         The Historical Approach to Biology in the Assessment of a Child’s Best Interests

[88]                        Courts have gradually moved away from an emphasis on parental rights and biological ties in settling custody matters, whether arising from a private dispute, an adoption, or the state’s apprehension of children in need of protection.

[89]                        The transition away from parental rights and biological ties occurred over several centuries and involved shifts brought about by legislative intervention as well as judicial innovation. The step that is most important for this case is King v. Low, 1985 CanLII 59 (SCC), [1985] 1 S.C.R. 87, a decision of this Court, that ended the presumptive right of custody in favour of natural parents over adoptive parents that this Court established in the 1950s (see Re Baby Duffell: Martin v. Duffell, 1950 CanLII 11 (SCC), [1950] S.C.R. 737, at p. 744; Hepton v. Maat, 1957 CanLII 18 (SCC), [1957] S.C.R. 606, at pp. 607-8 and 615; and Re Agar; McNeilly v. Agar, 1957 CanLII 22 (SCC), [1958] S.C.R. 52, at p. 53). In King v. Low, a mother gave her newborn son to a couple for adoption. Before the adoption process was over, the mother requested the child’s return, which the couple refused, and a custody dispute ensued. At trial, custody was awarded to the adoptive parents. The judge concluded the benefits of stability and the child’s bond with his adoptive parents outweighed the benefit of his biological mother’s care.

[90]                          Writing for the Court, McIntyre J. upheld the decisions of the courts below. In doing so, he recognized several principles that are relevant in this appeal. The “paramount consideration”, he noted, in custody disputes involving a “natural” parent and another parental figure is the welfare of the child (p. 93). The preference for natural parents developed in the adoption context, where only one party was a natural parent. Further, McIntyre J. endorsed the trial judge’s conclusion that a natural parent is preferred not because of biology per se, but due to the emotional or psychological bond that is presumed to develop when a parent begins to care for a newborn. The question of which prospective custodial parents developed this bond is a consideration that should prevail over an “empty formula”, like a biological tie (p. 104). The legal significance of biological ties in the best interests assessment, moreover, has diminished with “changing social conditions and attitudes” (p. 97).  

(2)         Biological Ties Will Generally Carry Limited Weight in the Assessment of a Child’s Best Interests

[91]                        As noted, King v. Low rejected that biological parents have a prima facie entitlement to their child’s custody, concluding a child’s best interests is the paramount consideration in custody disputes. Legislation now often dictates that it is also the sole consideration (Young v. Young, 1993 CanLII 34 (SCC), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 3, at p. 37, per L’Heureux‑Dubé J., dissenting in the result; see also Frame v. Smith, 1987 CanLII 74 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 99, at p. 132).

[92]                        It is also now common for legislatures to enumerate a non-exhaustive list of factors applicable to a child’s best interests in a given context (A. Wilton, G. S. Joseph and T. Train, Parenting Law and Practice in Canada (loose-leaf), vol. 1, at § 6:1). For example, the Divorce Act sets out best interests factors which govern custody disputes between persons who are divorcing (Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.), s. 16(3)). Similarly, provincial and territorial statutes establish best interests considerations that govern between non-married persons (e.g., Family Law Act, S.A. 2003, c. F-4.5, s. 18; Children’s Law Act, R.S.P.E.I. 1988, c. C-6.1, s. 33). Other statutes, which more directly involve the state, like child welfare legislation and adoption laws, also establish criteria to determine what is in the child’s best interests (Child Protection Act, s. 2(2); Child, Youth and Family Enhancement Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. C-12, s. 2(1)). 

[93]                        Statutory factors provide the starting point for assessing the relevance of biological ties. When assessing a child’s best interests, a court should consider any applicable factors enumerated in the pertinent legislation (Van de Perre, at para. 9). Statutory factors offer clarity, structure, predictability and represent a legislature’s views on which factors are important based on “decades of careful study into children’s needs and how the law can best meet them” (A.C. v. Manitoba (Director of Child and Family Services), 2009 SCC 30, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 181, at para. 92; see also N. Bala, “Bringing Canada’s Divorce Act into the New Millennium: Enacting a Child-Focused Parenting Law” (2015), 40 Queen’s L.J. 425). Given the progressive shift away from biological ties in Canada’s legal history, a legislature’s decision to omit biology among the relevant statutory factors to the best interests of the child assessment also reflects a decision to downplay its significance.

[94]                        In this case, the starting point is the list of factors enumerated in s. 2(2) of the Child Protection Act. Here, some express factors may implicate biology, like taking into account the child’s aboriginal, and/or cultural, racial, linguistic and religious heritage (s. 2(2)(i)(j)). However, none of the enumerated factors specifically relate to a parent’s biological ties. Paragraphs (g) and (h) refer to the “love, affection and ties” between the child and persons who have had custody of the child or other persons in the child’s life. As “ties” is coupled with the words “love” and “affection”, the principle of statutory interpretation that the meaning of a term is known by its associates implies the “ties” at issue are the child’s emotional or psychological ties (R. Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (6th ed. 2014), at § 8.58; 2747-3174 Québec Inc. v. Quebec (Régie des permis d’alcool), 1996 CanLII 153 (SCC), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 919, at para. 195). While other statutes may be different, the statutory factors applicable in this case, therefore, do not direct a court to consider a child’s biological relationship with the party seeking custody. In light of this omission, the Child Protection Act accords little weight to biology as it impacts the best interests of the child assessment.

[95]                        It is true the Child Protection Act affords various rights to “a parent”, including the right to counsel under s. 30. However, it must first be acknowledged that these procedural rights are not afforded to biological parents alone. The definition of “parent” reflected in s. 1(s) of the Child Protection Act is broad and inclusive. It includes a birth or adoptive parent (s. 1(s)(i)). But it also includes a person who has stood in loco parentis for over a year (as here) (s. 1(s)(ii)), a legal guardian (s. 1(s)(iii)), or a person responsible for the child’s care and with whom the child resides (s. 1(s)(iv)). The Child Protection Act’s preamble references the need to ensure children are removed from their parents’ care only when other measures have failed. Yet, given a “parent” includes biological and non-biological parents, the preamble applies to both alike. The legislation is not protecting or privileging blood ties: it is setting out procedural safeguards for all of those individuals, with or without a biological tie to the child, who have a connection with the child as a statutorily defined “parent”. 

[96]                        Further, these rights are a response to the state’s authority to remove children from their existing families and reflect the significant impact such proceedings have on children and parents alike. Parents are afforded several procedural protections to ensure the proceedings are fair, including a right to counsel (G. (J.), at paras. 70-75, citing La Forest J. in B. (R.) v. Children’s Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto, 1995 CanLII 115 (SCC), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 315, at para. 88). The procedural rights afforded to parents under the statute, however, do not add greater weight to biological ties in the assessment of a child’s best interests under the Child Protection Act or otherwise.

[97]                        In the end, the child’s best interests is the paramount consideration in child protection proceedings (G. (J.), at para. 72). State apprehension is warranted when maintaining a child’s existing family relationship is no longer in the child’s best interests (Catholic Children’s Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto v. M. (C.), 1994 CanLII 83 (SCC), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 165, at p. 203). This aligns with the balance that child protection legislation attempts to strike between a child’s best interests and preserving their existing family unit (M. (C.), at p. 196; see also M. J. Schlosser, “Third Party Child-Centred Disputes: Parental Rights v. Best Interests of the Child” (1984), 22 Alb. L. Rev. 394, at p. 409).

[98]                        In any event, the concern in the preamble for ensuring children are removed from their parents only when others measure have failed is not in play when the state is not seeking custody, as is the case here.

[99]                        To sum up, the applicable statutory factors in this case do not direct a court to weigh biology in the assessment of a child’s best interests. Indeed, the omission signals that relatively less weight ought to be afforded this factor. But the statutory factors are non-exhaustive. The question remains, then, whether it is within a court’s discretion to assign weight to biological ties as a non-enumerated factor.

[100]                     I agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that a court may consider biological ties in assessing a child’s best interests if they have some link to the child’s best interests. The majority, however, overstated the importance of a biological tie in itself when it concluded it was an “important, unique and special” factor that must be a tie-breaker when two prospective custodial parents are otherwise equal (paras. 111-13). Further, I disagree with the majority that biology has any relevance in a case like the one at bar, where both legal parents have biological ties and nothing in the record establishes that one type of tie is better than the other.

[101]                     It is not an error, in my view, for a court to consider a biological tie in itself in evaluating a child’s best interests under this act, even though courts should be reluctant to superimpose the factor onto a statute when a legislature has omitted it, since courts and legislatures have progressively moved away from biological ties. Nevertheless, courts have considerable discretion in identifying and weighing the factors that are relevant in a given case (Van de Perre, at paras. 11‑13, citing Hickey, at paras. 10 and 12). As a result, a court may conclude the evidence supports assigning weight to a biological tie if it can make the link to a child’s best interests. That said, a biological tie in itself should generally carry minimal weight for several reasons.

[102]                     First, too great an emphasis on biological ties may lead some decision makers to give effect to the parent’s claims over the child’s best interests. Parental preferences should not usurp the focus on the child’s interests. As Wilson J. wrote in Racine v. Woods, 1983 CanLII 27 (SCC), [1983] 2 S.C.R. 173, at p. 185: “. . . a child is not a chattel in which its parents have a proprietary interest; it is a human being to whom they owe serious obligations.”

[103]                     Second, King v. Low concluded that a child’s bond is a consideration that should prevail over the “empty formula” of a biological tie (para. 104). King v. Low’s statement that a biological parent’s claims should not be “lightly” set aside must be read in the adoption context in which it arose and alongside the Court’s ultimate emphasis on the child’s bond (para. 101). King v. Low implies that biological parents’ claims must not be “lightly” set aside only because a biological tie is a presumed proxy for the parent with whom a child has the closest emotional or psychological bond. A child will frequently have a strong attachment to a biological parent as they are generally among the persons most involved in the child’s care. Yet this does not confer significant weight to a biological tie in itself. It is the biological parent’s caregiving role that fosters a child’s psychological and emotional attachment, not the biological tie itself.

[104]                     There is “no magic to the parental tie” (Young, at p. 38, per L’Heureux‑Dubé J., dissenting in the result). The very need for child protection legislation underscores that a biological connection is no guarantee against harm to a child. On the other hand, a child can be equally attached to persons who are not their biological parents and those persons can be equally capable of meeting the child’s needs, as this case and King v. Low illustrate. Thus, King v. Low does not give significant weight to a biological tie in itself, but treats it as a presumed proxy for a child’s strongest bond.

[105]                     Since biological ties are a presumed proxy for a bond, any advantages that favour the biological parent will usually be captured and subsumed within the broader inquiry into a child’s best interests. In particular, if the biological parent is closer to the child, and better able to meet the child’s needs, this will be reflected in a wider range of relevant factors, like the child’s relationship to the parent, the views and preferences of the child, and the ability to meet the child’s needs, including the child’s safety, security, and well-being (Wilton, Joseph and Train, at § 6:1). To the extent a parent relies on biology for considerations related to the child’s culture, race or heritage, it may be addressed within those factors.

[106]                     Third, the benefit of a biological tie itself may be intangible and difficult to articulate (British Columbia Birth Registration No. 99-00733, Re, 2000 BCCA 109, 73 B.C.L.R. (3d) 22, at para. 117). This makes it difficult to prioritize it over other best interests factors that are more concrete. For example, in this case, the decisive factor was which parent was more likely to foster W.D.’s relationship with the other parent. This factor clearly benefits the child: it ensures the child is placed with the parent who will best promote the child’s emotional and psychological relationship with the other parent. In comparison, the benefit of the father’s biological tie itself is harder to identify. Further, any benefit from a connection to a biological parent, such as a “sense of security” in knowing one’s “roots”, as the majority of the Court of Appeal put it, may be achieved through access and parenting time rather than custody (para. 111).

[107]                     As well, the importance of biological ties may diminish as children are increasingly raised in families where those ties do not define a child’s family relationships. Family institutions have “undergone a profound evolution” and changing social conditions, as noted, have diminished the significance of biological ties (Young, at p. 43; King v. Low, at p. 97). Change and evolution continues today. Contemporary shifts in parenting and family composition may undermine the relevance of biological ties.

[108]                     Finally, as in this case, courts should be cautious in preferring one biological tie over another absent evidence that one is more beneficial than another. This Court has moved away from stereotyped and formulaic solutions like the “tender years” doctrine (Young, at p. 43; A.C., at para. 92). Unsupported generalizations about, as in this case, the caregiving capacity of a biological father versus a grandmother, or vice versa, are similarly inappropriate. Comparing the closeness or degree of biological connection is a tricky, reductionist and unreliable predictor of who may best care for a child. It fails to take into account how often other family members assume care for children whose biological parents cannot act as caregivers as a result of addictions, mental health issues, criminal behavior, or other challenges. It also overlooks that a custody dispute that is superficially between two biological parents may frequently draw in several family members, as a parent’s extended family may also assist in care and feel invested in seeing a custody claim succeed. Here, not only did the grandmother step up to assist her daughter to care for W.D., but the father’s parents also help him with W.D. 

[109]                     For these reasons, I disagree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that biology must be a tie-breaker when two parties are otherwise equal under this legislation. A court is not obliged to turn to biology and engage in a fraught determination of who may be a closer blood relative. While biological ties may be relevant in a given case, they will generally carry minimal weight in the assessment of a child’s best interests. 

(3)         Biology Does Not Carry Significant Weight in This Case

[110]                     The hearing judge made no error in her approach to the father’s biological tie to W.D. The record did not enable the hearing judge to assign even limited weight to this factor. Both parties are “parents” under the Child Protection Act and each have a biological tie to W.D. Nothing in the record enabled the hearing judge to place greater weight on the father’s biological relationship. I would add, in this case, the father also did not argue that his biological tie was relevant to considerations related to aboriginality, culture, heritage or race.

[111]                     The hearing judge did not fail to consider W.D.’s bond with his father or fail to hear the father’s argument. She clearly knew of this relationship and in assessing W.D.’s best interests, she expressly noted that W.D. “loves and appears to feel secure” with his father and his father’s family (para. 205).

[112]                     Finally, the hearing judge was not compelled to decide in favour of the father after concluding the two parties were more or less equal. It was open to her to dispose of this case based on a factor that she considered more significant: the question of which parent was more likely to maintain the W.D.’s relationship with the other parent.

VI.         Disposition

[113]                     Pursuant to this Court’s judgment issued from the bench on December 2, 2021, and for the above reasons, the decision of the Prince Edward Island Court of Appeal was set aside and the decision of Key J. to award permanent custody and guardianship to the grandmother pursuant to s. 38(2)(e) of the Child Protection Act was affirmed. W.D. was to remain with the father until March 21, 2022 and thereafter be returned to P.E.I. at the expense of the Director. The appeal was allowed with costs throughout to the grandmother.

[114]                     The Court’s judgment affirming the permanent custody and guardianship to the grandmother under s. 38(2)(e) of the Child Protection Act is binding and enforceable.

 

                    Appeal allowed with cost throughout.

I.               Overview

[1]                             The circumstances giving rise to this appeal are tragic and abhorrent. The respondent, Kevin Eric Goforth, was convicted by a jury of unlawful act manslaughter and unlawfully causing bodily harm. The convictions were in relation to Mr. Goforth’s two young foster children. The older child died as a result of a brain injury that developed following a cardiac arrest caused by malnutrition and dehydration. The younger child was severely ill due to malnutrition and dehydration, but she survived. Both children had bruises, abrasions, and lesions on their bodies. The main issue in this appeal is whether the jury was properly instructed such that it was able to find that Mr. Goforth had the requisite mens rea.

[2]                             A majority of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan allowed Mr. Goforth’s appeal, set aside his convictions, and ordered a new trial. The majority found that the trial judge had erred in two principal ways. First, the trial judge erred in describing the mens rea requirement for failing to provide necessaries of life, which was the predicate offence for both manslaughter and unlawfully causing bodily harm. Second, she erred in failing to review and to instruct the jury on the evidence of Mr. Goforth’s parenting circumstances as a secondary caregiver.

[3]                             In my view, the majority of the Court of Appeal erred by failing to take a functional approach in its assessment of the jury charge. This Court has long held that an accused is entitled to a jury that is properly — and not necessarily perfectly — instructed. The ultimate question in this appeal is whether the jury was properly instructed such that appellate intervention was unwarranted. In my view, while the charge was not perfect, the jury was nonetheless properly instructed. None of the issues raised in connection with the jury charge warranted appellate intervention.

[4]                             At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court allowed the appeal and restored the convictions, with reasons to follow. These are the reasons.

II.            Facts

[5]                             On November 8, 2011, two young girls were placed in foster care with Mr. Goforth and his wife, Tammy Goforth, after having previously spent over a year and a half in temporary care with other foster parents. The Goforths had been identified as a possible permanent placement for the children. At the time they were placed in the care of the Goforths, the children were three and two years old. Neither child had any major health concerns prior to the placement. A child protection worker had described the girls as being “fairly pudgy”, “very full‑faced”, and “full‑cheeked” in appearance (A.R., vol. III, at p. 141). She had also described the older child’s disposition as “warm”, “affectionate”, and “very happy” (p. 154). A previous foster parent had described the younger child’s disposition as “bubbly” and “happy” (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 232).

[6]                             On the night of July 31, 2012, approximately nine months after the girls entered their care, the Goforths took the older child to the hospital. The attending pediatrician in the intensive care unit testified at trial that the older child was very sick. She was in cardiac arrest and was not breathing. It took hospital staff 15 minutes to resuscitate her heart. She was severely emaciated and dehydrated. Her weight was significantly below the third percentile for children of her age and gender. She had multiple bruises and abrasions on her body. She was placed on a life support machine as she was not capable of breathing on her own. She was also in renal failure, likely due to severe dehydration.

[7]                             Despite continued treatment over the next day and a half, the older child’s condition showed no signs of improvement and she was declared brain dead. She was taken off life support and died on August 2, 2012. The cause of her death, as set out in the Agreed Statement of Facts, was “diffuse hypoxic/ischemic brain injury that developed following a cardiac arrest on July 31, 2012, secondary to malnutrition and dehydration” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 171).

[8]                             Given the horrific state of the older child, the police were called shortly after her admission to the hospital. The police subsequently found the younger child and she was admitted to hospital early in the morning on August 1, 2012. She was similarly emaciated, malnourished, and dehydrated. Her weight was also under the third percentile for children of her age and gender. She had increased body hair, which was a condition the attending pediatrician had previously seen in patients with anorexia nervosa and which, she explained in her testimony at trial, was a way the body could insulate itself after fat stores had been lost. In addition, the younger child had pneumonia, a urinary tract infection, and a large ulcer on her lower left leg with signs of infection. She also had bruises on her face, open sores and abrasions on the lower spine, and wrap‑around lesions on her wrists and ankles.

[9]                             Mr. and Ms. Goforth were both ultimately charged with, and were jointly tried for, second degree murder (Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, s. 235) in relation to the death of the older child and unlawfully causing bodily harm (s. 269(a)) in relation to the younger child. Unlawful act manslaughter (s. 222(5)(a)) was a lesser and included offence in the second degree murder charges. All of the offences required the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the two accused had committed an unlawful act. The unlawful act alleged by the Crown was failure to provide necessaries of life as set out in s. 215(2) of the Criminal Code.

[10]                        Section 215 imposes a legal duty on certain persons to provide necessaries of life to another person and sets out the corresponding offence for failure without lawful excuse to perform that duty. It states:

215 (1) Every one is under a legal duty

 

(a) as a parent, foster parent, guardian or head of a family, to provide necessaries of life for a child under the age of sixteen years;

 

(b) to provide necessaries of life to their spouse or common‑law partner; and

 

(c) to provide necessaries of life to a person under his charge if that person

 

(i) is unable, by reason of detention, age, illness, mental disorder or other cause, to withdraw himself from that charge, and

 

(ii) is unable to provide himself with necessaries of life.

 

(2) Every person commits an offence who, being under a legal duty within the meaning of subsection (1), fails without lawful excuse to perform that duty, if

 

(a) with respect to a duty imposed by paragraph (1)(a) or (b),

 

(i) the person to whom the duty is owed is in destitute or necessitous circumstances, or

 

(ii) the failure to perform the duty endangers the life of the person to whom the duty is owed, or causes or is likely to cause the health of that person to be endangered permanently; or

 

(b) with respect to a duty imposed by paragraph (1)(c), the failure to perform the duty endangers the life of the person to whom the duty is owed or causes or is likely to cause the health of that person to be injured permanently.

[11]                        The jury convicted Ms. Goforth of second degree murder and unlawfully causing bodily harm. Because her subsequent appeal was unanimously dismissed by the Court of Appeal, there is no appeal in relation to Ms. Goforth before this Court.

[12]                        The jury acquitted Mr. Goforth of second degree murder but convicted him of the lesser and included offence of unlawful act manslaughter. He was also convicted of unlawfully causing bodily harm. Mr. Goforth appealed his convictions.

III.         Decision Below

[13]                        The majority of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan allowed Mr. Goforth’s appeal, set aside his convictions, and ordered a new trial (2021 SKCA 20, 400 C.C.C. (3d) 1). The majority held that the trial judge had erred in her explanation to the jury of the legal elements of s. 215 and in how she related the evidence to those elements.

[14]                        In the majority’s view, the trial judge did not properly convey the mens rea requirement for the predicate offence under s. 215 — failing to provide necessaries of life. When explaining the essential elements of s. 215, the trial judge confusingly introduced two different standards relating to the required foreseeability of harm. As a result, the jury may have concluded that, in order to find that Mr. Goforth committed the predicate offence under s. 215, the Crown only had to prove that a reasonable person in the circumstances would have foreseen the risk of bodily harm beyond the trivial or transitory. This is less stringent than the standard required for s. 215, which is that a reasonable person in the circumstances must have foreseen the risk of death or permanent health impairment. The error was compounded by the trial judge’s failure to explain what is meant by a marked departure from the conduct of a reasonably prudent person in the circumstances.

[15]                        The majority also found that the trial judge had erred in relating the evidence to the mens rea requirement. Although personal characteristics of an accused short of incapacity are irrelevant in assessing the objective mens rea requirement for s. 215, the actual circumstances of an accused bear on whether their conduct is a marked departure from the standard of care expected of a reasonably prudent person. When reviewing the evidence relevant to mens rea for the jury, the trial judge referred only to a very limited subset of the evidence. Although a more complete summary of the evidence was provided at other times in the charge, the failure to refer to the evidence of Mr. Goforth’s parenting and work circumstances when discussing mens rea created the real possibility that the jury would have been led to believe that evidence of Mr. Goforth’s circumstances was irrelevant to assessing mens rea.

[16]                        In dissent, Caldwell J.A. would have dismissed the appeal. With respect to the trial judge’s instruction on the mens rea requirement for s. 215, Caldwell J.A. acknowledged that the foresight requirement for manslaughter was intermingled in the trial judge’s discussion of the foresight requirement for the predicate offence under s. 215. However, he found that the trial judge had stated the law correctly — albeit somewhat confusingly. The lower foresight standard was routinely introduced as a “further” requirement that the Crown had to prove. When the trial judge’s instructions were read as a whole, there was no reasonable possibility that they misled the jury or caused it to misunderstand what the Crown had to prove. Further, Caldwell J.A. found that “no reasonable juror could have concluded both that (a) Mr. [Goforth] ought to have foreseen the risk of bodily harm beyond the trivial or transitory, and yet (b) there was no objectively foreseeable risk of death or permanent endangerment of health in the circumstances” (para. 102).

[17]                        Caldwell J.A. rejected the argument that the trial judge had failed to recount the evidence of Mr. Goforth’s circumstances to the jury. At trial, Mr. Goforth’s position was that neither he nor his wife had deprived the children of food or fluids. This position was inconsistent with Mr. Goforth’s position on appeal. On appeal, he argued that his wife’s primary role in the household constituted a circumstance that had rendered him unable to foresee the risks posed by his own failure to provide necessaries of life to the children. In the view of Caldwell J.A., Mr. Goforth’s position on appeal “was patently precluded from being put to the jury by the position he took at trial and, regardless, would have been overwhelmed by the uncontroverted evidence of the children’s deplorable physical condition” (para. 75). The argument, in effect, was that a reasonable parent in the circumstances of his spousal relationship would not have been aware that the children had been neglected, were starving, and required medical attention. Caldwell J.A. found that Mr. Goforth’s spousal relationship was personal to him and was irrelevant to the objective mens rea requirement in s. 215.

[18]                        With regard to Ms. Goforth, the Court of Appeal was unanimous in dismissing her appeal. Ms. Goforth appealed only her conviction for second degree murder, arguing that there was an inconsistency between her conviction on that charge and Mr. Goforth’s acquittal. Although the impugned mens rea instruction was repeated in relation to the charges against Ms. Goforth, there were no concerns about whether the jury was potentially confused about the required foreseeability standard. In the context of Ms. Goforth’s conviction for second degree murder, the jury must have been satisfied either that Ms. Goforth meant to cause the older child’s death or that she meant to cause the older child bodily harm that she knew was likely to cause death and she was reckless as to whether death ensued or not (Criminal Code, s. 229(a)). By necessary implication, the jury’s conclusion amounted to a finding that Ms. Goforth met the requisite foresight standard for s. 215.

IV.         Issues on Appeal

[19]                        The following issues must be considered in this appeal:

(1)     Did the trial judge err by improperly instructing the jury on the mens rea requirement for s. 215 (failure to provide necessaries of life)? Specifically, did the trial judge err by intermingling the required foreseeability standard for s. 215 with the required foreseeability standard for manslaughter or unlawfully causing bodily harm?

(2)     Did the trial judge err by failing to instruct the jury on Mr. Goforth’s circumstances as a secondary caregiver during the mens rea instruction for s. 215?

(3)     Did the trial judge err by failing to explain what is meant by a marked departure from the conduct of a reasonably prudent person in the circumstances?

(4)     If the trial judge erred, can the curative proviso be applied?

V.           Analysis

A.           Standard of Review

[20]                        The alleged errors in this case pertain to the trial judge’s charge to the jury. As I stated above, this Court has long held that an accused is entitled to a jury that is properly — and not necessarily perfectly — instructed (R. v. Daley, 2007 SCC 53, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 523, at para. 31; R. v. Jacquard, 1997 CanLII 374 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at paras. 2 and 32).

[21]                        Trial judges are not held to a standard of perfection in crafting jury instructions (Daley, at para. 31). Rather, an appellate court must take a functional approach when reviewing a jury charge by examining the alleged errors in the context of the evidence, the entire charge, and the trial as a whole (R. v. Calnen, 2019 SCC 6, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 301, at para. 8; R. v. Pickton, 2010 SCC 32, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 198, at para. 10; R. v. Jaw, 2009 SCC 42, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 26, at para. 32). It is the substance of the charge — and not adherence to or departure from a prescriptive formula — that is determinative (R. v. Barton, 2019 SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579, at para. 54; R. v. Luciano, 2011 ONCA 89, 273 O.A.C. 273, at para. 69). As Bastarache J. instructed in Daley, at para. 30:

. . . it is important for appellate courts to keep in mind the following. The cardinal rule is that it is the general sense which the words used must have conveyed, in all probability, to the mind of the jury that matters, and not whether a particular formula was recited by the judge. The particular words used, or the sequence followed, is a matter within the discretion of the trial judge and will depend on the particular circumstances of the case. [Emphasis added.]

[22]                        Indeed, trial judges must be afforded some flexibility in crafting the language of jury instructions, as their role requires them to “decant and simplify” the law and evidence for the jury (Jacquard, at para. 13; R. v. Rodgerson, 2015 SCC 38, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 760, at para. 50; see also R. v. Araya, 2015 SCC 11, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 581, at para. 39).

B.            Did the Trial Judge Err by Improperly Instructing the Jury on the Mens Rea Requirement for Section 215 (Failure to Provide Necessaries of Life)? Specifically, Did the Trial Judge Err by Intermingling the Required Foreseeability Standard for Section 215 With the Required Foreseeability Standard for Manslaughter or Unlawfully Causing Bodily Harm?

[23]                        The Crown argues that the trial judge did not err in her charge regarding the mens rea requirement for s. 215. The jury charge addressed the objective foreseeability requirements for both manslaughter and the predicate offence. Although the charge juxtaposed these two foreseeability standards, there is no reasonable possibility that the jury would have thought the Crown only had to satisfy the lower foreseeability standard relating to manslaughter.

[24]                        Mr. Goforth, on the other hand, submits that the majority of the Court of Appeal was correct to find that the trial judge’s instruction on the mens rea required for s. 215 was deficient. According to him, the majority functionally reviewed the jury charge and correctly concluded that the charge was inadequate because it confused the two foreseeability standards.

[25]                        For the reasons that follow, I would reject Mr. Goforth’s submission. Although the jury charge was not perfect, a functional reading of it shows that the jury was properly instructed.

(1)         The Mens Rea Requirements

[26]                        Mr. Goforth was charged with second degree murder and unlawfully causing bodily harm. Unlawful act manslaughter was a lesser and included offence in the second degree murder charge. All of these charges were predicated on the alleged failure to provide the children concerned with necessaries of life contrary to s. 215. The mens rea requirement for both manslaughter and unlawfully causing bodily harm is the same. Both offences require the mens rea of the predicate offence, which in this case is the mens rea for s. 215, as well as objective foresight that the unlawful act could cause bodily harm beyond the trivial or transitory (R. v. Creighton, 1993 CanLII 61 (SCC), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 3, at p. 44; R. v. DeSousa, 1992 CanLII 80 (SCC), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 944, at p. 961).

[27]                        Section 215 creates a penal negligence offence. It is “aimed at establishing a uniform minimum level of care to be provided for those to whom it applies, and this can only be achieved if those under the duty are held to a societal, rather than a personal, standard of conduct” (R. v. Naglik, 1993 CanLII 64 (SCC), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 122, at p. 141 (emphasis deleted)). Liability is premised on what a reasonable person in the accused’s position would have known or foreseen, so “fault lies in the absence of the requisite mental state of care” (R. v. Beatty, 2008 SCC 5, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49, at para. 8). The provision punishes conduct that is a marked departure from an objectively reasonable standard of care. More specifically, the mens rea requirement for s. 215 is established when the Crown proves that the accused’s conduct constitutes “a marked departure from the conduct of a reasonably prudent parent in circumstances where it was objectively foreseeable that the failure to provide the necessaries of life would lead to a risk of danger to the life, or a risk of permanent endangerment to the health, of the child” (Naglik, at p. 143; see also R. v. J.F., 2008 SCC 60, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 215, at para. 8).

[28]                        In R. v. Roy, 2012 SCC 26, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 60, at para. 36, Cromwell J. provided a useful analytical framework for assessing whether objective mens rea has been made out:

It is helpful to approach the issue by asking two questions. The first is whether, in light of all the relevant evidence, a reasonable person would have foreseen the risk and taken steps to avoid it if possible. If so, the second question is whether the accused’s failure to foresee the risk and take steps to avoid it, if possible, was a marked departure from the standard of care expected of a reasonable person in the accused’s circumstances. [Emphasis in original.]

[29]                        In this case, the Crown needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Goforth had the requisite mens rea for the predicate offence under s. 215 as well as the requisite mens rea for the offences of manslaughter and unlawfully causing bodily harm.

[30]                        In order to satisfy the mens rea requirement for s. 215, the Crown needed to prove that (a) it was objectively foreseeable, to a reasonable person in the circumstances of the accused, that the failure to provide food, fluids, or medical care would lead to a risk of danger to the life, or a risk of permanent endangerment to the health, of the children; and that (b) the accused’s conduct represented a marked departure from the conduct expected of a reasonably prudent parent, foster parent, guardian, or head of a family in the circumstances.

[31]                        In order to satisfy the mens rea requirement for either manslaughter or unlawfully causing bodily harm, the Crown needed to prove — in addition to establishing the mens rea for s. 215 — that it was objectively foreseeable, to a reasonable person in the circumstances of the accused, that the failure to provide necessaries of life to the children would lead to a risk of bodily harm which was neither trivial nor transitory (Creighton, at pp. 44‑45). This is a lower foreseeability standard than what is required for s. 215, as the foreseeability of death or of permanent endangerment to health is not required. Therefore, when the offence under s. 215 is the predicate offence for either manslaughter or unlawfully causing bodily harm, if the Crown proves the requisite mens rea requirement for s. 215, then, by necessary implication, the additional mens rea requirement for manslaughter or unlawfully causing bodily harm will be satisfied.

(2)         The Charge Functionally Conveyed the Mens Rea Requirements

[32]                        The majority of the Court of Appeal concluded that the following instruction could have confused the jury about the appropriate standard for mens rea:

The Crown must establish beyond a reasonable doubt the essential elements of an offence under section 215(2), its external circumstances and the mental or fault element. The accused’s conduct must also constitute a marked departure from that of a reasonable person in the same circumstances. Further, the Crown must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that a reasonable person would foresee the risk of bodily harm, beyond the trivial or transitory, in the context of dangerous conduct. [Emphasis added.]

 

(A.R., vol. I, at p. 154)

This instruction was repeated numerous times in the jury charge, in relation to both counts of the indictment, with slight variations (see, e.g., A.R., vol. I, at pp. 173‑74, 175, 252 and 254‑55).

[33]                        In the assessment of whether the jury would have been confused about the appropriate foreseeability standard, it is important to note that the trial judge also clearly and correctly summarized the required mens rea for s. 215 in a different portion of the charge. When specifically discussing whether Mr. Goforth had the requisite mens rea for s. 215 in relation to the older child, the trial judge instructed the jury as follows:

Did Kevin Goforth’s failure to provide the necessaries of life to [the older child] represent a marked departure from the standard of conduct of a reasonably prudent person in the circumstances where it is objectively foreseeable that the failure to provide food or fluids or the failure to seek medical attention would lead to a risk of danger to life or a risk of permanent endangerment to the child’s health?

 

These further considerations can be transformed into questions for you to consider.

 

A) Was it objectively foreseeable that the failure to provide [the older child] with food or fluids or the failure to seek medical attention for [the older child] would lead to a risk of danger to life or a risk of permanent endangerment to [the older child’s] health?

 

B) If so, did Kevin’s failure to provide [the older child] with food or fluids or to seek medical attention represent a marked departure from the standard of conduct of a reasonably prudent person in the circumstances?

 

(A.R., vol. I, at p. 172)

A similar instruction — albeit more abridged — was provided about whether Mr. Goforth had the requisite mens rea for s. 215 in relation to the younger child.

[34]                        The questions posed by the trial judge in the above passage adhere to the two-step inquiry discussed by Cromwell J. in Roy, at para. 36 (see also Naglik, at pp. 143‑44).

[35]                        Ultimately, when read as a whole, the trial judge’s instructions functionally conveyed the necessary legal principles. The jury charge was not perfect. The trial judge did not make a clear distinction between the required foreseeability standard for s. 215 and the required foreseeability standard for manslaughter or unlawfully causing bodily harm. She routinely juxtaposed the two different foreseeability requirements without clearly alerting the jury to how the respective foresight standards corresponded to the respective offences.

[36]                        The imprecise juxtaposition of different mens rea requirements should be avoided. It could potentially confuse the jury and could potentially necessitate a new trial in a different set of circumstances. However, in the circumstances of this case, there is no reasonable possibility that the jury was confused about the required mens rea for s. 215 or misled about what the Crown had to prove in order for the jury to find Mr. Goforth guilty of either manslaughter or unlawfully causing bodily harm. With respect, the Court of Appeal erred in holding otherwise, for three reasons.

[37]                        First, despite the frequency with which the more confusing instruction was repeated, the clearest explanation of the mens rea requirement was provided when the trial judge invited the jury to consider two straightforward questions to assess whether that requirement had been met. These questions told the jurors exactly what to ask themselves in the circumstances of this case. There is simply no reasonable possibility that any juror would have disregarded these straightforward questions and would have instead chosen to apply the lower foresight standard.

[38]                        Second, the fact that the impugned instruction was routinely introduced with the word “further” also supports the argument that the jury would have simply concluded that both foresight standards had to be satisfied.

[39]                        Finally, I note that defence counsel did not object to the charge at trial and that appellate counsel before the Court of Appeal did not initially identify the juxtaposition of the two foreseeability standards as an issue of concern (C.A. reasons, at paras. 93‑94). Although not determinative, defence counsel’s failure to object at trial and appellate counsel’s failure to identify the issue initially on appeal undermine the argument that the jury may have been misled or confused about the appropriate standard. Indeed, contrary to the opinion of my colleague (at para. 65), this provides a strong reason to conclude that the jury would not have been misled or confused. As Bastarache J. explained in Daley, at para. 58:

. . . it is expected of counsel that they will assist the trial judge and identify what in their opinion is problematic with the judge’s instructions to the jury. While not decisive, failure of counsel to object is a factor in appellate review. The failure to register a complaint about the aspect of the charge that later becomes the ground for the appeal may be indicative of the seriousness of the alleged violation. See Jacquard, at para. 38: “In my opinion, defence counsel’s failure to object to the charge says something about both the overall accuracy of the jury instructions and the seriousness of the alleged misdirection.”

 

(See also Calnen, at paras. 38-39; Thériault v. The Queen, 1981 CanLII 180 (SCC), [1981] 1 S.C.R. 336, at pp. 343-44.)

[40]                        In sum, when the jury charge is read functionally and as a whole, I have no trouble concluding that the jury was properly instructed on the law and able to draw the necessary legal conclusions.

C.            Did the Trial Judge Err by Failing to Instruct the Jury on Mr. Goforth’s Circumstances as a Secondary Caregiver During the Mens Rea Instruction for Section 215?

[41]                        The law is clear that personal characteristics of an accused, short of incapacity, are irrelevant in assessing objective mens rea (Creighton, at p. 61). In Creighton, the majority of this Court rejected the view that “individual excusing conditions” (p. 63) such as educational, experiential, and “habitual” characteristics of an accused may be taken into account (p. 61). Consideration of personal characteristics, short of incapacity, injects subjectivity into the objective test, which undermines the purpose of having a single and uniform minimum legal standard of care (pp. 61 and 70). This is not to say that the reasonable person is placed in a factual vacuum. “While the legal duty of the accused is not particularized by his or her personal characteristics short of incapacity, it is particularized in application by the nature of the activity and the circumstances surrounding the accused’s failure to take the requisite care” (p. 71; see also R. v. Javanmardi, 2019 SCC 54, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 36‑38). The reasonable person is therefore placed in the relevant circumstances of the accused. These circumstances “do not personalize the objective standard; they contextualize it” (D. M. Paciocco, “Subjective and Objective Standards of Fault for Offences and Defences” (1995), 59 Sask. L. Rev. 271, at p. 285).

[42]                        The issue that arises in this appeal is whether Mr. Goforth’s alleged status as a secondary caregiver is a relevant circumstance or an irrelevant personal characteristic. The Crown argues that Mr. Goforth’s role in the household, his belief that his wife had everything well in hand, and his work schedule were irrelevant to the assessment of the objective mens rea for s. 215. Mr. Goforth argues that the trial judge failed to adequately instruct the jury on his circumstances as the less involved parent, which deprived the jury of critical information about whether he had the capacity to foresee the risk of harm to the girls.

[43]                        The majority of the Court of Appeal highlighted evidence relating to five circumstances that it believed were “critical to the question as to whether Mr. [Goforth] had the necessary moral culpability”: (a) his alleged lack of involvement in providing necessaries for the girls; (b) his alleged reliance on Ms. Goforth as the person who would feed and clothe the girls and see to their needs; (c) the girls’ history of recurring illness and recovery under the care of Ms. Goforth; (d) his alleged limited interactions with the girls, including that he never saw them unclothed; and (e) his evidence that the girls were picky eaters but that he observed them eating and drinking and they were never refused either food or drink (para. 199).

[44]                        In contrast to the majority, Caldwell J.A., in dissent, held that “the nature or characteristics of Mr. [Goforth]’s relationship with his spouse are ‘individualized excusing conditions’” and that, as a result, “Mr. [Goforth]’s spousal relationship is personal to him and . . . is not relevant in an objective mens rea inquiry” (paras. 108‑9).

[45]                        With respect, neither the majority nor the dissent in the Court of Appeal accurately characterized the relevant circumstances in this case. The dissent, on the one hand, described the relevant circumstances too narrowly. The existence or nature of a spousal relationship can be considered a relevant circumstance — the circumstances of a single parent may be significantly different than the circumstances of a parent in a two-parent home. Similarly, the work schedule and physical absence of one parent may be a relevant circumstance, depending on the particular factual matrix.

[46]                        The majority, on the other hand, adopted an overly broad conceptualization of circumstances. Contrary to the majority’s conclusion, Mr. Goforth’s “alleged lack of involvement in providing necessaries for the girls” is not a circumstance in which the reasonable person needed to be placed (C.A. reasons, at para. 199). Indeed, given that Mr. Goforth was physically in the children’s presence on a daily basis, his alleged lack of involvement in providing necessaries for them cannot be characterized as a circumstance. Rather, it constitutes an essential element of the actus reus. Mr. Goforth had a duty to provide necessaries of life to the children. His utter neglect of them is not a circumstance that can ground his failure to foresee the risk of harm.

[47]                        I acknowledge that the other four purported circumstances (listed in (b) to (e) at para. 43, above) could be legally relevant. However, contrary to the conclusion of the majority of the Court of Appeal, none of these circumstances were “critical” to the jury’s assessment of Mr. Goforth’s “moral culpability”. Indeed, none of these circumstances were material to the jury’s consideration of whether Mr. Goforth had the requisite foresight to be criminally liable under s. 215. In light of the evidence relating to the children’s deplorable and heart‑wrenching condition, none of these alleged circumstances could have possibly prevented Mr. Goforth from foreseeing the risk of harm to them. According to his own evidence, Mr. Goforth ate dinner with all of the children — the Goforths’ own children and their foster children — almost every evening. He testified that the girls got sick about twice a month but that at no point did he think he or Ms. Goforth should call the doctor or the free health line. He was well positioned to observe their condition, yet he did nothing. The uncontroverted medical evidence presented at trial indicated that both girls suffered from malnutrition over a prolonged period.

[48]                          Accordingly, much of the evidence relating to Mr. Goforth’s circumstances — including his alleged reliance on his wife, his alleged limited interaction with the girls, and the girls’ alleged history of being picky eaters and suffering from illness regularly — was immaterial given the evidence of emaciation and neglect. Any reasonable parent in Mr. Goforth’s circumstances would have foreseen the danger and would have taken action.

[49]                        In any event, the trial judge’s charge sufficiently recited the evidence about Mr. Goforth’s alleged circumstances. As mentioned above, trial judges have a duty to “decant and simplify”, and “there is no need to state evidence twice where once will do” (Jacquard, at paras. 13‑14).

[50]                        The trial judge instructed the jury multiple times on Mr. Goforth’s evidence relating to his busy schedule and his purported status as a secondary caregiver. Although the more detailed description of the evidence was given in portions of the charge that discussed the actus reus, there is no basis to conclude that the trial judge’s comparably brief recitation of the evidence when discussing mens rea would have caused the jury any confusion. When discussing the relevant mens rea evidence in relation to the older child, the trial judge still instructed the jury to “consider the evidence of Tammy and Kevin Goforth” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 173), and then briefly mentioned some of the testimonial evidence. When discussing the relevant mens rea evidence in relation to the younger child, the trial judge instructed the jury that “the evidence you have already considered on this issue is relevant here” (p. 255). The trial judge’s brevity would not have caused the jury to conclude that only the limited subset of evidence specifically mentioned was relevant.

[51]                        The trial judge also instructed the jury on Mr. Goforth’s alleged circumstances a final time when outlining the defence theory of the case at the end of her charge. She summarized Mr. Goforth’s position as follows:

Throughout the time in which the children resided with Kevin and Tammy, Kevin was continuously employed as a carpenter in Regina that required him to work six days per week at approximately 10‑12 hours per day. Kevin was not the primary caregiver for the children. While he focussed on providing monetary support for the family, meals, bathing and clothing of the children was a responsibility of Tammy’s.

 

(A.R., vol. I, at p. 263)

[52]                          Again, defence counsel’s failure to object to the jury charge is significant. It belies the argument that the trial judge’s decision not to repeat evidence in an already lengthy jury charge constituted an error. As Binnie J. stated in R. v. Royz, 2009 SCC 13, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 423, at para. 3: “Lack of objection is not fatal, but it may be informative, because defence counsel would have understood that additional evidentiary matters reviewed at his request might result in the judge repeating additional portions of the evidence requested by the prosecution on the same point, which might in the end have been expected to be more prejudicial than helpful to the defence.”

[53]                        Overall, the jury was well aware of all the circumstances that Mr. Goforth argued prevented him from foreseeing the risk of harm to the children. Indeed, on any reasonable view of the case, this, more than anything else, would appear to explain why Ms. Goforth was convicted of second degree murder whereas Mr. Goforth was convicted of unlawful act manslaughter. I have no hesitation in concluding that the jury was properly instructed and that it rightly rejected Mr. Goforth’s defence that his circumstances prevented him from foreseeing the risk of harm to the children.

D.           Did the Trial Judge Err by Failing to Explain What Is Meant by a Marked Departure From the Conduct of a Reasonably Prudent Person in the Circumstances?

[54]                        On appeal to this Court, Mr. Goforth reiterates that the trial judge’s failure to explain the meaning of the term “marked departure” also left the jury ill‑equipped to apply the mens rea standard. Mr. Goforth argues that this case is analogous to R. v. Stephan, 2017 ABCA 380, 423 D.L.R. (4th) 56, rev’d 2018 SCC 21, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 633. In Stephan, this Court ordered a new trial because the trial judge, among other things, “did not sufficiently explain the concept of marked departure in a way that the jury could understand and apply it” (para. 2).

[55]                        I do not agree with this submission. In the circumstances of this case, a new trial is not warranted simply because the trial judge did not explain the meaning of the term “marked departure”. This case is easily distinguishable from Stephan, in which this Court agreed with O’Ferrall J.A. that the trial judge had erred by failing to describe what is meant by this term. In Stephan, the alleged marked departure pertained to the conduct of parents who relied on naturopathic and home remedies to treat their child’s suspected meningitis. In that case, the trial judge was required to explain more thoroughly what a marked departure was due to the difficulty of assessing whether the parents’ conduct in the circumstances constituted a marked departure — hindsight is not the same as foresight. Moreover, there was an additional concern in Stephan that the jury may have thought that a reasonable parent should react more like a medical professional since there was a large body of expert medical evidence.

[56]                        There are no such concerns with respect to Mr. Goforth. The alleged marked departure in this case relates to whether a reasonable person would have foreseen that failing to provide food or fluids to young children — one of whom ultimately died as a result of brain injury that developed following a cardiac arrest caused by malnutrition and dehydration — would result in a risk of danger to life or of permanent endangerment to health. Given this context, the jury was easily able to assess whether the failure to provide food or fluids to young children constituted a marked departure from the standard of care of a reasonably prudent person in the circumstances.

[57]                        Again, the fact that Mr. Goforth failed to object to the jury charge and request an instruction on the meaning of “marked departure” speaks volumes. It was simply not in his interest to do so and it was inconsistent with his defence at trial — namely, that neither he nor his wife ever denied food or fluids to the children and that medical attention was not required up until the time they took the older child to the hospital.

[58]                        My colleague is incorrect to assert that I am, in substance, applying the curative proviso. It must be remembered that the “adequacy of the jury instructions must be assessed in the context of the evidence and the trial as a whole” (Pickton, at para. 10). Jury charges may therefore focus on what is “actually and realistically at issue in the case” (para. 10). The charge in this case was adequate because, based on the evidence and the trial as a whole, there was no issue as to whether the failure to provide food or fluids to young children constituted a marked departure — it was not a “difficult concept” to understand or apply in the circumstances. Furthermore, I would reiterate what Dickson C.J. stated in R. v. Corbett, 1988 CanLII 80 (SCC), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, at pp. 693‑94:

We should maintain our strong faith in juries which have, in the words of Sir William Holdsworth, “for some hundreds of years been constantly bringing the rules of law to the touchstone of contemporary common sense” (Holdsworth, A History of English Law (7th ed. 1956), vol. I, at p. 349).

Jurors do not check their common sense at the door of the deliberation room. Given the evidence and the circumstances of the trial as a whole, I am confident that the jury in this case was well‑equipped to make a common sense assessment of whether failing to provide food or fluids to young children constituted a marked departure from the conduct of a reasonably prudent person.

E.            If the Trial Judge Erred, Can the Curative Proviso Be Applied?

[59]                        In light of my conclusion that the jury charge functionally conveyed the necessary law and evidence to the jury, it is not necessary to resort to the application of the curative proviso.

VI.         Disposition

[60]                        The appeal is allowed, the convictions are restored, and the sentence appeal is remitted to the Court of Appeal.

                    Brown J. —

[61]                        I agree with my colleagues that the appeal should be allowed. But I do not accept that the jury charge, when viewed from the “functional perspective” required by the jurisprudence, “properly . . . equipped [the jury] to decide the case” according to law (R. v. Barton, 2019 SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579, at para. 54).

[62]                        At many points ⸺ five, by my colleagues’ count, which I accept ⸺ this jury charge misstated an essential element of the offence that comprised the central issue, being whether the Crown had established the mens rea for the offence of failing to provide the necessaries of life. Yet, in concluding that the charge was “functionally” adequate, my colleagues point to a single instance, in “a different portion of the charge”, in which “the trial judge . . . clearly and correctly summarized the required mens rea” (para. 33). This, they say, was “the clearest explanation of the mens rea requirement” (para. 37).

[63]                        What my colleagues do not account for, however, is that, merely because they have the insight to distinguish the single correct instruction from the repeated incorrect instructions, it does not follow that the jury had that insight. This charge may have been “functionally” adequate from the standpoint of a reviewing court searching for a correct instruction. But that is not the same thing as a charge that is “functionally” adequate for the purposes of a jury knowing the law that it must apply to the evidence. There is no reason to suppose that this jury could possibly have known to single out that single correct instruction as the one to follow, and to ignore the five incorrect instructions as mere distractions. That my colleagues observe that the single correct instruction was “the clearest explanation” is of no significance, either, since that observation is informed by their proper understanding of the law ⸺ an understanding which this jury did not have, which is precisely the problem.

[64]                        In any event, focusing on one correct instruction interspersed with five incorrect instructions fails to take a functional approach to the charge. The functional approach requires the charge to be read as a whole and asks whether an appellate court can be satisfied that the jury would have adequately understood the issues involved, the law relating to the charge the accused was facing, and the evidence to be considered in resolving the issues (R. v. Jacquard, 1997 CanLII 374 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at para. 54; R. v. Daley, 2007 SCC 53, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 523, at para. 31; R. v. Cooper, 1993 CanLII 147 (SCC), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 146, at p. 163; R. v. Calnen, 2019 SCC 6, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 301, at para. 8). My colleagues claim to be applying Daley’s “cardinal rule” that “it is the general sense which the words used must have conveyed, in all probability, to the mind of the jury that matters, and not whether a particular formula was recited by the judge” (Daley, at para. 30 (emphasis added)). Of course, the words used in the charge need not represent some formulaic statement of the applicable law. But they must be an accurate statement of the law, and the jury must not be left to, in effect, cobble together its own charge by guessing correctly about which part of the charge to follow and which part to disregard. Applying that standard, it is simply not possible to say that this charge passes muster.

[65]                        My colleagues also place great weight on the single use of the word “further”, in a lengthy, convoluted charge (para. 38). The significance they ascribe to it is, with respect, hardly obvious. As for their stress upon counsel not having objected to the charge, and again with respect, this Court has repeatedly observed that trial counsel’s failure to object, while a consideration, is not determinative (Barton, at para. 48; Daley, at para. 58; Jacquard, at para. 37; R. v. Arcangioli, 1994 CanLII 107 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 129, at pp. 142‑43; Thériault v. The Queen, 1981 CanLII 180 (SCC), [1981] 1 S.C.R. 336, at pp. 343‑44; Cullen v. The King, 1949 CanLII 7 (SCC), [1949] S.C.R. 658, at p. 664). My colleagues concede this (at para. 39), but do not acknowledge the point that underlies why counsel’s failure to object is not determinative: ultimately, it is the trial judge who is responsible for the charge.

[66]                        Remarkably, my colleagues maintain (at paras. 55‑56) that this charge was adequate despite the trial judge not sufficiently explaining the concept of a marked departure for the mens rea of failing to provide the necessaries of life, and despite this Court in R. v. Stephan, 2018 SCC 21, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 633, rev’g 2017 ABCA 380, 423 D.L.R. (4th) 56, having ordered a new trial on precisely the basis that the “difficult concept” of a marked departure had not been properly explained to the jury (Stephan (C.A.), at para. 247). They say, however, that there is no concern here because the jury, “[g]iven the evidence and the circumstances of the trial as a whole” (para. 58), was “easily able to assess whether the failure to provide food or fluids to young children constituted a marked departure from the standard of care of a reasonably prudent person in the circumstances” (para. 56). But this is not the same thing as saying that the charge was adequate. In substance, and their protestations to the contrary notwithstanding, my colleagues are applying the curative proviso.

[67]                        The matter comes down to this. By commingling, confusing and “routinely” and with “frequency” (to use my colleagues’ terms at paras. 35 and 37) substituting the differing standards of foreseeability of harm (as between manslaughter and failing to provide the necessaries of life), the trial judge left the jury equipped with a charge that, in critical sections, is not comprehensible to a legally trained reader, let alone to a layperson juror. Compounding the confusion, the jury charge addressed the mens rea under a heading relating to the actus reus. It cannot plausibly be maintained that this charge left the jury equipped to do its job.

[68]                        On this record, however, I am persuaded of the Crown’s submission that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice flowed from the deficient instructions. It is inconceivable, given the extreme form which the failure to provide the necessaries of life took in this case, that the jury would not have found that the Crown had established the more stringent foreseeability requirement applicable to failing to provide the necessaries of life. I would apply the curative proviso, allow the appeal and restore Goforth’s convictions of manslaughter and unlawfully causing bodily harm.

 

                    Appeal allowed.

                    Brown J. —

I.               Introduction and Background

[1]                             This Court has barred access to rectification where sought to achieve retroactive tax planning (Canada (Attorney General) v. Fairmont Hotels Inc., 2016 SCC 56, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 720, at para. 3). Taxpayers should be taxed based on what they actually agreed to do and did, and not on what they could have done or later wished they had done (Fairmont Hotels, at paras. 23‑24, citing Shell Canada Ltd. v. Canada, 1999 CanLII 647 (SCC), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 622, at para. 45). At issue in this appeal is whether taxpayers are also barred from obtaining other equitable relief ⸺ here, rescission of a series of transactions ⸺ sought to avoid unanticipated adverse tax consequences arising from the ordinary operation thereon of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.). As I explain below, they are.

[2]                             In 2008, Todd Collins, principal of Rite‑Way Metals Ltd., and Floyd Cochran, principal of Harvard Industries Ltd., each retained the same tax advisor to propose a plan to protect corporate assets from creditors without incurring income tax liability. The resulting plans took advantage of the attribution rules in s. 75(2) and the inter‑corporate dividend deduction in s. 112(1) of the Act. In each case, a holding company was incorporated to purchase shares in an operating company, a family trust was created with the holding company as a beneficiary, and funds were loaned to the trust to purchase shares in the operating company. The operating companies paid dividends to the trusts, which were attributed to the holding companies under s. 75(2). They, in turn, claimed a deduction in respect of those dividends under s. 112(1). The effect was to move $510,000 from Rite‑Way to the Collins family trust, and $2,085,000 from Harvard to the Cochran family trust, without income tax being paid.

[3]                             The proposals were based in part on the interpretation of the provisions published by the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) at the time.

[4]                             In 2011, however, in Sommerer v. The Queen, 2011 TCC 212, 2011 D.T.C. 1162, aff’d 2012 FCA 207, [2014] 1 F.C.R. 379, the Tax Court of Canada held that the attribution rules in s. 75(2) are inapplicable where the property in question was sold to a trust, as opposed to gifted or settled. Subsequently, the CRA reassessed the respondents’ returns, leading in turn to the issuance of notices of reassessment imposing tax liability upon the respondents in respect of the dividends. The respondents objected, were unsuccessful, then sued for rescission of the transactions leading to and including the payment of dividends.

[5]                             The chambers judge granted rescission, relying on Re Pallen Trust, 2015 BCCA 222, 385 D.L.R. (4th) 499, wherein the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, applying the English test for equitable rescission stated in Pitt v. Holt, [2013] UKSC 26, [2013] 2 A.C. 108, upheld an order rescinding the same types of transactions on the basis of a mistake about their tax consequences (2019 BCSC 1030, [2020] 1 C.T.C. 26). While expressing concern that Re Pallen Trust had been significantly undermined by the decisions of this Court in Fairmont Hotels and its companion case, Jean Coutu Group (PJC) Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2016 SCC 55, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 670, the chambers judge considered himself bound by it. The Court of Appeal affirmed, holding that the chambers judge did not err in applying Re Pallen Trust or in exercising his equitable discretion (2020 BCCA 196, [2021] 1 C.T.C. 153). Fairmont Hotels and Jean Coutu, it said, applied narrowly to preclude rectification; neither stands for the broad preclusion of any equitable remedy in these circumstances, or undermines the authority of Pitt v. Holt.

[6]                             The Attorney General of Canada raises two principal grounds of appeal: first, that the courts below erred in adopting the test for equitable rescission stated in Pitt v. Holt; and secondly (and alternatively), if Pitt v. Holt governs, then they erred in applying it.

[7]                             It suffices to dispose of this matter by allowing the appeal on the first ground. For the reasons that follow, a limiting principle of equity and, relatedly, principles of tax law stated in Fairmont Hotels and Jean Coutu are irreconcilable with the conclusion in Pitt v. Holt. Equity has no place here, there being nothing unconscionable or otherwise unfair about the operation of a tax statute on transactions freely undertaken. It follows that the prohibition against retroactive tax planning, as stated in Fairmont Hotels and Jean Coutu, should be understood broadly, precluding any equitable remedy by which it might be achieved, including rescission.

II.            Analysis

A.           Rescission

[8]                             Respectfully, the Court of Appeal erred by importing reasoning from Pitt v. Holt. Its determination that equity can relieve a tax mistake is incompatible with domestic law, being barred by a limiting principle of equity and by principles of tax law.

[9]                             I turn first to a limiting principle of equity ⸺ indeed, the most fundamental premise of that domain, found in its origins. Equity developed to alleviate results under “an unyielding common law” that called for the relief as a matter of “conscience” and “greater fairness” (J. Berryman, The Law of Equitable Remedies (2nd ed. 2013), at p. 2). Equitable principles “have above all a distinctive ethical quality, reflecting as they do the prevention of unconscionable conduct” (I. C. F. Spry, The Principles of Equitable Remedies: Specific Performance, Injunctions, Rectification and Equitable Damages (9th ed. 2014), at p. 1).

[10]                        This broad scope for courts of equity to give relief also defines its own limits (hence a “limiting” principle): transactions that do not call for relief as a matter of conscience or fairness are properly outside equity’s domain. This is reflected in some of equity’s maxims, including that a person who comes to equity must come with “clean hands” and “he who seeks equity must do equity” (Spry, at pp. 5-6; Berryman, at pp. 16 and 18; Snell’s Equity (34th ed. 2020), by J. McGhee and S. Elliott, at paras. 5‑009 to 5‑010).

[11]                        The jurisdiction of equity to protect against fraud, undue influence, and unconscionable transactions is well settled (McGhee and Elliott, at para. 8‑001; see also G. H. L. Fridman, The Law of Contract in Canada (6th ed. 2011), at p. 762; M. McInnes, The Canadian Law of Unjust Enrichment and Restitution (2014), at p. 1402). Generally speaking, a court of equity may grant relief where it would be unconscionable or unfair to allow the common law to operate in favour of the party seeking enforcement of the transaction. But there is nothing unconscionable or unfair in the ordinary operation of tax statutes to transactions freely agreed upon. As the Court of Appeal for Ontario recognized in Canada Life Insurance Co. of Canada v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 ONCA 562, 141 O.R. (3d) 321, at para. 93, “[t]here is nothing inequitable about [Canada Life] being taxed on ‘what it did’ rather than on what it intended to achieve.” If there is to be a remedy, it lies with Parliament, not a court of equity. On this ground alone, Pitt v. Holt and Re Pallen Trust cannot, in my respectful view, be taken as stating the law of British Columbia.

[12]                        Turning to principles of tax law, the Canadian tax system is based on the Duke of Westminster principle that “taxpayers are entitled to arrange their affairs to minimize the amount of tax payable” (Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, 2005 SCC 54, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 601, at para. 11, citing Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Duke of Westminster, [1936] A.C. 1 (H.L.), quoted in Canada v. Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L., 2021 SCC 49, at para. 29; see also Shell Canada, at para. 46). In Shell Canada, McLachlin J. (as she then was) explained that a court’s role is “to apply an unambiguous provision of the Act to a taxpayer’s transaction” and not to “recharacterize a taxpayer’s bona fide legal relationships” (paras. 39‑40). Courts “do not have the constitutional legitimacy and resources to be tax policy makers” (Alta Energy Luxembourg, at para. 96, citing Canada Trustco, at para. 41). Unless, therefore, a statute says otherwise, taxpayers are to be taxed, in accordance with the applicable tax statute’s ordinary operation, based on what they actually agreed to do, and not on what they could have done (Shell Canada, at para. 45, citing Duha Printers (Western) Ltd. v. Canada, 1998 CanLII 827 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 795, at para. 88; Neuman v. M.N.R., 1998 CanLII 826 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 770, at para. 63).

[13]                        This principle operated in Shell Canada to the taxpayer’s favour, by allowing it to deduct from its taxable income interest at the rate that it had actually paid for borrowing New Zealand dollars under debenture agreements, rather than at the lower rate it would have paid had it instead borrowed US dollars. Absent a “sham” arrangement, “the taxpayer’s legal relationships must be respected in tax cases” (Shell Canada, at para. 39). But the principle operates the other way, too. And so, this Court applied the principle from Shell Canada in Fairmont Hotels and Jean Coutu in concluding that the instruments at issue in those cases could not be rectified (in Fairmont Hotels) or interpreted or retroactively amended (in Jean Coutu) in order to avoid an unanticipated, adverse tax consequence. Again, legal relationships were to be respected even if they appear ill‑considered in hindsight. If, after all, taxpayers may structure their affairs so as to reduce their tax liability, they may also be taken as having structured their affairs in such a way that increased their tax liability.

[14]                        This Court made precisely that point in Fairmont Hotels. “Tax consequences”, it held, “flow from freely chosen legal arrangements, not from the intended or unintended effects of those arrangements, whether upon the taxpayer or upon the public treasury” (para. 24). The inquiry, the Court added, is into what the taxpayer agreed to do, and not into whether the taxpayer or the CRA has obtained a “windfall”.

[15]                        The point was made with even greater force in Jean Coutu. While that appeal was decided under art. 1425 of the Civil Code of Québec, the reasons for decision were broadly expressed, stating generally applicable tax law principles that militate against retroactive amendment of agreements when unforeseen tax consequences result:

 

     First, accepting PJC Canada’s position would require this Court to ignore the legal relationships that it and PJC USA originally agreed to create, and actually created, in favour of the tax consequences they sought to achieve. It would thus undermine one of the fundamental principles of our tax system: that tax consequences flow from the legal relationships or transactions established by taxpayers. . . . For instance, in Shell Canada, this Court unanimously stated the following, at para. 45:

 

Unless the Act provides otherwise, a taxpayer is entitled to be taxed based on what it actually did, not based on what it could have done, and certainly not based on what a less sophisticated taxpayer might have done. [Emphasis in Wagner J.’s reasons.]

 

Equally, if taxpayers agree to and execute an agreement that produce unintended tax consequences, they must still be taxed on the basis of that agreement and not on the basis of what they “could have done” to achieve their intended tax consequences, had they been better informed. Tax consequences do not flow from contracting parties’ motivations or tax objectives.

 

     Second, I believe that allowing the amendment of the written documents in the instant appeal would amount to retroactive tax planning. [Emphasis added; paras. 41-42.]

[16]                        From Fairmont Hotels and Jean Coutu, taken together, I draw the following interrelated principles relevant to deciding this appeal:

(a)      Tax consequences do not flow from contracting parties’ motivations or objectives. Rather, they flow from the freely chosen legal relationships, as established by their transactions (Jean Coutu, at para. 41; Fairmont Hotels, at para. 24).

(b)      While a taxpayer should not be denied a sought‑after fiscal objective which they should achieve on the ordinary operation of a tax statute, this proposition also cuts the other way: taxpayers should not be judicially accorded a benefit denied by that same ordinary statutory operation, based solely on what they would have done had they known better (Fairmont Hotels, at para. 23, citing Shell Canada, at para. 45; Jean Coutu, at para. 41).

(c)      The proper inquiry is no more into the “windfall” for the public treasury when a taxpayer loses a benefit than it is into the “windfall” for a taxpayer when it secures a benefit. The inquiry, rather, is into what the taxpayer agreed to do (Fairmont Hotels, at para. 24).

(d)      A court may not modify an instrument merely because a party discovered that its operation generates an adverse and unplanned tax liability (Fairmont Hotels, at para. 3; Jean Coutu, at para. 41).

[17]                        At issue here is whether these principles are of general application, or whether they are confined to denying pleas of rectification. While the Court of Appeal confined them to cases where rectification was sought, appellate judgments in Ontario and Alberta have viewed them as more broadly applicable.

[18]                        In Canada Life, the respondent Canada Life and its affiliates undertook a series of transactions to realize a tax loss, so as to offset unrealized foreign exchange gains accrued in the same year. The CRA disallowed the claimed loss, and Canada Life sought rectification (or, in the alternative, an exercise of “inherent jurisdiction to relieve parties retroactively from the effects of their mistakes”) to undo the transactions (para. 16). The application judge granted rectification. On appeal, the parties agreed that the order could not stand following the decision in Fairmont Hotels, which was released after the application judge’s ruling. Canada Life cross‑appealed to seek rescission, relying on Pitt v. Holt and Re Pallen Trust as “authority that the remedy of equitable rescission of voluntary dispositions is available, even when the objective is to avoid unintended adverse tax consequences” (para. 36).

[19]                        “What [Canada Life] is seeking”, said the Court of Appeal in allowing the appeal and dismissing the cross‑appeal, “is the same type of intervention, by a different name, that the Supreme Court considered in Fairmont Hotels and Jean Coutu” (para. 43), and rejected (para. 7). Fairmont Hotels, it said, “was concerned not only with the availability of rectification”, but with “impermissible retroactive tax planning” (para. 67) in the form of a “‘rewriting of history’ . . . to correct an error leading to an unforeseen tax liability” (para. 75). Nothing, therefore, turns on whether the relief sought involved the alteration of the agreements themselves, or to undo a “‘mistake’ . . . in the structure of the transaction” (Canada Life, at paras. 74‑75).

[20]                        Canada Life relied upon two appellate judgments in support, the first being that of the Court of Appeal of Alberta in Harvest Operations Corp. v. Attorney General of Canada, 2017 ABCA 393, 61 Alta. L.R. (6th) 1 (paras. 80‑82). There, the Court of Appeal, citing Fairmont Hotels, first affirmed the application judge’s decision to deny rectification of documents recording share acquisition and reorganization transactions that had led to an unanticipated tax liability. The appellant had also pleaded in the alternative that “superior courts have equitable jurisdiction to relieve persons from the effect of their mistakes” (para. 73). This the Court of Appeal rejected as also having been caught by the precedent of Fairmont Hotels (paras. 74‑75).

[21]                        Canada Life also relied on 771225 Ontario Inc. v. Bramco Holdings Co. (1995), 1995 CanLII 745 (ON CA), 21 O.R. (3d) 739, where the Ontario Court of Appeal had declined to relieve a taxpayer of a mistake that left her company liable for a land transfer tax, saying: “. . . courts do not look with favour upon attempts to rewrite history in order to obtain more favourable tax treatment” (p. 742). This conclusion flowed from the principle that tax liability is based on what was actually agreed upon and done, not on what, in retrospect, a taxpayer should have done or wished it had done.

[22]                        I agree with the conclusion in Canada Life that Fairmont Hotels and Jean Coutu bar a taxpayer from resorting to equity in order to undo or alter or in any way modify a concluded transaction or its documentation to avoid a tax liability arising from the ordinary operation of a tax statute. The statements of principle in those judgments ⸺ that tax consequences flow from legal relationships, that taxpayers’ liabilities should be governed by the ordinary operation of tax statutes and on what the taxpayer agreed to do, and that legal instruments cannot be modified merely because they generated an adverse tax liability ⸺ are categorical, and not restricted to cases where rectification is sought. To be clear: they are of general application, precluding equitable relief altogether when sought to avoid an unintended tax liability that has arisen by the ordinary application of tax statutes to freely agreed upon transactions. There is no room for distinguishing Fairmont Hotels or Jean Coutu based upon the particular remedy sought. While a court may exercise its equitable jurisdiction to grant relief against mistakes in appropriate cases, it simply cannot do so to achieve the objective of avoiding an unintended tax liability.

[23]                        The foregoing ⸺ and, in particular, the statement that legal instruments cannot be undone or otherwise modified to avoid a tax liability arising from the ordinary operation of a tax statute ⸺ answers my colleague Côté J.’s objection at paras. 35-39 of her reasons. She says that Fairmont Hotels’ endorsement of the result in Re Slocock’s Will Trusts, [1979] 1 All E.R. 358 (Ch. D.), “generally [confirms] the availability of equitable remedies in a tax context” (para. 39). As this Court explained in Fairmont Hotels, however, rectification in Re Slocock’s Will Trusts was granted not to avoid a tax liability, but because “the deed as recorded . . . fail[ed] to record fully the terms of the parties’ original agreement” (para. 21). As a result, the plaintiff in Re Slocock’s Will Trusts was taxed on the basis of what she had freely agreed to do ⸺ the selfsame basis on which I say the respondents ought also to be taxed.

B.            Pitt v. Holt

[24]                        From the foregoing, it follows that the Court of Appeal erred in relying upon the conclusion in Pitt v. Holt that equity can relieve a tax mistake. That contradicts the principles outlined above, by maintaining that tax consequences are relevant to deciding whether a party to a voluntary disposition can satisfy the test for rescission ⸺ which in turn requires “a causative mistake of sufficient gravity . . . either as to the legal character or nature of a transaction, or as to some matter of fact or law which is basic to the transaction” (para. 122; see also para. 132). This divergence is unsurprising, given that English law lacks the prohibition against retroactive tax planning stated in Fairmont Hotels and Jean Coutu, and operates under a different legislative framework.

[25]                        Nor does Pitt v. Holt’s conclusion on this point account for our law that, in this case, required the Minister of National Revenue to apply the Act to the transactions. By s. 220(1) of the Act, Parliament has imposed upon the Minister a duty (“[t]he Minister shall”) to “administer and enforce” the Act. No discretion is afforded the Minister or the Minister’s agents: “They are required to follow [the Act] absolutely, just as taxpayers are also required to obey it as it stands” (Harris v. Canada (C.A.), 2000 CanLII 15738 (FCA), [2000] 4 F.C. 37 (C.A.), at para. 36, citing Ludmer v. Canada, 1994 CanLII 3547 (FCA), [1995] 2 F.C. 3 (C.A.); see also Longley v. Minister of National Revenue (1992), 1992 CanLII 5961 (BC CA), 66 B.C.L.R. (2d) 238 (C.A.), at para. 19). Quite apart from undermining Parliament’s direction, inconsistent exercises of discretion by the Minister or the Minister’s agents create inequity among taxpayers (S. Templeton, “A Defence of the Principled Approach to Tax Settlements” (2015), 38 Dal. L.J. 29, at p. 32). In a self‑assessing tax system such as that provided for in the Act, taxpayers should have confidence that the Minister is administering and enforcing the same tax laws in the same way for everyone (pp. 33-34 and 68).

[26]                        Practically, this constrains the Minister to assess a taxpayer in accordance with the facts of the matter ⸺ here, the transactions ⸺ and the law (CIBC World Markets Inc. v. Minister of National Revenue, 2012 FCA 3, 426 N.R. 182, at paras. 16 and 20‑21, per Stratas J.A.; Galway v. Minister of National Revenue, 1974 CanLII 2465 (FCA), [1974] 1 F.C. 600 (C.A.), at p. 602; Canada v. 984274 Alberta Inc., 2020 FCA 125, [2020] 4 F.C.R. 384, at para. 52). This goes to the respondents’ submission and my colleague’s conclusion that what brought this case into a “zone of unfairness” was the CRA changing its interpretation of the provisions and reassessing the respondents retroactively in light of the Tax Court’s decision in Sommerer (transcript, at p. 59; see also Re Pallen Trust, paras. 9 and 56; C.A. reasons, at para. 30; Côté J.’s reasons, at para. 80). My colleague impugns this as a “discretionary” measure on the CRA’s part, and finds “unfairness” in its decision to reassess the respondents in light of the Tax Court’s decision while simultaneously arguing at the Federal Court of Appeal that it was incorrectly decided. But, and respectfully said, this ignores that the Minister was bound to apply Parliament’s direction in the Act, as interpreted by a court of law, unless and until that interpretation is judged to be incorrect by a higher court. Unless a statute gives the Minister the power to deviate from that direction, the Minister may not deviate; nor may a court undermine that direction by resort to equity, since there is nothing unconscionable or unfair about the Minister administering the Act as Parliament directs. Equity is the conscience of the common law, not of Parliament.

[27]                        In short, the “unfairness” the respondents complain of was the direct result of the ordinary operation of the Act respecting transactions freely undertaken. And, as already discussed, no unfairness lies in holding the respondents to the consequent tax liabilities.

III.         Conclusion

[28]                        I would allow the appeal, with costs to the Attorney General in this Court and in the courts below. The judgments of the Court of Appeal and of the chambers judge should be set aside and the respondents’ petitions should be dismissed.

 

                  The following are the reasons delivered by

 

                    Côté J. —

I.               Overview

[29]                        I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of my colleague Justice Brown. I agree with him that both Canada (Attorney General) v. Fairmont Hotels Inc., 2016 SCC 56, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 720, and Jean Coutu Group (PJC) Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2016 SCC 55, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 670, affirm certain governing principles of tax law, such as the principle that taxpayers should be taxed based on what they did, not what they wish they had done, and the principle that retroactive tax planning is impermissible.

[30]                        However, I am unable to agree with my colleague that Fairmont and Jean Coutu are dispositive of the case at bar. Those cases are not determinative of the availability of rescission in the tax context. As I will explain below, rescission is, in strictly limited circumstances, an available remedy in Canadian law that can be used to unwind transactions that were undertaken on the basis of a mistaken assumption, even if permitting it would effectively relieve the taxpayer from payment of unexpected taxes.

II.            Analysis

[31]                        I will begin by discussing the governing principles that arise from Fairmont and Jean Coutu and will explain why, in my opinion, they do not preclude rescission in the tax context. These principles and the availability of the remedy of rescission can coexist. I will then consider the test for rescission and explain how the test developed in Pitt v. Holt, [2013] UKSC 26, [2013] 2 A.C. 108, ought to be applied in Canadian law. Finally, before applying the legal framework to the facts of this case, I will briefly comment on three topics that require clarification.

A.           In Canadian Tax Law, Fairmont and Jean Coutu Do Not Preclude Rescission for the Purpose of Unwinding Transactions That Have Been Entered Into Freely and Voluntarily

[32]                          In 2016, this Court rendered decisions in two companion tax law cases, Fairmont and Jean Coutu. My colleague writing for the majority in the case at bar agrees with the appellant that those cases preclude the availability of equitable remedies in the tax context and are as a result dispositive of this appeal. In my respectful view, neither Fairmont nor Jean Coutu precludes as a matter of principle the availability of an equitable remedy, be it rescission or rectification, in the tax context. Rather, those cases lay down principles of general application that are compatible with the availability of the remedy of rescission in the tax context.

[33]                        In Fairmont, this Court overruled the Ontario Court of Appeal’s decision in Canada (Attorney General) v. Juliar (2000), 2000 CanLII 16883 (ON CA), 50 O.R. (3d) 728, on the basis that it had erroneously “allowed for impermissible retroactive tax planning” (para. 24). In Juliar, the Court of Appeal had allowed parties to rectify an agreement freely entered into because it had produced unintended tax consequences (Fairmont, at para. 19); that result represented a departure from this Court’s jurisprudence and from the fundamental principles governing rectification.

[34]                        As was explained in Fairmont and Jean Coutu, a court cannot rectify an instrument merely because, in hindsight, the instrument is seen to have generated an adverse and unplanned tax liability. Rather, rectification is available only where: (i) there was a prior agreement whose terms are definite and ascertainable; (ii) the agreement was in effect at the time the instrument was executed; (iii) the instrument fails to accurately record the agreement; and (iv) the instrument, if rectified, would properly give effect to the parties’ prior agreement (Fairmont, at para. 38).

[35]                        The majority in Fairmont did not say, however, that equitable remedies — and rectification more specifically — can never be granted in a tax context. Instead, they simply clarified the test for rectification, emphasizing that it “is to be applied in a tax context just as it is in a non-tax context” (Fairmont, at para. 25). The decision did not preclude the application of equitable remedies in a tax context. As A. Swan, J. Adamski and A. Y. Na observe, “[t]he result of Fairmont Hotels is that the remedy of rectification has been returned or limited to its usual and proper scope” (Canadian Contract Law (4th ed. 2018), at §8.404).

[36]                        As for Jean Coutu, it too concerned the issue of rectification of documents that had resulted in unintended tax consequences, but under the Civil Code of Québec. In that case, Jean Coutu Group (PJC) Inc., relying on art. 1425 C.C.Q., sought to modify documents recording a series of corporate transactions, the purpose of which was one of tax neutrality. However, the scheme, as implemented, did not permit Jean Coutu to avoid tax liability. The majority refused to grant the rectification sought, explaining that to allow a general intention of tax neutrality to serve as a basis for retroactively modifying contracts would effectively amount to “a kind of catch‑all insurance for . . . inadvertence or mistakes . . . in planning transactions” (para. 42).

[37]                        With great respect, I am of the view that my colleague unduly expands the scope of those cases. Both of them stand for the well‑settled principle that taxpayers must be taxed based on what they agreed to do, not what they ought to have done. I agree with the Court of Appeal that the principles flowing from these decisions are not new, but

are consistent with the direction in Shell Canada, as well as earlier authorities such as Re Slocock’s Will Trusts, [1979] 1 All E.R. 358 (Eng. Ch. D.) . . . . These earlier authorities confirmed that the focus of the inquiry in a claim for rectification, applicable in both the tax and non-tax context, is whether the antecedent agreement or mechanism, in definite and ascertainable terms, was properly recorded.

 

(2020 BCCA 196, [2021] 1 C.T.C. 153, at para. 50)

[38]                        Lest there be any doubt, the majority in Fairmont actually affirmed that equitable remedies — even rectification — can be available in a tax context if the requisite equitable test is satisfied. They cited with approval, and relied upon, Re Slocock’s Will Trusts, commenting that the availability of rectification in that case had “simply confirmed that, provided that the underlying mechanism by which the parties had agreed to seek a particular tax outcome was omitted or incorrectly recorded, and provided that all other conditions for granting rectification are satisfied, a court retains discretion to grant rectification” (para. 21). Thus, a court may order rectification where the conditions for granting this remedy are met, even where rectification results in savings for the taxpayer. And that is in fact what had occurred in Re Slocock’s Will Trusts, which the majority in Fairmont approvingly described as “an unremarkable application of rectification to cure an omission in the instrument recording an antecedent agreement” (Fairmont, at para. 21).

[39]                        Thus, neither Fairmont nor Jean Coutu generally precludes the availability of equitable remedies in a tax context. Both of those decisions clarified the test for rectification. In Fairmont, the majority emphasized that “rectification is limited solely to cases where a written instrument has incorrectly recorded the parties’ antecedent agreement” (para. 13) and that, on the facts of that case, the party seeking rectification “could not show having reached a prior agreement with definite and ascertainable terms” (para. 39). Similarly, in Jean Coutu, which was rendered in the civil law context, the majority held that, under art. 1425 C.C.Q., a general intention of tax neutrality that is not related to obligations whose objects are determinate or determinable cannot on its own give rise to a common intention that would form part of the original contract and permit the requested modifications.

[40]                        Moreover, while both Fairmont and Jean Coutu clarified the circumstances in which the remedy of rectification is available, neither addressed specifically the availability of rescission. This is the consensus in the academic literature as well. For example, T. Fitzsimmons and E. S. Roth explain that

[t]he majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in Fairmont made no reference to rescission and did not determine (or even comment on) the circumstances in which the remedy of rescission can or should be granted. Although rectification and rescission share a doctrinal overlap and common evidentiary foundation, they are separate and distinct equitable remedies, and on the basis of the court’s reasons for judgment, it appears that the availability of the equitable remedy of rescission should therefore have been unaffected by the decision in Fairmont.

 

(“Rectification, Rescission, and Other Equitable Remedies After Fairmont Hotels Inc.”, in Canadian Tax Foundation, Report of Proceedings of the Sixty‑Ninth Tax Conference (2018), 30:1, at p. 30:34; see also T. J. Agioritis, “Is Rectification Still a Remedy? A Practical Overview”, in Canadian Tax Foundation, 2017 Prairie Provinces Tax Conference & Live Webcast (2017); R. Pandher and B. Graversen, “Does Fairmont Hotels Eliminate All Equitable Remedies in the Tax Context?” (2018), 66 Can. Tax J. 931, at p. 940.)

[41]                        Rescission and rectification ought not to be confused. As Pandher and Graversen write, “[t]he same brush cannot be used to paint all equitable remedies in the tax context” (p. 940). Rescission and rectification are two different remedies with different objectives. They “are not simply two roads leading to the same place” (R.F., at para. 40). Hence, depending on the nature of the case, one may justify a relief where the other cannot.

[42]                        Rectification requires a valid antecedent decision to carry out a particular transaction that was incorrectly transcribed on paper. The premise underlying this remedy is that it would be unfair to hold a person to be bound by a transaction they never agreed to (Swan, Adamski and Na, at §8.406). As for rescission, it relieves against a mistake. It presupposes that the transaction was transcribed correctly but was entered into under a mistaken assumption about the facts or the law. If granted, rescission “puts the parties in status quo ante and restores things, as between them, to the position in which they stood before the contract was entered into” (Guarantee Co. of North America v. Gordon Capital Corp., 1999 CanLII 664 (SCC), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 423, at para. 39 (emphasis added), quoting Abram Steamship Co. v. Westville Shipping Co., [1923] A.C. 773 (H.L.), at p. 781; see also Snell’s Equity (34th ed. 2020), by J. McGhee and S. Elliott, at para. 15‑001). In other words, the purpose of rectification is to ensure that a written instrument accurately reflects the parties’ antecedent agreement, whereas rescission enables a court to retroactively cancel a transaction that was entered into by mistake, thereby restoring the parties to their original position.

[43]                        In sum, Fairmont and Jean Coutu stand for the following propositions:

(a)     If a taxpayer does not meet the test for an equitable remedy, then a court has no discretion to grant that remedy, even if the taxpayer may have to pay taxes unexpectedly through no fault of its own (Fairmont, at paras. 13 and 39; Jean Coutu, at para. 23).

(b)     If the taxpayer meets the test for an equitable remedy, then the court may grant it, even if doing so would effectively relieve the taxpayer from payment of the unexpected taxes (Fairmont, at paras. 21‑22; Jean Coutu, at para. 24).

(c)     A common intention to limit or avoid tax liability is insufficiently precise to evince an existing prior agreement with definite and ascertainable terms (Fairmont, at paras. 39‑40; Jean Coutu, at paras. 23 and 50).

Contrary to my colleague’s conclusion, Fairmont and Jean Coutu cannot be read as precluding all equitable remedies from potentially applying in a tax law context.

B.            Rescission for Mistake in the Case of a Voluntary Disposition of Property

[44]                        The leading case on equitable rescission of unilateral transactions for mistake is Pitt v. Holt, a 2013 decision of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. My colleague asserts that the test for equitable rescission stated in Pitt v. Holt cannot be adopted in Canada, because its effect is that tax consequences are relevant to deciding whether a party to a voluntary disposition of property can satisfy the test for rescission (para. 24). I respectfully disagree.

[45]                        According to the propositions outlined above, if a taxpayer does not meet the test for an equitable remedy, then a court has no discretion to grant that remedy, even if the taxpayer may have to pay taxes unexpectedly, through no fault of its own. However, if the taxpayer meets the test for an equitable remedy, then the court may grant it, even if doing so would effectively relieve the taxpayer from payment of the unexpected taxes (R.F., at para. 8). Therefore, the test developed by Lord Walker in Pitt v. Holt is compatible with Canadian law and should be endorsed by this Court.

(1)         Test for Rescission for Mistake in the Case of a Voluntary Disposition of Property

[46]                        A court may rescind a voluntary disposition when there is “a clear causative mistake of sufficient gravity that demand[s] the intervention of equity” (A. H. Oosterhoff, “Causative Mistake of Sufficient Gravity, or Retroactive Tax Planning? A Comment on Re Pallen Trust” (2016), 35 E.T.P.J. 135, at p. 144). And “the test will normally be satisfied only when there is a mistake either as to the legal character or nature of a transaction, or as to some matter of fact or law which is basic to the transaction” (Pitt v. Holt, at para. 122).

[47]                        The test for rescission does not involve a strict set of rules. Rather, it is a fact-specific, objectively assessed “in‑the‑round” approach, as was explained in Pitt v. Holt:

The evaluation of what is or would be unconscionable must be objective. . . .

 

The gravity of the mistake must be assessed by a close examination of the facts, whether or not they are tested by cross-examination, including the circumstances of the mistake and its consequences for the person who made the vitiated disposition. Other findings of fact may also have to be made in relation to change of position or other matters relevant to the exercise of the court’s discretion. . . .

 

. . .

 

The injustice (or unfairness or unconscionableness) of leaving a mistaken disposition uncorrected must be evaluated objectively, but with an intense focus . . . on the facts of the particular case. . . .

 

. . .

 

. . . The court cannot decide the issue of what is unconscionable by an elaborate set of rules. It must consider in the round the existence of a distinct mistake (as compared with total ignorance or disappointed expectations), its degree of centrality to the transaction in question and the seriousness of its consequences, and make an evaluative judgment whether it would be unconscionable, or unjust, to leave the mistake uncorrected. The court may and must form a judgment about the justice of the case. [paras. 125‑126 and 128]

[48]                        Nevertheless, Lord Walker stated in Pitt v. Holt, and I agree, that “there are some types of mistake about tax which should not attract relief” (para. 132). Rescission on the ground of mistake should not be granted when the taxpayer has accepted the risk that the scheme might be ineffective, or when it would be against public policy to grant relief.

[49]                        I pause here to note that only a mistake can warrant rescission, as opposed to mere ignorance or “misprediction” (Pitt v. Holt, at para. 104). As Lord Walker explained, “[a] misprediction relates to some possible future event, whereas a legally significant mistake normally relates to some past or present matter of fact or law” (para. 109). In other words, a misprediction is a belief that later turns out to be wrong, whereas a mistake is a belief that is wrong at the time of the transaction (W. Seah, “Mispredictions, Mistakes and the Law of Unjust Enrichment” (2007), 15 R.L.R. 93, at p. 100). Similarly, a taxpayer’s ignorance or inadvertence cannot be characterized as a mistake, as that would be incompatible with the self-reporting and self-assessing nature of our tax system.

[50]                        Ultimately, equity will not intervene to relieve a taxpayer from the consequences of a risk that was knowingly or recklessly accepted. A taxpayer who is fully aware of potential tax issues associated with a transaction, or who proceeds with a tax plan in a reckless or ignorant manner, generally assumes the risk of being wrong and having to pay taxes.

[51]                        For example, in Neville v. National Foundation for Christian Leadership, 2013 BCSC 183, aff’d 2014 BCCA 38, 350 B.C.A.C. 7, Mr. Neville made a donation to a foundation on the understanding that the foundation “could” use all or part of the money to pay a scholarship to his daughter. Before he made the donation, the foundation had warned him that the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) might not accept the tax receipt as evidencing a valid gift and that the plan was “risky”. That case is a clear example of an accepted risk. Mr. Neville was aware of and assumed the risk that the CRA would disallow the tax credit he was claiming; there was no mistake, and rescission was unavailable to him.

[52]                        Additionally, a transaction that would have constituted abusive tax avoidance but for a mistake might be a consideration in the “in‑the‑round” analysis and preclude rescission. That would be an important element in the overall analysis, as it would highlight the risk the taxpayer has accepted and help to determine whether equity should intervene. When a tax plan is “aggressive”, the taxpayer is accepting the risk that the plan will not operate as intended. This weighs against the availability of rescission.

[53]                        However, the purported morality of a plan remains irrelevant. As this Court recently reiterated in Canada v. Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L., 2021 SCC 49, it is important to distinguish what is immoral from what is abusive: “Taxpayers are allowed to minimize their tax liability to the full extent of the law and to engage in ‘creative’ tax avoidance planning, insofar as it is not abusive within the meaning of the [general anti‑avoidance rule (“GAAR”)]” (para. 48). Therefore, rather than focusing on the purported morality of taxpayers arranging their affairs within the acceptable confines of the law, the focus should be on the risk the taxpayers accepted.

[54]                        It can be difficult to establish what constitutes an “aggressive” tax plan akin to abusive tax avoidance. Consequently, this concept should be strictly interpreted:

While a court may be reluctant to grant rescission to provide a taxpayer with relief from its own “aggressive” tax planning, that limitation should be narrowly interpreted. Courts may be expected to recognize the longstanding principle that taxpayers can structure their affairs to mitigate their tax burden, but structuring that goes beyond the pale may be subject to GAAR. . . . There will often be some level of uncertainty around tax‑structuring outcomes, and it would not be reasonable for a judge to conjure a notional spectrum of inappropriate but legal behaviours against which to gauge whether to grant equitable relief, unless the transaction was attacked with GAAR as the primary assessing position.

 

(J. Sorensen and A. Yuk, “Equitable Rescission for Tax Mistakes: It’s Not Over (Until it’s Over)” (2020), 68 Can. Tax J. 1149, at p. 1156)

[55]                        In sum, for rescission to be granted, the mistake needs to be sufficiently serious. Rescission will be available whenever failure to grant it would result in unfairness or in an injustice (P. S. Davies and S. Douglas, “Tax Mistakes Post‑Pitt v Holt” (2018), 32 T.L.I. 3).

[56]                        In accordance with this Court’s approach in Fairmont and Jean Coutu, rescission on the ground of mistake is an available remedy in a tax context just as it is in a non-tax context. That being said, rescission based on a mistake that relates solely to the tax consequences of a transaction should be granted only in rare circumstances. This is so because, as LeBel J. stated in Quebec (Agence du revenu) v. Services Environnementaux AES inc., 2013 SCC 65, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 838, “[t]axpayers should not view this recognition . . . as an invitation to engage in bold tax planning on the assumption that it will always be possible for them to [rescind] their [transactions] retroactively should that planning fail” (para. 54; Fairmont, at para. 82; Jean Coutu, at para. 21).

[57]                        Similarly, in Shell Canada Ltd. v. Canada, 1999 CanLII 647 (SCC), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 622, at para. 45, this Court stressed that a taxpayer should expect to be taxed “based on what it actually did, not based on what it could have done”. As the majority of the Court explained in Fairmont, just as taxpayers should not be denied a benefit because others have not availed themselves of the same benefit, “taxpayers should not be judicially accorded a benefit based solely on what they would have done had they known better” (para. 23). While this principle does not preclude the availability of recession in a tax context, Shell likewise underscores the fact that rescission is a remedy that may be granted only in rare circumstances where required by equity.

(2)         Alternative Remedies

[58]                        Finally, rescission is a remedy of “last resort”: even if a party meets the test for rescission, it can be granted only if no alternative remedies are available.

[59]                        There are two competing approaches to the assessment of the availability of alternative remedies. In Canada Life Insurance Co. of Canada v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 ONCA 562, 141 O.R. (3d) 321, the Ontario Court of Appeal held that the mere existence of a legal remedy warrants denying equitable relief. The court framed the question not as whether an alternative remedy would be successful, but solely whether there exists a remedy at law. The opposite view was expressed by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in 5551928 Manitoba Ltd. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 BCCA 376, 439 D.L.R. (4th) 483: it held that, when a court must determine whether an equitable remedy should be granted, it is not sufficient for an alternative remedy to merely exist. The court must, in exercising its discretion, ask whether the alternative remedy is practical or adequate.

[60]                        The second approach should be endorsed. The mere theoretical possibility of an alternative remedy where there is no evidence on how the remedy might apply in practice is insufficient to displace the court’s equitable jurisdiction to grant rescission. The alternative remedy must be sufficient to replace the relief being sought. In 5551928 Manitoba Ltd., a case concerning rectification, Newbury J.A. rightfully quoted a comment from Snell’s Equity that “rectification will not be decreed if the desired result can conveniently be achieved by other means” (paras. 40‑41 (emphasis in original), quoting Snell’s Equity (31st ed. 2005), at para. 43‑04). She went on to “doubt that Equity would force upon a party . . . an ‘alternative’ that is neither practical nor certain” (para. 41).

C.            Further Remarks

[61]                        Before applying the test for rescission to the facts of this case, I wish to discuss three matters that arise in this appeal.

(1)         Standard of Review

[62]                        Rescission is an equitable remedy that can be granted on a discretionary basis. It is trite law that deference is generally owed to discretionary decisions. Absent palpable and overriding error, deference is owed to findings of fact. Absent an error of law, erroneous principles or irrelevant considerations, deference is owed to a trial judge’s exercise of discretion (Wilson v. Alharayeri, 2017 SCC 39, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 1037, at para. 59). Thus, if the trial judge “has given sufficient weight to all relevant considerations and the exercise of discretion is not based on an erroneous principle, appellate reviewers must generally defer” (Canada (Attorney General) v. Fontaine, 2017 SCC 47, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 205, at para. 36). If there is no such error, appellate intervention is only warranted if the decision is manifestly unjust.

(2)         Sommerer v. The Queen

[63]                        In 2012, the Federal Court of Appeal affirmed the Tax Court of Canada’s decision in Sommerer v. The Queen, 2011 TCC 212, 2011 D.T.C. 1162, in which that court had narrowly interpreted s. 75(2) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (“ITA”) (Sommerer v. Canada, 2012 FCA 207, [2014] 1 F.C.R. 379).

[64]                        Section 75(2) of the ITA reads as follows:

75 (2) If a trust, that is resident in Canada and that was created in any manner whatever since 1934, holds property on condition

 

(a) that it or property substituted therefor may

 

(i) revert to the person from whom the property or property for which it was substituted was directly or indirectly received (in this subsection referred to as “the person”), or

 

(ii) pass to persons to be determined by the person at a time subsequent to the creation of the trust, or

 

(b) that, during the existence of the person, the property shall not be disposed of except with the person’s consent or in accordance with the person’s direction,

 

any income or loss from the property or from property substituted for the property, and any taxable capital gain or allowable capital loss from the disposition of the property or of property substituted for the property, shall, during the existence of the person while the person is resident in Canada, be deemed to be income or a loss, as the case may be, or a taxable capital gain or allowable capital loss, as the case may be, of the person.

 

[65]                        Before Sommerer, there was a general understanding in the tax community, which the CRA shared, that s. 75(2) would apply to a sale of shares as well as to a gift of shares. In the proceedings in Sommerer, the CRA, relying on its Interpretation Bulletin IT‑369R(SR), “Attribution of Trust Income to Settlor” (June 24, 1994), argued that s. 75(2) applied both to shares sold and to shares gifted: a person other than the settlor could transfer property to a trust and become subject to the attribution rules. The CRA advanced this position in its submissions to both the Tax Court and the Federal Court of Appeal. In the Tax Court, Miller J. held that the CRA’s interpretation was wrong. He concluded that the “person” referred to in s. 75(2) had to be the settlor of the trust. Therefore, a person other than a settlor could not transfer property to a trust and become subject to the attribution rules of s. 75(2). The CRA appealed the Tax Court’s decision and maintained its position in the Federal Court of Appeal, arguing that the trial judge had erred in his interpretation of s. 75(2), because a textual, contextual, and purposive interpretation of the provision supported the position that it applied both to shares sold and to shares gifted.

[66]                        However, the Federal Court of Appeal upheld Miller J.’s decision, holding that the “person” as defined in s. 75(2)(a)(i) of the ITA must be the settlor of the trust, and that the attribution rules therefore did not apply where the property in question was sold to a trust, as opposed to gifted to, or settled on, the trust. The court disagreed with the CRA’s long‑standing view that a person other than the settlor may transfer property to a trust and become subject to the attribution rules of s. 75(2).

(3)         Re Pallen Trust

[67]                        In 2015, the British Columbia Court of Appeal rendered its decision in Re Pallen Trust, 2015 BCCA 222, 385 D.L.R. (4th) 499. The facts in Pallen and in the case at bar are nearly identical. Indeed, as the British Columbia Supreme Court noted in its reasons in the instant case, “except for the names, the sections of the [reorganization] plan quoted in the chambers and Court of Appeal judgments in Pallen are identical to the  . . proposals for Collins and Cochran Family Trusts” (2019 BCSC 1030, [2020] 1 C.T.C. 26, at para. 38).

[68]                        In Pallen, the Court of Appeal considered precedents — such as 771225 Ontario Inc. v. Bramco Holdings Co. (1995), 1995 CanLII 745 (ON CA), 21 O.R. (3d) 739, to which my colleague refers — that reflect a public policy view that “taxpayers should not be encouraged to engage in aggressive tax planning and, when it proves to be unsuccessful, invoke the ‘mistake’ route to equitable rescission” (Pallen, at para. 52). Rescission was nonetheless granted on the basis of the specific facts of the case.

[69]                        In light of the reasons set out above, one fact stands: Fairmont and Jean Coutu did not cause the result in Pallen to be wrong. Not only do I agree with the Court of Appeal’s conclusion in the case at bar that Pallen remained good law in British Columbia following Fairmont and Jean Coutu, but I also conclude that Pallen was rightfully decided. Rescission “will be available if all the conditions for granting [it] are met, even if a tax advantage is achieved” (C.A. reasons, at para. 55). I will discuss Pallen in more detail in the application of the law to the facts, to which I now turn.

III.         Application

[70]                        As I will explain, the chambers judge in this case did not err in granting rescission, and the Court of Appeal was right to uphold his decision. Indeed, I am of the view that there is no basis for an appellate court to intervene with the chambers judge’s exercise of discretion.

A.           The Respondents Made a Mistake, Not a Misprediction

[71]                        I explained above that rescission cures only a mistake of law, not mere ignorance or a misprediction. Thus, the first issue to be decided is whether the respondents made a mistake rather than a misprediction. If the interpretation of s. 75(2) in Sommerer were deemed to have changed the law, then the respondents’ belief would have amounted to a misprediction, as they would not have anticipated that the law might be changed by a future judicial decision. I conclude that the respondents’ erroneous belief about s. 75(2) of the ITA was a mistake of law, not a misprediction in relation to a change in the law.

[72]                        Given that s. 75(2) had never been analyzed by a court when the Tax Court of Canada released its decision in Sommerer, that decision did not change the law. It stated what the law had always been even though the law had been erroneously interpreted by the CRA and by tax professionals. Indeed, the CRA’s interpretation bulletins are not authoritative sources of law (Mattabi Mines Ltd. v. Ontario (Minister of Revenue), 1988 CanLII 58 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 175, at pp. 195‑97). The argument that Sommerer changed the law cannot therefore stand. The respondents’ belief that s. 75(2) applied was consistent with the CRA’s interpretation at the time of the transactions in 2008 and 2009. That belief turned out to be wrong, as is clear from the decision in Sommerer.

[73]                        As I explained in discussing Pitt v. Holt, rescission relieves only against mistakes concerning the situation that existed at the time of the transaction. Such a mistake is what happened in the present case. Rescission is therefore available to remedy the respondents’ mistake about the law. It must now be determined whether, based on the “in‑the‑round” approach, rescission should have been granted by the chambers judge.

B.            The Respondents Meet the Pitt v. Holt Test for Rescission

[74]                        Rescission requires an inquiry that is focused on the specific facts of the case in question. Every minor fact can make a difference, and the decision is highly discretionary. The chambers judge, relying on the reasons of Newbury J.A. in Pallen, applied the proper test and weighed all of the relevant factors.

[75]                        The chambers judge noted that, in Pallen, the facts the Court of Appeal had had before it when it upheld the order for rescission were substantially analogous to the facts of this case. In Pallen, the Court of Appeal had held that “the existence of [a] ‘common general understanding’ regarding the operation of s. 75(2)” took the case “into the zone of unfairness” (para. 56). In the present case, the chambers judge held that Pallen was analogous and binding, making the following findings of fact at para. 56:

a)     The purposes of the plans were substantially the same;

 

b)     The material steps in the various plans were virtually identical;

 

c)     The plans were devised by the same accounting firm within approximately ten months of each other;

 

d)     There was a risk of GAAR applying to all of the plans and the accounting firm MNP advised of this risk;

 

e)     All matters concern the 2008 tax year (although the matters [here] also concern the 2009 tax year);

 

f)     The tax environment was the same (i.e. there was a general understanding, including by CRA, that s. 75(2) of the ITA applied to a sale of shares to a trust at fair market value);

 

g)     The effectiveness of the plans depended on the application of s. 75(2) of the ITA to deem the dividend income as being received by the holding company;

 

h)     The Sommerer decision thwarted all of the plans;

 

i)      All of the trusts were re-assessed after the Sommerer decision and by the same auditor; and

 

j)      The reason for the reassessments was the Sommerer decision.

[76]                        In both Pallen and the case at bar, the lower courts reasoned that the injustice stemmed from the CRA’s change of position on the interpretation of s. 75(2) after Sommerer was released. I agree with their reasoning. As in Pallen, what takes this case into the zone of unfairness is the CRA’s retroactive application of s. 75(2). At the time of the transaction, the taxpayer’s understanding was that the attribution rules of s. 75(2) applied as long as the trust held the property. This view was shared by the CRA and by tax professionals.

[77]                        It was only after the Tax Court had rendered its decision in Sommerer in April 2011, but before the Federal Court of Appeal had upheld the decision, that the CRA first notified the respondents that their 2008 to 2010 tax returns were under review. And it was while arguing in the Federal Court of Appeal in Sommerer that the trial judge had erred in law that the CRA first proposed to reassess the trusts at issue here and to include the dividends as income. The CRA’s position was: first, the application of s. 75(2) did not preclude an equivalent inclusion of the dividends in the trusts’ income by operation of s. 12(1)(j); second, if the CRA’s position on s. 75(2) was wrong and the decision in Sommerer was upheld, then s. 75(2) would not apply; and third, in the alternative, the GAAR should apply (C.A. reasons, at para. 14; see also A.R., vol. I, at pp. 176‑77).

[78]                        In December 2012, after the Federal Court of Appeal had upheld the Tax Court’s decision in Sommerer, the CRA notified the respondents that, in light of that ruling, the dividends had to be included in their income. The CRA finalized its audit in January 2016 and issued notices of reassessment in March 2016.

[79]                        With respect, my colleague misapprehends what takes this case into the zone of unfairness. He explains that the Minister was bound to apply Parliament’s direction in the ITA as interpreted by a court of law (para. 26). As a result, it forecloses, he says, the respondents’ submissions on unfairness. While I agree that s. 220(1) of the ITA imposes upon the Minister a duty to “administer and enforce” the ITA, I cannot agree that that s. 220(1) of the ITA is dispositive of the issue of unfairness.

[80]                        In my view, what takes this case into the zone of unfairness is not the application of the law, but rather the CRA’s discretionary decision to reassess the taxpayers based on a retroactive approach to s. 75(2). Unfairness results when the CRA reverses a long‑standing interpretation and then seeks to reassess a taxpayer retroactively. To be clear, I wish to emphasize that, while arguing in the Federal Court of Appeal that the trial judge in Sommerer had erred in law in his interpretation of s. 75(2), the CRA was seeking to reassess the taxpayers in this case by applying the same legal interpretation it was simultaneously arguing to be incorrect. This unfairness allows equity to intervene.

(1)         Neither Policy Reasons Nor Assumption of Risk Bars Rescission in This Case

(a)           The Respondents’ Plan Was Not an Abusive Tax Avoidance Scheme

[81]                        The appellant submits that the chambers judge erred in exercising his discretion by failing to consider that the transactions at issue would have constituted abusive tax avoidance but for the mistake. The appellant relies on Fiducie Financière Satoma v. The Queen, 2018 FCA 74, 2018 D.T.C. 5052, in which the Federal Court of Appeal deemed a similar scheme to constitute abusive tax avoidance. In Satoma, the Federal Court of Appeal concluded that a scheme involving the combined use of ss. 75(2) and 112(1) of the ITA (as in the case at bar) constituted abusive tax avoidance under the GAAR. Under the scheme in question, money was gifted to a trust and used by the trust to purchase shares, and the related dividends were attributed to the donor corporation pursuant to s. 75(2). The donor corporation used the attributed funds to donate surplus capital to the dividend paying corporation, reported the dividend income, and claimed an intercorporate dividend deduction in the same amount under s. 112(1), so that no taxes were paid on the issued dividends. The scheme complied with the ITA because the shares were substituted property for the gifted property, but the Minister considered the result abusive. The plan had the dual purpose of (1) transferring funds held by the corporation to the trust to finance the operations of related companies and (2) shielding the funds in question from potential lawsuits directed against those related companies.

[82]                        My understanding is that the appellant is suggesting that the result reached in Satoma should also have been reached in this case. In other words, the scheme in the present case should have been found to constitute abusive tax avoidance, which would be a significant factor of the “in‑the‑round” test.

[83]                        Although there are some similarities between this case and Satoma, the courts below were right to distinguish that case. The chambers judge stated that there are two important distinctions between Satoma and the present case: (1) in Satoma, the taxpayer’s reassessments were based solely upon the GAAR; and (2) the purposes of the transactions are different. I find no error in this regard in the chambers judge’s reasons.

[84]                        In Satoma, the Associate Chief Justice of the Tax Court had found that the primary purpose of the transaction was to avoid payment of any tax (chambers judge’s reasons, at paras. 66 and 70). As well, the taxpayer had conceded that “a series of transactions was conducted for the purpose of obtaining a tax benefit” and that this therefore constituted “an avoidance transaction within the meaning of subsection 245(3) of the ITA” (Fiducie Financière Satoma v. The Queen, 2017 TCC 84, 2018 D.T.C. 1031, at para. 76). The respondents in the case at bar make no such concession. On the contrary, the chambers judge in this case concluded that the “evidence before [him] does not establish that the primary goal of the petitioners was to avoid payment of any tax. Rather, the evidence before [him] establishes that the purpose was to shield assets from creditors and to do so in a manner that did not attract tax liability, with both aspects having equal importance” (para. 71 (emphasis added)). This finding is unassailable, as it is based on the parties’ agreed statement of facts (A.R., vol. I, at p. 98).

[85]                        The appellant submits that the purpose of asset protection could have been attained solely by means of a holding company and that there was no need to create the trusts to protect assets, adding that, “[i]f the chambers judge had examined each transaction in the [p]lan in isolation, he would have found that the following transactions had only a tax avoidance purpose and no asset protection purpose” (A.F., at para. 121 (emphasis deleted)). However, “[t]he purpose of a transaction is relevant mainly to characterize it as either an avoidance transaction or a bona fide transaction and, specifically, to assess the abusive nature of the transaction” (Alta Energy Luxembourg, at para. 47). The chambers judge concluded that there was a bona fide purpose for undertaking each of the transactions, namely asset protection. This was part of the analysis of the facts and is owed great deference by an appellate court.

[86]                        As in Pallen, the facts of this case are unusual and, in my view, did not involve aggressive tax planning. Weighed against all other considerations, the reorganization plan was not “aggressive” at the time it was undertaken, because the CRA was unlikely to have contested the respondents’ position prior to the decision in Sommerer.

(b)         Assumption of Risks

[87]                        While it may be risky to base an entire tax scheme on a provision that has yet to be interpreted by the courts, the chambers judge held that the respondents had never assumed the risk of a “reversal” by the CRA of its interpretation of s. 75(2) (paras. 47‑48). Deference is owed to the chambers judge’s conclusion on this point.

[88]                        I agree with the appellant that taxpayers and their advisors bargain to allocate risks of mistake and errors. But I do not agree that a taxpayer who hires an advisor is clearly aware of the tax risk involved in a transaction and should accordingly bear all the consequences — however remote or unforeseeable — that ensue. That would put a careless taxpayer who did not retain professional advice in a better position than one who did. In Pitt v. Holt, Lord Walker expressed the contrary view that if a taxpayer undertakes a plan without tax advice then a court might find that the taxpayer assumed the risk of the plan being mistaken and, therefore, cannot argue mistake.

[89]                        The appellant also argues that the respondents assumed the risks by not asking for an advance tax ruling. In my view, the advance ruling is a red herring. The most likely reason that MNP LLP (“MNP”), the respondents’ advisor, did not apply for such a ruling is that the CRA’s position on s. 75(2) was more than clear. The CRA’s interpretation of s. 75(2) had been consistent and was undisputed. It is unnecessary to obtain an advance ruling when the purpose of the scheme depends “on a particular, and widely accepted, interpretation” (chambers judge’s reasons, at paras. 2, 46 and 55; Pallen, at para. 55). But even if the respondents had asked for an advance ruling, the CRA’s advance rulings do not constitute law and are not binding on the courts.

[90]                        In my opinion, the only risk the respondents assumed was that the GAAR could potentially apply. The risks communicated by MNP in the plan proposals read as follows:

This proposal is based upon our understanding and interpretation of the existing provisions of the ITA, the ITR [the Income Tax Regulations] and the current administrative practices of the CRA.

 

. . .

 

The opinions expressed herein represent our views as Chartered Accountants experienced in income tax matters. None of the opinions are or should be construed to be legal opinions.

 

It should be noted that no application has been made for an advance tax ruling with respect to this proposal nor is it intended that any application be made. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the tax (or valuation) considerations discussed herein will not differ from the interpretation of the CRA.

 

. . .

 

In preparing this proposal, we have, of course, proposed transactions which are designed to meet with your client’s planning objectives while, at the same time, minimizing the income and other tax implications associated with those objectives.

 

Effective for transactions entered into after September 12, 1988, a broad GAAR can be used to eliminate any form of tax advantage resulting from one transaction or a series of transactions . . .

 

. . .

 

Arguably, the transactions contained herein do not include an avoidance transaction since there are bona fide purposes for undertaking each transaction which is asset protection (other than to obtain the perceived tax benefit). As well, even if it is found that the primary purpose of one or more transactions was to obtain a tax benefit, the tax consequences associated with each of the transaction we have proposed are derived from specific sections in the ITA, which provide for those results. As such, you are entitled to take the position that the transactions, which we have proposed should not reasonably be considered to result directly or indirectly in a misuse or abuse of the ITA read as a whole. Notwithstanding the above, we wish to emphasize, however, that professional advice cannot remove all the risk inherent in this very subjective rule and we want to ensure you are aware of that risk before proceeding. [Text in brackets in original.]

 

(chambers judge’s reasons, at paras. 17‑18)

[91]                        MNP specified that the proposal was “based upon the current tax environment” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 124). Although it did say that there was some risk the GAAR might apply, it did not alert the respondents to any risk with respect to s. 75(2). This was because of the CRA’s long-standing and well-publicized interpretation of s. 75(2). The respondents were not told and did not assume any risk that that interpretation could be overturned and a new one applied retroactively.

[92]                        The chambers judge ultimately agreed with the chambers judge in Re Pallen Trust, 2014 BCSC 305, [2014] 4 C.T.C. 129, at para. 57, and relied on his conclusion:

A key determinant in this case is the common general understanding as to the operation of s. 75(2) by income tax professionals and CRA as well as my finding that CRA would not have sought to reassess the Trust prior to Sommerer. This aspect of the case in my view is what takes the case into the zone of unfairness. While there was an aspect of risk in the Plan, given the common understanding as to the operation of s. 75(2), I do not see the assumption of risk in this case as a sufficient factor to refuse the relief sought. Had the understanding been less certain, the assumption of risk taking would have negatively affected the question of fairness. [Emphasis added; para. 48.]

[93]                        I agree with the chambers judge. In my opinion, the respondents did not assume the risk that the CRA would retroactively apply a decision that deemed its interpretation bulletins wrong. In fact, as I explained above, the certainty of the understanding on s. 75(2) is precisely what brings this case into the zone of unfairness.

(2)         Alternative Remedies

[94]                        Lastly, there are no alternative remedies that would preclude rescission in this case. The appellant submits that there are two alternative remedies that could be used to address the adverse tax consequences resulting from the mistake: (1) applying to the Minister for a remission of tax under s. 23 of the Financial Administration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F‑11, and (2) taking legal action against the respondents’ professional advisor, MNP. However, the proposed alternative remedies are neither practical nor appropriate; both are highly unlikely to succeed. The appellant in fact concedes that this is so, noting that these alternative remedies are “unlikely to assist a taxpayer who makes a tax planning mistake like the mistake in this case” (A.F., at para. 134). Yet the appellant argues that this is irrelevant to the outcome of this appeal. I disagree.

[95]                        First, a remission order pursuant to s. 23 of the Financial Administration Act is an extraordinary remedy to be granted by the Governor in Council in rare circumstances on the recommendation of the appropriate Minister (Fink v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FCA 276, 2019 D.T.C. 5127, at para. 1). As well, “[t]he ability to apply for remission through an Order in Council is restrictive, uncertain, complex and slow” (5551928 Manitoba Ltd. (Re), 2018 BCSC 1482, [2018] 6 C.T.C. 186, at para. 47, aff’d 2019 BCCA 376, 439 D.L.R. (4th) 483, at para. 41).

[96]                        A taxpayer can mitigate their risk by asking for an advance tax ruling. In its Remission Guide, the CRA explains that incorrect advice on its part may support a positive recommendation for remission (CRA Remission Guide — A Guide for the Remission of Income Tax, GST/HST, Excise Tax, Excise Duties or FST under the Financial Administration Act, October 2014 (online); see Escape Trailer Industries Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 FCA 54, 86 Admin. L.R. (6th) 1, at paras. 3‑4; Meleca v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 FC 1159, 2021 D.T.C. 5012, at para. 26). Given that the respondents did not ask for an advance ruling and in light of the CRA’s position on the trusts, it is highly unlikely that the Minister would recommend a remission of tax. The chambers judge placed the onus on the appellant to establish that an application to the government for remission was a practical alternative, and this onus was not met (C.A. reasons, at para. 86).

[97]                        I find no error in the chambers judge’s reasoning that there was “no evidence whatsoever regarding the procedure or conditions applicable to such a remedy or of the position the CRA is likely to take if such remedy was pursued”, and that he was therefore “completely unable to determine if it is a realistic alternative remedy” (para. 105). Accordingly, the possibility of applying for a remission order under s. 23 does not preclude rescission.

[98]                        Second, a claim against MNP would not be an adequate remedy. In Jean Coutu, the majority of this Court explained that

when taxpayers agree to certain transactions and later claim that their advisors made mistakes by failing to properly advise them that the transactions they agreed to would produce unintended tax consequences, the appropriate avenue to recoup their ensuing losses is not through the retroactive amendment of their agreement. Rather, if the mistakes are of such a nature as to warrant it, taxpayers can bring a claim against their advisors, who generally have professional liability insurance, and try to prove that claim in the courts. [para. 43]

[99]                        MNP duly advised the respondents about their plan. As Fisher J.A. concluded, MNP’s advice was correct at the time it was given. It is thus unlikely that a negligence claim against MNP would have any chance of success. “While an adequate remedy does not mean that it would necessarily be successful, I would not see a claim against MNP on the particular facts here to be either practical or appropriate” (C.A. reasons, at para. 90).

IV.         Disposition

[100]                     For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

                    Appeal allowed with costs throughout.

I.               Overview

[1]                             Access to justice depends on the efficient and responsible use of court resources. Frivolous lawsuits, endless procedural delays, and unnecessary appeals increase the time and expense of litigation and waste these resources. To preserve meaningful access, courts must ensure that their resources remain available to the litigants who need them most — namely, those who advance meritorious and justiciable claims that warrant judicial attention.

[2]                             Public interest standing — an aspect of the law of standing — offers one route by which courts can promote access to justice and simultaneously ensure that judicial resources are put to good use (see, e.g., Canada (Attorney General) v. Downtown Eastside Sex Workers United Against Violence Society, 2012 SCC 45, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 524, at para. 23). Public interest standing allows individuals or organizations to bring cases of public interest before the courts even though they are not directly involved in the matter and even though their own rights are not infringed. It can therefore play a pivotal role in litigation concerning the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, where issues may have a broad effect on society as a whole as opposed to a narrow impact on a single individual.

[3]                             In this appeal, the Council of Canadians with Disabilities (“CCD”) seeks public interest standing to challenge the constitutionality of certain provisions of British Columbia’s mental health legislation. CCD originally filed its claim alongside two individual plaintiffs who were directly affected by the impugned provisions. The individual plaintiffs discontinued their claims, leaving CCD as the sole plaintiff. CCD sought public interest standing to continue the action on its own.

[4]                             The Attorney General of British Columbia (“AGBC”) applied for dismissal of CCD’s action on a summary trial. He argued that the lack of an individual plaintiff was fatal to CCD’s claim for public interest standing because, without such a plaintiff, CCD could not adduce a sufficient factual setting to resolve the constitutional issue. In response, CCD filed an affidavit in which it promised to adduce sufficient facts at trial. The Supreme Court of British Columbia granted the AGBC’s application, declined to grant CCD public interest standing, and dismissed CCD’s claim. The Court of Appeal allowed CCD’s appeal and remitted the matter to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for fresh consideration. The AGBC appeals that decision.

[5]                             For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal, but grant CCD public interest standing, with special costs in this Court and in the courts below.

II.            Facts

A.           Council of Canadians with Disabilities

[6]                             CCD is a national not-for-profit organization established “to ensure that the voices of persons with disabilities are heard and to advocate for Canadians with disabilities” (A.R., at p. 88). During the underlying proceedings, it had 17 national or provincial member organizations, which themselves boasted several hundred thousand members.

[7]                             CCD’s mandate is threefold: it promotes the equality, autonomy, and rights of people living with physical and mental disabilities in Canada. It advances this mandate through advocacy, policy development, and rights advancement work (including litigation) on behalf of people with disabilities.

B.            Underlying Action

[8]                             On September 12, 2016, CCD and two individual plaintiffs (Mary Louise MacLaren and D.C.) filed a notice of civil claim in which they challenged the constitutionality of British Columbia’s mental health legislation. In the notice of civil claim, they alleged that certain provisions in three interrelated statutes — s. 31(1) of the Mental Health Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 288, s. 2(b) and (c) of the Health Care (Consent) and Care Facility (Admission) Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 181, and s. 11(1)(b) and (c) of the Representation Agreement Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 405 — violate ss. 7 and 15(1) of the Charter. Together, these provisions permit physicians to administer psychiatric treatment to involuntary patients with mental disabilities without their consent and without the consent of a substitute or supportive decision-maker under certain circumstances.

[9]                             Ms. MacLaren and D.C. were involuntary patients affected by the impugned provisions. In the notice of civil claim, they alleged that they had suffered harm from forced psychiatric treatment, including psychotropic medication and electroconvulsive therapy.

C.            Withdrawal of the Individual Plaintiffs and Amended Notice of Civil Claim

[10]                        On October 25, 2017, Ms. MacLaren and D.C. discontinued their claims and withdrew from the litigation, leaving CCD as the sole remaining plaintiff. CCD filed an amended notice of civil claim shortly afterward. In the amended notice, it removed all factual allegations relating to Ms. MacLaren and D.C. and replaced them with similar allegations regarding the nature, administration, and impacts of forced psychiatric treatment on involuntary patients generally. It also added a section in which it pled that it should be granted public interest standing.

D.           Notice of Application to Dismiss Filed by Attorney General of British Columbia

[11]                        On January 31, 2018, the AGBC filed an amended response in which he claimed that CCD did not meet the test for public interest standing and could not pursue its Charter claims without an individual plaintiff. Approximately six months later, the AGBC filed a notice of application in which he sought an order dismissing CCD’s action on the basis that CCD lacked standing to continue the action.

[12]                        CCD responded by filing an affidavit by Melanie Benard, the Chair of CCD’s Mental Health Committee. Ms. Benard deposed that:

1.      throughout her career as a lawyer specializing in mental health law, she gained direct experience with people who have or have had mental health-related disabilities;

2.      CCD is an established advocate for the rights of people with disabilities, including mental disabilities, and has brought or intervened in over 35 court cases dealing with the rights of people with disabilities, including 24 cases at the Supreme Court of Canada;

3.      Charter litigation is complex, often protracted, and stressful, and it is not reasonable to expect individuals who have mental disabilities to bring and see through a constitutional challenge; and

4.      CCD “intends to lead evidence from both fact and expert witnesses, including from people with direct experience” of the impact of the impugned provisions (A.R., at p. 236).

[13]                        Ms. Benard was not cross-examined on her affidavit.

E.            Subsequent Class Action and Personal Injury Claim

[14]                        In October 2019 — after the Court of Appeal for British Columbia heard the appeal in the case at bar but before it rendered its decision — three private litigants commenced a class action under the Class Proceedings Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 50, in which they challenge the same statutory provisions at issue in this appeal.  Ms. MacLaren and another plaintiff brought a similar action for constitutional and personal injury relief, but later discontinued that claim.

[15]                        At present, the proposed class action has not yet been certified. The AGBC opposes certification; on October 30, 2020, he filed a response asserting that the action fails to meet the criteria for certification.

III.         Judgments of the Courts Below

A.           Supreme Court of British Columbia, 2018 BCSC 1753 (Hinkson C.J.)

[16]                        The chambers judge granted the AGBC’s summary trial application, denied CCD standing, and dismissed CCD’s claim. In his view, CCD failed to satisfy the three-part test for granting public interest standing set out by this Court in Downtown Eastside: (i) whether the claimant has advanced a serious justiciable issue, (ii) whether the claimant has a genuine interest in the issue and (iii) whether, in light of all the circumstances, the proposed suit is a reasonable and effective means of bringing the issue before the courts.

(1)         Serious Justiciable Issue

[17]                        The chambers judge determined that CCD failed to raise a justiciable issue because its claim lacked “the indispensable factual foundation that particularizes the claim and permits the enquiry and relief sought” (para. 38 (CanLII)). He remarked that the “fundamental difficulty” with CCD’s claim was “the lack of a particular factual context of an individual’s case” (para. 37).

(2)         Genuine Interest

[18]                        The chambers judge held that CCD’s interest “only weakly” met the “genuine interest” criterion, because CCD’s work was “more focussed on disability (particularly physical disability) and far less focussed on mental health” (paras. 44 and 53).

(3)         Reasonable and Effective Means

[19]                        The chambers judge determined that granting CCD public interest standing would not be a reasonable and effective means of bringing the issue before the courts. He agreed that CCD had the expertise and resources to advance the claim, but remained unpersuaded of its ability to satisfy the “reasonable and effective means” factor for several reasons:

1.      CCD’s undertaking to provide a robust record at trial failed to satisfy its onus to meet the test for public interest standing on summary trial, and the chambers judge doubted that CCD could put forward “a sufficiently concrete and well-developed factual setting” upon which to decide the question it had raised (para. 69);

2.      CCD failed to persuade the chambers judge that it could fairly represent the interests of everyone affected by the impugned provisions, let alone “all residents of British Columbia”, to whom it referred in its amended notice of civil claim (para. 76);

3.      CCD’s advocacy efforts over the last 40 years did not necessarily commend it as an advocate for those with mental health-related disabilities, given that its engagement in advocacy for mental health-related disabilities, as opposed to physical health-related disabilities, had been relatively limited; and

4.      the Benard affidavit did not explain why it was unrealistic to expect individual plaintiffs who have mental disabilities and who have experienced the impacts of the impugned legislation to bring and see through a challenge to that legislation.

[20]                        Cumulatively weighing the three factors, the chambers judge declined to exercise his discretion to grant public interest standing and dismissed CCD’s action.

B.            Court of Appeal for British Columbia, 2020 BCCA 241, 41 B.C.L.R. (6th) 47 (Frankel, Dickson and DeWitt-Van Oosten JJ.A.)

[21]                        The Court of Appeal for British Columbia allowed the appeal, set aside the order dismissing the action, and remitted the matter to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for fresh consideration.

(1)         Access to Justice and the Principle of Legality

[22]                        In its analysis, the Court of Appeal began by commenting on two principles that Downtown Eastside highlighted as important features of standing law: (i) the importance of courts upholding the legality principle — the idea that state action must conform to the Constitution and must not be immunized from judicial review — and (ii) the practical realities of providing access to justice for vulnerable and marginalized citizens who are broadly affected by legislation of questionable constitutional validity.

[23]                        In the Court of Appeal’s view, these principles “merit particular weight in the balancing exercise a judge must undertake when deciding whether to grant or refuse public interest standing” (para. 79). While other concerns “must also be accounted for”, legality and access to justice are “the key components of the flexible and purposive approach mandated in Downtown Eastside” (para. 79).

(2)         Serious Justiciable Issue

[24]                        The Court of Appeal held that the chambers judge had erred in requiring “a particular factual context of an individua[l] case” or an individual plaintiff for the serious justiciable issue factor (para. 114). It described CCD’s claim as a “comprehensive and systemic constitutional challenge to specific legislation that directly affects all members of a defined and identifiable group in a serious, specific and broadly-based manner regardless of the individual attributes or experiences of any particular member of the group” (para. 112). For this reason, the Court of Appeal concluded, it would be possible for CCD to establish its claim by adducing evidence from directly affected non-plaintiff and expert witnesses instead of from an individual co-plaintiff.

(3)         Reasonable and Effective Means

[25]                        Given its conclusion on the serious justiciable issue factor, the Court of Appeal did not review the other Downtown Eastside factors. It did note, however, that the chambers judge’s analysis on the third factor did not comport with the flexible, purposive approach to standing mandated in Downtown Eastside. Specifically, it disagreed with any suggestion on the chambers judge’s part that, “if possible, it is always preferable for a public interest organization to assist an individual party in the background rather than seek public interest standing” (C.A. reasons, at para. 115 (emphasis deleted)).

(4)         Prospect of Duplicative Proceeding

[26]                        The Court of Appeal also commented on the proposed class action. It acknowledged that the prospect of duplicative Charter challenges are relevant to — but not determinative of — applications for public interest standing. The Court of Appeal concluded that the Supreme Court of British Columbia was best placed to assess CCD’s application for public interest standing upon review of a revised record containing this new information.

IV.         Issues

[27]                        This appeal raises three issues:

1.      What role do the principles of access to justice and of legality play in the test for public interest standing, and do they merit “particular weight” in the balancing exercise a judge must undertake to grant public interest standing?

2.       Without an individual co-plaintiff, how can a litigant seeking public interest standing show that its claim will be presented in a “sufficiently concrete and well-developed factual setting”? If revisiting the issue of standing at a later stage of a proceeding is necessary to ensure this setting is present, under what conditions should parties be permitted to do so?

3.      Applying these principles, should CCD be granted public interest standing? 

V.           Analysis

A.           Legality and Access to Justice in the Law of Public Interest Standing

[28]                        The decision to grant or deny public interest standing is discretionary (Downtown Eastside, at para. 20). In exercising its discretion, a court must cumulatively assess and weigh three factors purposively and with regard to the circumstances. These factors are: (i) whether the case raises a serious justiciable issue, (ii) whether the party bringing the action has a genuine interest in the matter, and (iii) whether the proposed suit is a reasonable and effective means of bringing the case to court (para. 2).

[29]                        In Downtown Eastside, this Court explained that each factor is to be “weighed . . . in light of the underlying purposes of limiting standing and applied in a flexible and generous manner that best serves those underlying purposes” (para. 20). These purposes are threefold: (i) efficiently allocating scarce judicial resources and screening out “busybody” litigants; (ii) ensuring that courts have the benefit of the contending points of view of those most directly affected by the issues; and (iii) ensuring that courts play their proper role within our democratic system of government (para. 1).

[30]                        Courts must also consider the purposes that justify granting standing in their analyses (Downtown Eastside, at paras. 20, 23, 36, 39-43, 49-50 and 76). These purposes are twofold: (i) giving effect to the principle of legality and (ii) ensuring access to the courts, or more broadly, access to justice (paras. 20, 39-43 and 49). The goal, in every case, is to strike a meaningful balance between the purposes that favour granting standing and those that favour limiting it (para. 23).

[31]                        Downtown Eastside remains the governing authority. Courts should strive to balance all of the purposes in light of the circumstances and in the “wise application of judicial discretion” (para. 21). It follows that they should not, as a general rule, attach “particular weight” to any one purpose, including legality and access to justice. Legality and access to justice are important — indeed, they played a pivotal role in the development of public interest standing — but they are two of many concerns that inform the Downtown Eastside analysis.

[32]                        To demonstrate this, I will define legality and access to justice, review their role in the development of public interest standing, and situate them in the Downtown Eastside framework. I conclude that the Court of Appeal was wrong to attach “particular weight” to these principles in its analysis.

(1)         Defining the Legality Principle and Access to Justice

[33]                        The legality principle encompasses two ideas: (i) state action must conform to the law and (ii) there must be practical and effective ways to challenge the legality of state action (Downtown Eastside, at para. 31). Legality derives from the rule of law: “[i]f people cannot challenge government actions in court, individuals cannot hold the state to account — the government will be, or be seen to be, above the law” (Trial Lawyers Association of British Columbia v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 2014 SCC 59, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 31, at para. 40).

[34]                        Access to justice, like legality, is “fundamental to the rule of law” (Trial Lawyers, at para. 39). As Dickson C.J. put it, “[t]here cannot be a rule of law without access, otherwise the rule of law is replaced by a rule of men and women who decide who shall and who shall not have access to justice” (B.C.G.E.U. v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 1988 CanLII 3 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 214, at p. 230).

[35]                        Access to justice means many things, such as knowing one’s rights, and how our legal system works; being able to secure legal assistance and access legal remedies; and breaking down barriers that often prevent prospective litigants from ensuring that their legal rights are respected. For the purposes of this appeal, however, access to justice refers broadly to “access to courts” (see, e.g., G. J. Kennedy and L. Sossin, “Justiciability, Access to Justice and the Development of Constitutional Law in Canada” (2017), 45 Fed. L. Rev. 707, at p. 710).

[36]                        In Downtown Eastside, this Court recognized that access to justice is symbiotically linked to public interest standing: the judicial discretion to grant or deny standing plays a gatekeeping role that has a direct impact on access (para. 51). Public interest standing provides an avenue to litigate the legality of government action in spite of social, economic or psychological barriers to access which may preclude individuals from pursuing their legal rights.

(2)         Role of Legality and Access to Justice in Developing Public Interest Standing

[37]                          Legality and access to justice are woven throughout the history of public interest standing. In Thorson v. Attorney General of Canada, 1974 CanLII 6 (SCC), [1975] 1 S.C.R. 138, for example, the Court relied primarily on the principle of legality to recognize the judicial discretion to grant public interest standing (p. 163). In that case, the Court granted a litigant standing to challenge a law that did not directly affect him, reasoning that a constitutional question should not “be immunized from judicial review by denying standing to anyone to challenge the impugned statute” (p. 145).

[38]                        Legality was again at issue in Nova Scotia Board of Censors v. McNeil, 1975 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1976] 2 S.C.R. 265, a case in which the Court granted standing even though it would have been possible for someone more directly affected by the law to initiate private litigation. In that case, the Court permitted a newspaper editor — a member of the public — to challenge censorial powers granted to an administrative body. Theatre owners and operators were more directly affected by the legislation than the general public, but the Court reasoned that challenges from those individuals were unlikely. Since there was “no other way, practically speaking, to subject the challenged Act to judicial review,” the Court granted a member of the public standing to seek a declaration that the legislation was constitutionally invalid (p. 271).

[39]                        Access to justice featured alongside the principle of legality in Finlay v. Canada (Minister of Finance), 1986 CanLII 6 (SCC), [1986] 2 S.C.R. 607, this Court’s first post-Charter case on public interest standing. There, the Court granted standing and emphasized “the importance in a federal state that there be some access to the courts to challenge the constitutionality of legislation” (p. 627). It also observed that the rationale behind discretionary standing was the public interest in maintaining respect for “the limits of statutory authority” (pp. 631-32).

[40]                        Finally, in Canadian Council of Churches v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), 1992 CanLII 116 (SCC), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 236, this Court relied on legality to deny public interest standing. The Court underscored “the fundamental right of the public to government in accordance with the law” and acknowledged that the “whole purpose” of public interest standing is “to prevent the immunization of legislation or public acts from any challenge” (pp. 250 and 252). Because the measure had already been “subject to attack” by private litigants, granting public interest standing was “not required” (pp. 252-53). 

(3)         Current Framework Addresses Legality and Access to Justice

[41]                        The current framework for public interest standing stems from Downtown Eastside. Under this framework, courts flexibly and purposively weigh the three Downtown Eastside factors in light of the “particular circumstances” and in a “liberal and generous manner” (para. 2, citing Canadian Council of Churches, at p. 253).

[42]                          The Downtown Eastside framework addresses a number of concerns that underlie standing law. Legality and access to justice are two of these concerns. But the framework also accommodates traditional concerns related to the expansion of public interest standing, including allocating scarce judicial resources and screening out “busybodies”, ensuring that courts have the benefit of contending points of view of those most directly affected by the issues, and ensuring that courts play their proper role in our constitutional democracy. 

[43]                          It will be helpful to briefly trace each of these concerns, and their place in the Downtown Eastside framework. Legality and access to justice are primarily considered in relation to the third factor, but it is useful to review all three.

(a)           Traditional Concerns of Standing Law

[44]                        The need to carefully allocate scarce judicial resources relates to the effective operation of the justice system as a whole. As this Court held in Canadian Council of Churches, “[i]t would be disastrous if the courts were allowed to become hopelessly overburdened as a result of the unnecessary proliferation of marginal or redundant suits brought by well-meaning organizations pursuing their own particular cases” (p. 252). This concern also relates to a possible multiplicity of suits by “mere busybod[ies]”, that is, plaintiffs who seek to use the courts to advance personal agendas and who may undermine other challenges by plaintiffs with a real stake in a matter (Finlay, at p. 631).

[45]                        In Downtown Eastside, the Court noted that the concern about “busybodies” may be overstated: “[f]ew people, after all, bring cases to court in which they have no interest and which serve no proper purpose” (para. 28). The denial of standing “is not the only, or necessarily the most appropriate means of guarding against these dangers”: courts can also screen claims for merit at an early stage, can intervene to prevent abuse and have the power to award costs, all of which may avert a multiplicity of suits from “busybodies” (para. 28).

[46]                        Hearing contending points of view from those most affected by the issues enables the courts to do their job: courts “depend on the parties to present the evidence and relevant arguments fully and skillfully” (Downtown Eastside, at para. 29). Without specific facts and argument from affected parties, “both the Court’s ability to ensure that it hears from those most directly affected and that Charter issues are decided in a proper factual context are compromised” (Hy and Zel’s Inc. v. Ontario (Attorney General), 1993 CanLII 30 (SCC), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 675, at p. 694).

[47]                        In conformity with the proper role of the courts and with their constitutional relationship to the other branches of state, parties to litigation must raise a question that is appropriate for judicial determination — that is, a justiciable question. A court might not, for example, “have the legitimacy to assist in resolving a dispute about the greatest hockey player of all time, about a bridge player who is left out of his regular weekly game night, or about a cousin who thinks she should have been invited to a wedding” (Highwood Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses (Judicial Committee) v. Wall, 2018 SCC 26, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 750, at para. 35).

(b)         Serious Justiciable Issue

[48]                        The first of the Downtown Eastside factors, whether there is a serious justiciable issue, relates to two of the traditional concerns. Justiciability is linked to the concern about the proper role of the courts and their constitutional relationship to the other branches of state. By insisting on the existence of a justiciable issue, the courts ensure that the exercise of their discretion with respect to standing is consistent with their proper constitutional role. Seriousness, by contrast, addresses the concern about the allocation of scarce judicial resources and the need to screen out the “mere busybody”. This factor also broadly promotes access to justice by ensuring that judicial resources remain available to those who need them most (see, e.g., Trial Lawyers, at para. 47).

[49]                        A serious issue will arise when the question raised is “far from frivolous” (Downtown Eastside, at para. 42, citing Finlay, at p. 633). Courts should assess a claim in a “preliminary manner” to determine whether “some aspects of the statement of claim could be said to raise a serious issue as to the validity of the legislation” (Downtown Eastside, at para. 42, citing Canadian Council of Churches, at p. 254). Once it becomes clear that the statement of claim reveals at least one serious issue, it will usually be unnecessary to minutely examine every pleaded claim to assess standing (Downtown Eastside, at para. 42).

[50]                        To be justiciable, an issue must be one that is appropriate for a court to decide, that is, the court must have the institutional capacity and legitimacy to adjudicate the matter (Highwood Congregation, at paras. 32-34). Public interest standing hinges on the existence of a justiciable question (Downtown Eastside, at para. 30). Unless an issue is justiciable in the sense that it is suitable for judicial determination, it should not be heard and decided no matter who the parties are (Highwood Congregation, at para. 33, citing L. M. Sossin, Boundaries of Judicial Review: The Law of Justiciability in Canada (2nd ed. 2012), at p. 7).

(c)           Genuine Interest

[51]                        The second factor, being whether the plaintiff has a genuine interest in the issues, also reflects the concern for conserving scarce judicial resources and the need to screen out the mere busybody. This factor asks “whether the plaintiff has a real stake in the proceedings or is engaged with the issues they raise” (Downtown Eastside, at para. 43). To determine whether a genuine interest exists, a court may refer, among other things, to the plaintiff’s reputation and to whether the plaintiff has a continuing interest in and link to the claim (see, e.g., Canadian Council of Churches, at p. 254).

(d)         Reasonable and Effective Means

[52]                        The third factor, reasonable and effective means, implicates both legality and access to justice. It is “closely linked” to legality, since it involves asking whether granting standing is desirable to ensure lawful action by government actors (Downtown Eastside, at para. 49). It also requires courts to consider whether granting standing will promote access to justice “for disadvantaged persons in society whose legal rights are affected” by the challenged law or action (para. 51).

[53]                        This factor also relates to the concern about needlessly overburdening the justice system, because “[i]f there are other means to bring the matter before the court, scarce judicial resources may be put to better use” (Hy and Zel’s, at p. 692). And it addresses the concern that courts should have the benefit of contending views of the persons most directly affected by the issues (Finlay, at p. 633).

[54]                        To determine whether, in light of all the circumstances, a proposed suit is a reasonable and effective means of bringing an issue before the court, courts should consider whether the proposed action is an economical use of judicial resources, whether the issues are presented in a context suitable for judicial determination in an adversarial setting, and whether permitting the proposed action to go forward will serve the purpose of upholding the principle of legality (Downtown Eastside, at para. 50). Like the other factors, this one should be applied purposively, and from a “practical and pragmatic point of view” (para. 47).

[55]                        The following non-exhaustive list outlines certain “interrelated matters” a court may find useful when assessing the third factor (Downtown Eastside, at para. 51):

1.      The plaintiff’s capacity to bring the claim forward: What resources and expertise can the plaintiff provide? Will the issue be presented in a sufficiently concrete and well-developed factual setting?

2.      Whether the case is of public interest: Does the case transcend the interests of those most directly affected by the challenged law or action? Courts should take into account that one of the ideas animating public interest litigation is that it may provide access to justice for disadvantaged persons whose legal rights are affected.

3.      Whether there are alternative means: Are there realistic alternative means which would favour a more efficient and effective use of judicial resources and would present a context more suitable for adversarial determination? If there are other proceedings relating to the matter, what will be gained in practice by having parallel proceedings? Will the other proceedings resolve the issues in an equally or more effective and reasonable manner? Will the plaintiff bring a particularly useful or distinctive perspective to the resolution of those issues?

4.      The potential impact of the proceedings on others: What impact, if any, will the proceedings have on the rights of others who are equally or more directly affected? Could “the failure of a diffuse challenge” prejudice subsequent challenges by parties with specific and factually established complaints? (para. 51, citing Danson v. Ontario (Attorney General), 1990 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1086, at p. 1093).

(4)         Conclusion on Access to Justice and Legality in Public Interest Standing Law

[56]                        The Court of Appeal was wrong to conclude that the principles of legality and access to justice merit “particular weight” in the Downtown Eastside analysis. This Court’s case law, and in particular the existing Downtown Eastside framework, already addresses these factors in both implicit and explicit fashion. However, it does not assign them a place of principal importance in the analysis.

[57]                        Legality, for example, is taken into account in the context of the “reasonable and effective means” factor (Downtown Eastside, at para. 49), and may also be considered in relation to the “interrelated matters” that can assist a court in assessing that factor (para. 51). As for access to justice, it too is taken into consideration in assessing whether a suit is a reasonable and effective means of bringing an issue before the courts. And it is also accounted for in the context of the “serious justiciable issue” factor, which allows courts to screen out unmeritorious claims and ensure that judicial resources remain available to those who need them most.

[58]                        Because legality and access to justice feature most prominently in relation to the third factor, attaching “particular weight” to them would effectively transform the “reasonable and effective means” factor into a determinative one. This Court explicitly warned against such an outcome in Downtown Eastside. It encouraged courts to take access to justice and legality into account, but specified that “this should not be equated with a license to grant standing to whoever decides to set themselves up as the representative of the poor or marginalized” (para. 51).

[59]                        In Downtown Eastside, the Court endorsed a flexible, discretionary approach to public interest standing. This approach must be guided by all the underlying purposes of limiting standing, as well as by legality and access to justice. While access to justice and, in particular, legality were central to the development of the law of public interest standing, and while they are important considerations, they are not the only concerns to take into account. Put another way, no one purpose, principle or factor takes precedence in the analysis.

B.            Sufficient Factual Setting For Trial

[60]                          The third Downtown Eastside factor requires courts to consider whether, in all the circumstances, a proposed suit is a reasonable and effective means of bringing an issue before the courts. One of the many matters a court is to consider when assessing this factor is “the plaintiff’s capacity to bring forward [the] claim” (para. 51). To evaluate the plaintiff’s capacity to do so, the court “should examine, amongst other things, the plaintiff’s resources, expertise, and whether the issue will be presented in a sufficiently concrete and well-developed factual setting” (para. 51).

[61]                        The dispute in this appeal revolves around this last question: “. . . whether the issue will be presented in a sufficiently concrete and well-developed factual setting”. The AGBC argues that CCD did not — and cannot — adduce a sufficient factual setting because it lacks an individual co-plaintiff, and that standing should therefore be denied.

[62]                        The AGBC’s argument invites this Court to consider how public interest litigants can satisfy a court that a sufficient factual setting will exist at trial. Is an individual plaintiff necessary in circumstances like those on appeal? If not, how can a plaintiff satisfy the court that such a setting will be forthcoming where, as here, standing is challenged at a preliminary stage of litigation? And, if it becomes necessary to revisit the issue of standing to ensure that this factual setting exists, under what circumstances should a party be permitted to do so?

(1)         Individual Co-plaintiff Not Required

[63]                        At the outset, both parties rightly acknowledge that public interest litigation may proceed in some cases without a directly affected plaintiff (see, e.g., A.F., at para. 59). A statute’s very existence, for example, or the manner in which it was enacted can be challenged on the basis of legislative facts alone (see, e.g., Danson, at pp. 1100-1101).

[64]                        The AGBC, however, submits that where the impacts of legislation are at issue, evidence from a directly affected plaintiff is vital to “ensuring that a factual context suitable for judicial determination is present” before standing is granted (A.F., at para. 60). In such cases, the AGBC maintains, an applicant for public interest standing should be required to (i) explain the absence of an individual plaintiff, (ii) show how it is a suitable proxy for the rights and interests of directly affected plaintiffs, and (iii) demonstrate, “with some specificity”, how it will provide a well-developed factual context that compensates for the absence of a directly affected plaintiff (paras. 40 and 66).

[65]                        I would not impose such rigid requirements, for two reasons.

[66]                        First, a directly affected plaintiff is not vital to establish a “concrete and well-developed factual setting”. Public interest litigants can establish such a setting by calling affected (or otherwise knowledgeable) non-plaintiff witnesses (see, e.g., Carter v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 5, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 331, at paras. 14-16, 22 and 110; Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, 2013 SCC 72, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1101, at paras. 15 and 54; Downtown Eastside, at para. 74). As long as such a setting exists, a directly affected co-plaintiff or a suitable proxy is not required for a public interest litigant to be granted standing. If a directly affected co-plaintiff is not required, then would-be public interest litigants should not have to justify — or compensate for — the absence of one.

[67]                        Second, the AGBC’s proposed requirements would thwart many of the traditional purposes underlying standing law. A strict requirement for a directly affected co-plaintiff would pose obstacles to access to justice and would undermine the principle of legality. Constitutional litigation is already fraught with formidable obstacles for litigants. These proposed requirements would also raise unnecessary procedural hurdles that would needlessly deplete judicial resources. Given these concerns, the Court was correct in Downtown Eastside to retain the presence of directly affected litigants as a factor — rather than a separate legal and evidentiary hurdle — in the discretionary balancing, to be weighed on a case-by-case basis. I would not disturb that conclusion here.

(2)         Satisfying a Court on this Factor Will Be Context-Specific

[68]                        The question remains: In the absence of a directly affected co-plaintiff, how might a would-be public interest litigant demonstrate that the issues “will be presented in a sufficiently concrete and well-developed factual setting” (Downtown Eastside, at para. 51 (emphasis added))? And, in particular, how might such a litigant do so where (as here) standing is challenged at a preliminary stage of the litigation?

[69]                        To begin, a few clarifications are in order. As the Court explained in Downtown Eastside, none of the factors it identified are “hard and fast requirements” or “free-standing, independently operating tests” (Downtown Eastside, at para. 20). Rather, they are to be assessed and weighed cumulatively, in light of all the circumstances. It follows that, where standing is challenged at a preliminary stage, whether a “sufficiently concrete and well-developed factual setting” will exist at trial may not be dispositive. The trial judge retains the discretion to determine the significance of this consideration at a preliminary stage by taking the particular circumstances into account.

[70]                        That said, the absence of such a setting will in principle be dispositive at trial. A court cannot decide constitutional issues in a factual vacuum (Mackay v. Manitoba, 1989 CanLII 26 (SCC), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 357, at pp. 361-62). Evidence is key in constitutional litigation unless, in exceptional circumstances, a claim may be proven on the face of the legislation at issue as a question of law alone (see, e.g., Danson, at pp. 1100-1101, citing Manitoba (Attorney General) v. Metropolitan Stores Ltd., 1987 CanLII 79 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 110, at p. 133). Standing may therefore be revisited where it becomes apparent, after discoveries, that the plaintiff has not adduced sufficient facts to resolve the claim. As I will explain below, however, parties should consider other litigation management strategies before revisiting the issue of standing, given that such strategies may provide a more appropriate route to address the traditional concerns that underlie standing law (Downtown Eastside, at para. 64). For example, summary dismissal may be open to a defendant where there is no evidence to support an element of the claim (as in Hryniak v. Mauldin, 2014 SCC 7, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 87, at para. 93).

[71]                        With these clarifications in mind, I will now return to the question at hand: What suffices to show that a sufficiently concrete and well-developed factual setting will be forthcoming at trial? The answer to this question necessarily depends on the circumstances, including (i) the stage of litigation at which standing is challenged, and (ii) the nature of the case and the issues before the court. On the first point, what may, for example, satisfy the court at an early stage may not suffice at a later stage. Likewise, the significance of a lack of evidence will vary with the nature of the claim and the pleadings. Some cases may not be heavily dependent on individual facts — where, for example, the claim can be argued largely on the face of the legislation. In such cases, an absence of concrete evidence at the pleadings stage may not be fatal to a claim for standing. Where a case turns to a greater extent on individual facts, however, an evidentiary basis will weigh more heavily in the balance, even at a preliminary stage of the proceedings. 

[72]                        When standing is challenged at a preliminary stage, the plaintiff should not be required to provide trial evidence. That would be procedurally unfair, as it would permit the defendant to obtain evidence before discovery. Generally, however, a mere undertaking or intention to adduce evidence will not be enough to persuade a court that an evidentiary basis will be forthcoming. It may be helpful to give some examples of the considerations a court may find relevant when assessing whether a sufficiently concrete and well-developed factual setting will be produced at trial. As was the case in Downtown Eastside, for the purposes of its assessment of the “reasonable and effective means” factor, this list is not exhaustive, but illustrative.

1.      Stage of the proceedings: The court should take account of the stage of the proceedings at which standing is challenged. At a preliminary stage, a concrete factual basis may not be pivotal in the Downtown Eastside framework — the specific weight to be attached to this consideration will depend on the circumstances, and ultimately lies within the trial judge’s discretion. At trial, however, the absence of a factual basis should generally preclude a grant of public interest standing.

2.      Pleadings: The court should consider the nature of the pleadings and what material facts are pled. Are there concrete facts with respect to how legislation has been applied that can be proven at trial? Or are there merely hypothetical facts with respect to how legislation might be interpreted or applied? Do the pleadings reveal that the case can be argued largely on the face of the legislation, such that individual facts may not be pivotal? Or does the case turn more heavily on individualized facts?

3.      The nature of the public interest litigant: The court may also consider whether the litigant — if it is an organization — is composed of or works directly with individuals who are affected by the impugned legislation. If that is the case, it would be reasonable to infer that the litigant has the capacity to produce evidence from directly affected individuals.

4.      Undertakings: Courts rigorously enforce undertakings, which must be “strictly and scrupulously carried out” (see, e.g., Law Society of British Columbia, Code of Professional Conduct for British Columbia (online), rule 5.1-6). An undertaking by a lawyer to provide evidence might help to persuade a court that a sufficient factual setting will exist at trial, but an undertaking alone will seldom suffice.

5.      Actual evidence: Though a party is not required to do so, providing actual evidence — or a list of potential witnesses and the evidence they will provide — is a clear and compelling way to respond to a challenge to standing at a preliminary stage. As I explained above, the significance of a lack of evidence will depend on the stage of the litigation, the nature and context of the case, and the pleadings.

(3)         Ability to Revisit Standing

[73]                        In Downtown Eastside, this Court cautioned against using the “blunt instrument of a denial of standing” where other well-established litigation management strategies could ensure the efficient and effective use of judicial resources (para. 64). For example, courts can screen claims for merit at an early stage by intervening to prevent abuse, and have the power to award costs. A court hearing a preliminary challenge to standing may also defer consideration of the issue to trial (Finlay, at pp. 616-17). Any of these tools may provide a more appropriate route to address the traditional concerns that underlie standing law, and courts should take these tools into account when exercising their discretion to grant or deny standing (Downtown Eastside, at para. 64). Likewise, parties should generally pursue alternative litigation management strategies first, before seeking to revisit the issue of standing.

[74]                        Courts, however, retain the ability to reconsider standing, even where it was initially granted at a preliminary stage (Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General), 1989 CanLII 123 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342). The ability to revisit standing depends on a plaintiff’s continued efforts to demonstrate that a sufficiently concrete and well-developed factual setting will be put forward at trial. In this sense, the ability to revisit standing acts as a fail-safe to ensure that the plaintiff does not rest on its laurels.

[75]                        To be clear, the courts’ ability to revisit standing is not an open invitation to defendants to challenge standing at every available opportunity. Litigants must not waste judicial resources or unduly hinder the litigation process. For that reason, a defendant wishing to revisit standing may apply to do so only if a material change has occurred that raises a serious doubt that the public interest litigant will be able to put forward a sufficiently concrete and well-developed factual setting, and alternative litigation management strategies are inadequate to address the deficiency. One example of such a material change would be where the plaintiff undertook to provide evidence in response to a previous challenge to standing but failed to do so. By contrast, moving from one stage of the litigation to another does not, by itself, correspond to a material change that would merit revisiting standing.

[76]                        A material change that raises a serious doubt that a plaintiff will be able to put forward a sufficiently concrete and well-developed factual setting is most likely to occur when the parties exchange pleadings or complete the discovery stage. These are the steps in the litigation process at which the factual setting is most likely to emerge. Unsurprisingly, the importance of the factual setting increases at each step of the process as the litigation progresses. This means that a plaintiff’s inability to demonstrate that it will put forward a sufficiently concrete and well-developed factual setting will carry more weight at the close of the discovery stage than after the exchange of pleadings, at which point the absence of concrete evidence would be less significant. Like the initial decision on standing, a decision to revisit standing turns on the particular circumstances of the case (Downtown Eastside, at para. 2).

[77]                        While I do not foreclose the possibility of a material change occurring other than at the pleadings and discovery stages, such an occurrence would be rare. One example of an appropriate case would be where the original basis for the plaintiff’s standing has been called into question or becomes moot. The latter situation arose in the Borowski saga. In 1981, this Court granted Mr. Borowski public interest standing to challenge the prohibition against abortion in the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (see Minister of Justice of Canada v. Borowski, 1981 CanLII 34 (SCC), [1981] 2 S.C.R. 575), but the impugned provisions were subsequently struck down in R. v. Morgentaler, 1988 CanLII 90 (SCC), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 30. In 1989, this Court held that Mr. Borowski lacked standing to continue the case, because he was now asking the court to address a “purely abstract question” about the rights of a foetus, which meant that his challenge now amounted to a “private reference” (Borowski (1989), at pp. 365-68).

C.            Application to the Facts

[78]                        At the oral hearing, CCD requested leave to cross-appeal the Court of Appeal’s order, and urged this Court to rule on the issue of standing. It argued that remitting the matter for reconsideration would only cause further delay. I agree. In my view, it is in the interests of justice to grant leave to cross-appeal in the circumstances, and address the standing issue. Courts may grant public interest standing in the exercise of their inherent jurisdiction whenever it is just to do so (Morgentaler v. New Brunswick, 2009 NBCA 26, 344 N.B.R. (2d) 39, at para. 51).

[79]                        I note that rulings on standing are discretionary, and are thus “entitled to deference on appeal” (Strickland v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 37, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 713, at para. 39). In the case at bar, however, there are errors in the decisions of the courts below that justify our intervention.

[80]                        My analysis in this regard will proceed in two parts. First, I will outline the errors made by the courts below. Second, I will apply and weigh each of the Downtown Eastside factors before concluding that, cumulatively, these factors favour granting public interest standing in the circumstances.

(1)         Errors in the Courts Below

(a)           Chambers Judge

[81]                          The chambers judge made a number of errors in his interpretation and application of the Downtown Eastside factors.

(i)              Errors With Respect to the Serious Justiciable Issue Factor

[82]                          The chambers judge concluded that CCD failed to raise a justiciable issue, but his analysis on this point was insufficient. He (and the Court of Appeal) reduced the inquiry to whether it was necessary for the plaintiff to plead facts relating to specific individuals: the chambers judge held that it was, while the Court of Appeal held that it was not.

[83]                          This approach misses the point of the “justiciability” inquiry, which is directed at maintaining an appropriate boundary between an impermissible “private reference” and a proper grant of public interest standing (see, e.g., Borowski (1989), at p. 367). Whether facts relative to specific individuals are or are not pleaded may be a relevant factor, but it is not, in itself, the point to be decided, nor is it determinative.

[84]                          As I will explain below, while it is true that purely hypothetical claims are not justiciable, there is an undisputed cause of action here. CCD has alleged facts which, if proven, could support a constitutional claim.

(ii)           Errors With Respect to the Genuine Interest Factor

[85]                          The chambers judge also erred in his assessment on the existence of a genuine interest. He found that CCD’s interest only “weakly” met the genuine interest criterion, because its work is focused primarily on “disabilities” and not on “mental disabilities”. With respect, this distinction between “mental disabilities” and “disabilities” is unhelpful, and unfounded. Mental disabilities are disabilities (Saadati v. Moorhead, 2017 SCC 28, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 543, at paras. 2 and 35).

(iii)         Errors With Respect to the Reasonable and Effective Means Factor

[86]                          The chambers judge concluded that CCD failed to establish that its suit was a reasonable and effective means of bringing the issues forward. He voiced four concerns in this regard:

1.      CCD failed to lead adequate evidence of a “sufficiently concrete and well-developed factual setting” upon which the action could be tried (para. 69);

2.      CCD failed to persuade the chambers judge that it could fairly represent the interests of everyone affected by the impugned provisions (para. 76);

3.      CCD had engaged in “little advocacy for mental illness” in comparison with its advocacy efforts regarding physical disability (para. 74); and

4.      CCD failed to explain why it was unrealistic for individuals who have experienced the impacts of the impugned provisions to bring and see through a challenge themselves (paras. 77-95).

[87]                        It was not open to the chambers judge to afford these concerns the decisive weight he did. I will address each concern in turn.

[88]                          The first concern relates to the concrete factual setting needed to resolve constitutional claims. As I noted above, this consideration is one of many a court may take into account when deciding whether a suit is a reasonable and effective means of advancing the claim. The chambers judge, however, attached determinative weight, at several points in his reasons, to the alleged absence of a robust factual setting (paras. 37-39, 61, 67 and 69). 

[89]                          The chambers judge’s approach contradicts Downtown Eastside, in which this Court affirmed that none of the factors are “hard and fast requirements” or “freestanding, independently operating tests” (para. 20). They are instead to be assessed and weighed cumulatively. It follows that at this early stage, where the question is simply whether a sufficient factual setting will exist, this consideration is not determinative on its own.

[90]                          The second concern relates to the interests of others who are affected by the impugned legislation. The chambers judge surmised that CCD was not in a position to “fairly represent” everyone’s interests. But public interest standing has never depended on whether the plaintiff represents the interests of all, or even a majority of, directly affected individuals. What matters is whether there is a serious justiciable issue, whether the plaintiff has a genuine interest, and whether the suit is a reasonable and effective means of litigating the issue.

[91]                          The third concern expressed by the chambers judge relates to CCD’s status as an advocate for people with mental disabilities. The chambers judge questioned whether CCD’s advocacy efforts “commend[ed] it as an advocate for those with mental health-related disabilities”, and mentioned that its argument seemed to focus on “the extent to which mental illness should be considered a disability” (para. 74). This concern rests on the unfounded distinction between mental and physical disabilities which I discussed above.

[92]                          The fourth concern relates to the availability of other individuals who might have direct standing to challenge the claim. The chambers judge considered that some individuals affected by the impugned provisions might be willing or able to participate in CCD’s constitutional challenge “if funded and supported by the CCD”, and that there were therefore “other reasonable and effective ways to bring the issues” forward (paras. 95 and 97).

[93]                          This final concern is problematic for two reasons. First, Downtown Eastside instructs courts to take a “practical” and “pragmatic” approach to the existence of potential plaintiffs. The “practical prospects” of such plaintiffs bringing the matter to court “should be considered in light of the practical realities, not theoretical possibilities” (para. 51). There was no analysis in this regard in the chambers judge’s reasons. Although other plaintiffs have advanced constitutional challenges to these provisions, none of them were able to see their challenges through to completion.

[94]                          Second, the chambers judge’s fourth concern attaches undue weight to the importance of an individual plaintiff. But as I explained above, Downtown Eastside sets out no requirement for such a plaintiff. Instead, it directs courts to consider whether the plaintiff’s claim is a reasonable and effective means of bringing the case to court, regardless of whether other reasonable and effective means exist (para. 44).

(b)         Court of Appeal

[95]                        The Court of Appeal’s analysis was limited to a review of the chambers judge’s conclusion on the question whether CCD’s case raised a serious justiciable issue. The Court of Appeal did not apply Downtown Eastside to determine whether, in all the circumstances, the chambers judge’s decision to deny standing was justified. Instead, it identified an error with regard to one factor and remitted the matter to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for fresh consideration.

[96]                        This itself was an error. The Court of Appeal dealt with the first Downtown Eastside factor individually but did not consider it in conjunction with the other two factors. This approach contradicts Downtown Eastside, which requires a court to weigh the three factors cumulatively. In short, the Court of Appeal determined that the trial judge had made a palpable error, but it did not go on to weigh all the factors cumulatively in order to determine whether that error was overriding.

(2)         Downtown Eastside Framework Favours Granting Standing in the Instant Case

[97]                        These errors require this Court to do what the Court of Appeal did not: weigh all of the Downtown Eastside factors cumulatively, flexibly and purposively.

(a)           Serious Justiciable Issue

[98]                        CCD’s pleadings are well drafted, and they raise a serious issue: the constitutionality of laws that implicate — and allegedly violate — the Charter rights of people with mental disabilities. This issue is “far from frivolous”, “important”, and “substantial” (Downtown Eastside, at para. 42, citing Finlay, at p. 633, Borowski (1981), at p. 589, and McNeil, at p. 268).

[99]                        Bearing in mind that CCD’s case is still at the pleadings stage, I also find that the issue is justiciable. The amended notice of civil claim sets out material facts outlining the core of the case. These include the following:

1.      the impugned provisions permit health care providers to forcibly administer psychotropic medication, electroconvulsive therapy and psychosurgery to involuntary patients even though these treatments carry a number of serious risks and potentially fatal side-effects;

2.      health care providers administer these treatments by, among other things, demanding patients’ cooperation, using physical force and threatening physical restraint or detention when patients are uncooperative or refuse consent, even where patients are capable of making decisions regarding psychiatric treatment; and

3.      the use and threatened use of forced psychiatric treatment can cause physical harm and severe psychological pain and stress.

[100]                     CCD’s pleadings reveal an undisputed cause of action. CCD alleges facts which, if proven, could support a constitutional claim: “Where there are aspects of the claim that clearly raise serious justiciable issues, it is better for the purposes of the standing analysis not to get into a detailed screening of the merits of discrete and particular aspects of the claim” (Downtown Eastside, at para. 56).

(b)         Genuine Interest

[101]                     It is clear to me from the uncontested Bernard affidavit that CCD has a genuine interest in the issues, and in the challenges faced by people with mental disabilities:

1.      CCD’s work is directed “by and for people with disabilities”, including mental disabilities.

2.      CCD has a long history of engagement in social, legal, and policy reform initiatives aimed at reducing stereotyping and discrimination and promoting the fundamental equality and human rights of people with disabilities. For example, it acts as a consultant to the Government of Canada on issues relating to disabilities.

3.      CCD has repeatedly been recognized by international bodies, governments, and courts as an authoritative and respected voice regarding the rights, autonomy, and equality of people with disabilities, including people with mental disabilities.

4.      CCD’s board of directors conducts most of its work through committees with special mandates, including the Mental Health Committee, whose members have specific mental health-related expertise and which is responsible for the litigation in the instant case.

5.      CCD has participated as a plaintiff or as an intervener in other cases relating to human rights and equality issues under the Charter, all of which involved the rights of people with disabilities.

[102]                     The AGBC argues that CCD’s work does not focus narrowly on people with “mental illness” (A.F., at paras. 4, 92 and 98). This argument misses the point: a plaintiff seeking public interest standing has never been required to show that its interests are precisely as narrow as the litigation it seeks to bring. Instead, it must demonstrate a “link with the claim” and an “interest in the issues” (Downtown Eastside, at para. 43 (emphasis added)).

[103]                     I am therefore satisfied that CCD has “a real stake in the proceedings”, “is engaged with the issues” and is no “mere busybody” (Downtown Eastside, at para. 43).

(c)           Reasonable and Effective Means

[104]                     Downtown Eastside invites courts to consider a series of “interrelated matters” when assessing the reasonable and effective means factor, including (i) the plaintiff’s capacity to bring the claim forward; (ii) whether the case is of public interest and what impact it will have on access to justice; (iii) whether there are alternative means to bring the claim forward, including parallel proceedings; and (iv) the potential impact of the proceedings on the rights of others.

(i)              Plaintiff’s Capacity to Bring the Claim Forward

[105]                     CCD boasts impressive resources and expertise. It is a sizeable, highly reputable public interest organization represented by excellent pro bono counsel and backed by a law firm that has already committed significant resources to this litigation. There is no doubt that CCD commands the necessary resources and expertise to advance the claim it asserts.

[106]                     Furthermore, I am satisfied that a “sufficiently concrete and well-developed factual setting” will be forthcoming. CCD’s work is directed “by and for” people with disabilities, including mental disabilities. It is therefore reasonable to infer that CCD has the capacity to adduce evidence from directly affected individuals. Moreover, the pleadings reveal that this case does not turn on individual facts. Much of the case can be argued on the basis that the legislation is unconstitutional on its face because it authorizes, under certain circumstances, forced psychiatric treatment without the consent of the patient or of a substitute decision-maker. Expert evidence regarding how health care providers treat involuntary patients and evidence with respect to particular patients may provide helpful insight into how the legislation is applied. At this early stage of the litigation, however, information about individual plaintiffs would not add much value.

[107]                     The representations of counsel and Ms. Benard’s sworn statement that CCD will adduce evidence, while insufficient on their own, also help to assure this Court that the issues will be litigated in a sufficient factual setting. Counsel for CCD also made an undertaking at the hearing to provide evidence of the concrete circumstances of specific patients. This undertaking helps to alleviate any lingering concerns about the forthcoming nature of a sufficient factual background.

[108]                     Finally, I note that it will still be open to the AGBC to challenge CCD’s standing should CCD fail to adduce the factual setting it undertook to adduce. It would make sense in this case to limit such a challenge to the stage following discovery.

[109]                     I would pause to observe that standing is fact- and context-specific. This is an appropriate result in this case; it may not be appropriate in other cases. Rather than using the “blunt instrument” of denying standing, it is appropriate here to use various litigation management tools — like the possibility of revisiting standing — to ensure that the evidence in question is in fact tendered promptly.

(ii)           Whether the Case is of Public Interest

[110]                     CCD’s claim undoubtedly raises issues of public importance that transcend its immediate interests (see, e.g., Downtown Eastside, at para. 73). The litigation has the potential of affecting a large group of people, namely people with mental disabilities. Moreover, granting public interest standing in this case will promote access to justice for a disadvantaged group who has historically faced serious barriers to bringing such litigation before the courts.

(iii)         Realistic Alternative Means

[111]                     I must also consider whether there are realistic alternative means which would favour a more efficient and effective use of judicial resources and would present a context more suitable for adversarial determination (Downtown Eastside, at para. 51). In this regard, the Court of Appeal took notice of an action that has been commenced under the Class Proceedings Act, to challenge the same statutory provisions that are at issue in this appeal. As of now, that class action has not yet been certified.

[112]                     The AGBC points to the class action as a better vehicle for bringing these issues to court, but he argues in the class action itself that the action is statute-barred and should therefore not be certified.

[113]                     Although the class action is relevant, it is not determinative (Downtown Eastside, at para. 67). In my view, CCD provides two compelling reasons to support its argument that its claim is a reasonable and effective means of bringing the issue before the court despite this parallel proceeding.

[114]                     First, the class action is rife with unknowns: the record does not confirm that the proceeding has been certified. Even if it is certified, the certified common issues may not address the constitutionality of the impugned provisions. There is no information about the evidence that is to be adduced in the proposed class proceeding. In any case, the primary focus of such proceedings is to obtain damages, which often leads to settlements rather than to rulings on alleged Charter violations. As a result, I cannot conclude that the class action represents a more efficient and effective means of resolving the Charter issues raised by CCD.

[115]                     Second, the uncontested evidence from the Benard affidavit is that individuals directly affected by the impugned provisions face significant barriers to commencing constitutional litigation and seeing it through. In this case, directly affected individuals suffer from mental disabilities that could affect their capacity to bring lengthy, complex litigation and to stay its course. Some may fear reprisals from health care providers who, under the legislation at issue, control their psychiatric treatment. Or they may hesitate to expose themselves to the unfortunate stigma that can accompany public disclosure of their private health information. CCD taking on the role as plaintiff in this litigation alleviates those significant barriers.

[116]                     Though fully capable of advancing litigation, individuals with mental disabilities must overcome significant personal and institutional hurdles to do so. Mindful of this, I would not attach determinative weight to the parallel claim in balancing the factors.

(iv)         Potential Impact of the Proceeding on the Rights of Others

[117]                     The AGBC argues that CCD’s claim may prejudice people who support the impugned provisions. I would attach little weight to this concern. Support for a law should not immunize it from constitutional challenge. If the impugned provisions are unconstitutional, they should be struck down.

(3)         Cumulative Weighing

[118]                     Having cumulatively weighed each of the Downtown Eastside factors, I would exercise my discretion in favour of granting CCD public interest standing. If CCD fails to promptly adduce the promised factual setting, the AGBC can apply to have the issue of standing reconsidered at the conclusion of the discovery stage. I would again stress that while this result is appropriate in the specific context of this case, it may not be appropriate in others.

D.           Special Costs

[119]                     CCD seeks an award of special costs on a full indemnity basis throughout. Special costs are exceptional and discretionary (Carter, at paras. 137 and 140). To award special costs, two criteria must be met:

1.      the case must involve matters of public interest that have a “significant and widespread societal impact” and are “truly exceptional” (Carter, at para. 140); and

2.      the plaintiff must show that it has no personal, proprietary or pecuniary interest that would justify the proceedings on economic grounds, and that it would not have been possible to effectively pursue the litigation in question with private funding (Carter, at para. 140).

[120]                     CCD’s case satisfies both of these criteria. Regarding the first criterion, the scope of public interest standing and the circumstances in which organizations may pursue public interest litigation without an individual plaintiff is a matter of public interest that has a significant and widespread societal impact. The participation of over 20 interveners from across the country representing a range of interests and perspectives with respect to this appeal is a testament to this fact.

[121]                     As for the second criterion, CCD is a not-for-profit organization whose mandate is to promote the equality, autonomy and rights of people with disabilities. It has no personal, proprietary or pecuniary interest in this litigation. Moreover, it would not have been possible for CCD to pursue the litigation effectively with private funding; it has relied upon pro bono counsel to argue its case.

[122]                     CCD has sought to advance the litigation for nearly six years. The substantive issues have yet to be addressed. In such circumstances, having regard to the strict criteria for special costs, it would be “contrary to the interests of justice to ask [CCD and its pro bono counsel] to bear the majority of the financial burden associated with pursuing the claim” (Carter, at para. 140).

[123]                     In these exceptional circumstances, and in the exercise of my discretion, I would grant special costs in this Court and in the courts below to place CCD — as far as it is possible to do so financially — in the position it was in when the AGBC called its standing into question.

VI.         Disposition

[124]                     For these reasons, I would dismiss the AGBC’s appeal. I would grant leave to cross-appeal to CCD, allow its cross-appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal remitting the question of CCD’s public interest standing to the Supreme Court of British Columbia, and grant CCD public interest standing. Special costs on a full indemnity basis are awarded to CCD throughout. 

 

                    Appeal dismissed and cross‑appeal allowed.

I.               Overview

[1]                              The criminal trial process can be invasive, humiliating, and degrading for victims of sexual offences, in part because myths and stereotypes continue to haunt the criminal justice system. Historically, trials provided few if any protections for complainants. More often than not, they could expect to have the minutiae of their lives and character unjustifiably scrutinized in an attempt to intimidate and embarrass them, and call their credibility into question — all of which jeopardized the truth-seeking function of the trial. It also undermined the dignity, equality, and privacy of those who had the courage to lay a complaint and undergo the rigours of a public trial.

[2]                              Over the past decades, Parliament has made a number of changes to trial procedure, attempting to balance the accused’s right to a fair trial; the complainant’s dignity, equality, and privacy; and the public’s interest in the search for truth. This effort is ongoing, but statistics and well-documented complainant accounts continue to paint a bleak picture. Most victims of sexual offences do not report such crimes; and for those that do, only a fraction of reported offences result in a completed prosecution. More needs to be done.

[3]                              These appeals concern the constitutionality of Bill C-51, a recent ameliorative effort by Parliament to remove the barriers that have deterred complainants from coming forward. This bill, which was enacted in 2018 (An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Department of Justice Act and to make consequential amendments to another Act, S.C. 2018, c. 29), introduced ss. 278.92 to 278.94 into the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (“impugned provisions”). These provisions were designed to protect the interests of complainants in their own private records when an accused has possession or control of the records and seeks to introduce them at a hearing in their criminal proceeding. Specifically, they create procedures and criteria to assist the judge in deciding whether the records should be admitted, balancing the rights and interests of the accused, the complainant, and the public. Some of the procedural elements of the impugned provisions also apply to s. 276 evidence applications, as Parliament repealed the prior procedural provisions governing such applications.

[4]                              Prior to Bill C-51, there was no statutory procedure governing the admissibility of complainants’ private records held by accused persons. There were, however, procedures governing the admissibility of evidence of complainants’ prior sexual activity or history (“s. 276 regime”) and of complainants’ private records in the hands of third parties (“third party production regime”). This Court has affirmed the constitutionality of both regimes (see R. v. Mills, 1999 CanLII 637 (SCC), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 668; R. v. Darrach, 2000 SCC 46, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 443). In order to contextualize Bill C-51, it is helpful to consider the regime changes that preceded it in further detail.

[5]                              The first set of legislative changes sought to expose and eliminate two insidious myths — commonly referred to as the “twin myths” — which allowed the use of complainants’ prior sexual history to suggest that they were (1) less worthy of belief and/or (2) more likely to have consented to the alleged assault. These myths had long been used to attack the credibility and dignity of complainants, tarnish their reputations, and sideline the truth-seeking function of a criminal trial. Recognizing the harm caused by them, Parliament enacted legislation to govern the use of evidence relating to complainants’ prior sexual history. While Parliament’s first iteration of s. 276 was found to be overbroad in R. v. Seaboyer, 1991 CanLII 76 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, revised provisions were found by this Court to be constitutionally compliant in Darrach. This general framework remains in place today, albeit in amended form.

[6]                              The second set of legislative changes sought to restrict what had become a routine practice — defence counsel seeking production of complainants’ private records in order to engage in invasive attacks on their character. For example, defence counsel often sought production of medical records in order to advance myth-based arguments impugning the credibility and reliability of complainants who had previously consulted with psychiatrists or counsellors. This problem was first addressed in R. v. O’Connor, 1995 CanLII 51 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, resulting in the creation of a common law procedure governing the production of complainants’ private records by third parties. Parliament subsequently legislated its own procedure (ss. 278.1 to 278.91 of the Criminal Code), which drew upon but modified the O’Connor procedure. This Court affirmed the constitutionality of that regime in Mills, finding that it struck a reasonable balance between the rights of the accused, the rights of the complainant, and the public interest.

[7]                              A third problem emerged. In R. v. Osolin, 1993 CanLII 54 (SCC), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, the Court addressed a situation where the defence cross-examined the complainant on the basis of her personal medical records, which had come into the accused’s possession. Similarly, in R. v. Shearing, 2002 SCC 58, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 33, the Court was confronted with a situation where the accused sought to cross-examine the complainant based on entries in her own private diary, which happened to be in the accused’s possession. Since the accused already had the diary, there was no need to seek production through the third party production regime. The main issue was the admissibility of the diary. In the absence of legislation, the Court endorsed the use of motions brought at the instance of complainants to protect against the improper use of their private documents already in the hands of accused persons.

[8]                              Following Osolin and Shearing, it became clear that there was no legislation governing the admissibility of a complainant’s private records in the hands of the accused, rather than a third party — even though the complainant’s privacy and dignity interests are similar in both contexts. A 2012 Senate report recommended creating legislation designed to address this gap: a regime governing the admissibility of complainants’ private records in the hands of the accused, using similar factors to those in the third party production regime (Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, Statutory Review on the Provisions and Operation of the Act to amend the Criminal Code (production of records in sexual offence proceedings): Final Report (“2012 Senate Report”), at p. 19).

[9]                              Bill C-51 was Parliament’s response. Among other features, it extended the protections provided to complainants in sexual offence trials in two ways. First, it created a new procedure to determine whether the complainant’s private records in the hands of the accused are admissible as evidence at trial (“record screening regime”). Second, it provided complainants with additional participation rights in admissibility proceedings under the new record screening regime and the pre-existing s. 276 regime for prior sexual history evidence (“complainant participation provisions”).

[10]                          In the two appeals presently before the Court, each accused (J.J. and Shane Reddick) brought a pre-trial application challenging the constitutionality of the impugned provisions, arguing that Parliament had moved too far in favour of protecting the interests of complainants, and in the process, had jeopardized three fundamental rights guaranteed to accused persons under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, namely: the right to silence and privilege against self-incrimination under ss. 7 and 11(c); the right to a fair trial under ss. 7 and 11(d); and the right to make full answer and defence under ss. 7 and 11(d). The judges in both cases granted the applications and found the provisions unconstitutional, in whole or in part (see the Charter breach analysis in R. v. J.J., 2020 BCSC 29, and the s. 1 analysis and decision on remedy in R. v. J.J., 2020 BCSC 349; and see R. v. Reddick, 2020 ONSC 7156, 398 C.C.C. (3d) 227). In Mr. Reddick’s case, part of the application judge’s ruling included a finding that s. 278.92 was overbroad under s. 7 of the Charter.

[11]                          In J.J.’s case, this Court granted the Crown’s application for leave to appeal from the application judge’s interlocutory constitutional ruling, which held that part of the record screening regime was unconstitutional. The Court also granted J.J.’s later application for leave to cross-appeal on the issue of the constitutionality of the regime in its entirety. In Mr. Reddick’s case, the complainant, A.S., sought to challenge the application judge’s interlocutory constitutional ruling that effectively prevented her from participating in the record screening process and declared the regime unconstitutional in its entirety. This Court granted A.S. the right to be added as a party to the proceedings because, being a complainant, she would not normally have been a party. The Court then granted A.S.’s application for leave to appeal. Mr. Reddick is a respondent on the appeal. The Crown is also a respondent, despite arguing (like A.S.) that the regime as a whole is constitutionally valid.

[12]                          The main arguments of the respondents J.J. and Mr. Reddick were as follows. First, the impugned provisions force the defence to disclose both its strategy and the details of its proposed evidence to the Crown prior to trial, thereby violating the right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination. Second, the impugned provisions provide complainants with advanced notice of defence evidence and the purposes for which it is being adduced. As a result, complainants will be able to tailor their responses during examination-in-chief and cross-examination. This detracts from the right to make full answer and defence and from the truth-seeking function of trial. Finally, complainant participation in voir dires threatens trial fairness, as it disrupts the structure of a criminal trial, inserts a third-party adversary into the process, and undermines the role of the Crown.

[13]                          For the reasons that follow, we would not give effect to these arguments. Properly construed, ss. 278.92 to 278.94 of the Criminal Code do not infringe upon ss. 7, 11(c), or 11(d) of the Charter. In the result, we would allow the Crown’s appeal and dismiss J.J.’s cross-appeal; we would also allow A.S.’s appeal.

[14]                          We have had the benefit of reading the dissenting reasons prepared by our colleague Côté J. With respect, we cannot accede to her interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions, as we consider it to be unduly narrow and restrictive. We have also read the separate dissenting reasons of our colleagues Brown J. and Rowe J. Respectfully, they have mischaracterized our reasons and their effect and disregarded the principle of stare decisis — sweeping aside decades of this Court’s binding jurisprudence as “judicial ad hoc-ery”. Quite simply, their approach to the constitutional analysis must be rejected.

II.            Relevant Statutory Provisions

[15]                        The following provisions of the Criminal Code are relevant to these appeals:

(a)   is more likely to have consented to the sexual activity that forms the subject matter of the charge; or

(b)  is less worthy of belief.

Conditions for admissibility

(2) In proceedings in respect of an offence referred to in subsection (1), evidence shall not be adduced by or on behalf of the accused that the complainant has engaged in sexual activity other than the sexual activity that forms the subject matter of the charge, whether with the accused or with any other person, unless the judge, provincial court judge or justice determines, in accordance with the procedures set out in sections 278.93 and 278.94, that the evidence

(a)   is not being adduced for the purpose of supporting an inference described in subsection (1);

(b)  is relevant to an issue at trial; and

(c)   is of specific instances of sexual activity; and

(d)  has significant probative value that is not substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice.

Factors that judge must consider

(3) In determining whether evidence is admissible under subsection (2), the judge, provincial court judge or justice shall take into account

(a)   the interests of justice, including the right of the accused to make a full answer and defence;

(b)  society’s interest in encouraging the reporting of sexual assault offences;

(c)   whether there is a reasonable prospect that the evidence will assist in arriving at a just determination in the case;

(d)  the need to remove from the fact-finding process any discriminatory belief or bias;

(e)   the risk that the evidence may unduly arouse sentiments of prejudice, sympathy or hostility in the jury;

(g)   the right of the complainant and of every individual to personal security and to the full protection and benefit of the law; and

(h)  any other factor that the judge, provincial court judge or justice considers relevant.

Interpretation

. . .

Definition of record

278.1 For the purposes of sections 278.2 to 278.92, record means any form of record that contains personal information for which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy and includes medical, psychiatric, therapeutic, counselling, education, employment, child welfare, adoption and social services records, personal journals and diaries, and records containing personal information the production or disclosure of which is protected by any other Act of Parliament or a provincial legislature, but does not include records made by persons responsible for the investigation or prosecution of the offence.

. . .

Admissibility — accused in possession of records relating to complainant

278.92(1) Except in accordance with this section, no record relating to a complainant that is in the possession or control of the accused — and which the accused intends to adduce — shall be admitted in evidence in any proceedings in respect of any of the following offences or in any proceedings in respect of two or more offences at least one of which is any of the following offences:

(a)   an offence under section 151, 152, 153, 153.1, 155, 160, 170, 171, 172, 173, 213, 271, 272, 273, 279.01, 279.011, 279.02, 279.03, 286.1, 286.2 or 286.3; or

Record of reasons

(5) The reasons provided under subsection (4) shall be entered in the record of the proceedings or, if the proceedings are not recorded, shall be provided in writing.

III.         Issues

[16]                        These appeals call into question the constitutionality of ss. 278.92 to 278.94 of the Criminal Code. It is alleged that the impugned provisions violate the rights of accused persons under ss. 7, 11(c) and 11(d) of the Charter and should be struck down.

IV.         Analysis

A.           Statutory Interpretation of the Provisions

[17]                        Before determining the constitutionality of the impugned provisions, it is first necessary to interpret them. The modern principle of statutory interpretation assists us in this exercise: “. . . the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament” (E. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87, quoted in Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), 1998 CanLII 837 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21).

[18]                        As a rule, “[c]ourts must presume that Parliament intended to enact constitutional, [Charter-compliant] legislation and strive, where possible, to give effect to this intention” (Mills, at para. 56; see also R. Sullivan, Statutory Interpretation (3rd ed. 2016), at pp. 307-8; R. v. Ahmad, 2011 SCC 6, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 110, at paras. 28-29). Furthermore, this Court stated in Mills that “if legislation is amenable to two interpretations, a court should choose the interpretation that upholds the legislation as constitutional” (para. 56, referring to Slaight Communications Inc. v. Davidson, 1989 CanLII 92 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038, at p. 1078).

(1)         Overview of the Impugned Provisions

[19]                        With these interpretive tools in mind, we begin by providing an overview of the provisions to set the foundation for the more detailed interpretation of each section.

[20]                        As a preliminary matter, the procedures outlined in ss. 278.92 to 278.94 apply to two types of evidence:

(1)         Evidence of complainants’ prior sexual history under s. 276 (“s. 276 evidence”), which was previously subject to its own procedure. This type of evidence requires “s. 276 applications”. Prior to Bill C-51, s. 276 evidence was subject to the procedures in ss. 276.1 to 276.5 of the Criminal Code, which have since been repealed.

(2)         Other records in the possession or control of the accused that fall within the definition of s. 278.1, which do not concern prior sexual history. This type of evidence requires “private record applications”.

[21]                        The procedure set out in the impugned provisions operates in two stages, as follows.

(a)           Stage One

[22]                        Pursuant to s. 278.93(2), the accused must prepare an application which “set[s] out detailed particulars of the evidence that the accused seeks to adduce and the relevance of that evidence to an issue at trial”.

[23]                        At Stage One, the presiding judge reviews the accused’s application to determine whether the evidence sought to be adduced is capable of being admissible having regard to the threshold tests set out in s. 278.92(2)(a) and (b) and the applicable factors in ss. 276(3) or 278.92(3), depending on the type of evidence.

[24]                        We note what is, in our view, a drafting error in the English text of s. 278.93(4). As written, this section requires the judge at Stage One to assess whether the proposed evidence is “capable of being admissible under subsection 276(2)”. However, it is clear that s. 276(2) only applies to evidence of complainants’ prior sexual history. This leaves no “capable of being admissible” threshold for private records at Stage One. This sentence must be meant to refer to s. 278.92(2), which sets out both the threshold for evidence of prior sexual history (s. 278.92(2)(a)) and the threshold for private records (s. 278.92(2)(b)). This is consistent with the Attorney General of Ontario’s explanation of the Stage One process in its factums. Moreover, it is consistent with the French text of the provision, which does not refer to s. 276(2) when setting out the threshold for determining whether a record is “capable of being admissible” in s. 278.93(4).

[25]                        The use of s. 276(2) as the only threshold in the English version is a drafting error that leads to “a glaring absurdity, the origin of which is evident” (Sullivan (2016), at p. 298). Specifically, it is evident that the phrase “capable of being admissible under subsection 276(2)” is a holdover from the prior procedural regime, which only applied to s. 276 evidence. As a result, we proceed on the understanding that the “capable of being admissible” threshold in s. 278.93(4) is intended to refer to evidence that is “capable of being admissible” under s. 278.92(2).

[26]                        Section 278.93(4) stipulates that the accused must provide a copy of the application to the court and the Crown, at least seven days before the presiding judge reviews the application, unless otherwise ordered. Advanced disclosure to the Crown is necessary to provide the Crown with an opportunity to consider its position regarding whether the evidence is capable of being admissible.

[27]                        The legislation does not specify how the Stage One inquiry is to be conducted. In our view, this is a matter left to the discretion of the presiding judge, in accordance with their trial management powers. The Stage One inquiry may proceed as an application in writing, an oral hearing, or both, as the judge sees fit. The jury and public are excluded from the Stage One inquiry, no matter how it proceeds, under s. 278.93(3).

[28]                        For s. 276 evidence applications, if the judge determines that the proposed evidence is not s. 276 evidence, the application will terminate. If the proposed evidence is s. 276 evidence but the judge concludes that it is not capable of being admissible under s. 276(2) (as directed by s. 278.92(2)(a)), the application will be denied. If the s. 276 evidence is capable of being admissible, the application proceeds to a Stage Two hearing pursuant to s. 278.93(4).

[29]                        For private record applications, if the judge determines that the proposed evidence is not a “record” under s. 278.1, the application will terminate. If the proposed evidence is a “record” under s. 278.1 but the judge concludes that it is not capable of being admissible under s. 278.92(2)(b), the application will be denied. If the evidence is a “record” and it is capable of being admissible, the application proceeds to a Stage Two hearing pursuant to s. 278.93(4).

(b)         Stage Two

[30]                        At the Stage Two hearing, the presiding judge decides whether the proposed evidence meets the tests for admissibility set out in s. 278.92(2).

[31]                        For s. 276 evidence applications, the governing conditions are set out in s. 276(2), as directed by s. 278.92(2)(a). This determination is made in accordance with the factors listed in s. 276(3).

[32]                        For private record applications, the test for admissibility is set out in s. 278.92(2)(b), namely: the evidence is admissible if it “is relevant to an issue at trial and has significant probative value that is not substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice”. This determination is made in accordance with the factors listed in s. 278.92(3).

[33]                        Complainants are permitted to appear at the Stage Two hearing and make submissions, with the assistance of counsel, if they so choose (s. 278.94(2) and (3)).

(c)           Overlap Between Section 276 Evidence and Private Records Under Section 278.1

[34]                        Section 276 of the Criminal Code prohibits the use of evidence of complainants’ prior sexual history to support the “twin myths” in sexual offence trials. At some point in the process, the presiding judge may determine that the proposed evidence is both s. 276 evidence and a private record under s. 278.1 (e.g., an email containing an explicit photo of a prior sexual interaction). If the judge determines that the evidence falls under both categories, then it should be treated as s. 276 evidence.

(2)         What Is a Record?

[35]                          To determine what qualifies as a “record” for private record applications, the starting point is s. 278.1. It reads as follows:

278.1 For the purposes of sections 278.2 to 278.92, record means any form of record that contains personal information for which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy and includes medical, psychiatric, therapeutic, counselling, education, employment, child welfare, adoption and social services records, personal journals and diaries, and records containing personal information the production or disclosure of which is protected by any other Act of Parliament or a provincial legislature, but does not include records made by persons responsible for the investigation or prosecution of the offence.

[36]                          The definition of “record” in s. 278.1 applies to ss. 278.2 to 278.92 of the Criminal Code, which includes both the third party production regime (ss. 278.2 to 278.91) and the record screening regime (ss. 278.92 to 278.94).

[37]                          In this section, we first provide a brief overview that explains the two general groups of records under s. 278.1: enumerated records and non-enumerated records. We then provide guidance on what qualifies as a non-enumerated record. To do so, we consider Parliament’s intent, the statutory text, and relevant jurisprudence, from which we derive a methodology for determining whether evidence falls within the definition of “record” for purposes of the record screening regime. Finally, we provide guidance on two specific types of records: (1) communications; and (2) records of an explicit sexual nature related to the subject matter of the charge.

(a)           Two Groups of Records

[38]                          The definition of “record” creates two distinct groups: (1) records that fall within the enumerated categories (“enumerated records”); and (2) records that do not fall within the enumerated categories but otherwise contain personal information for which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy (“non-enumerated records”).

[39]                          Enumerated categories of records, as defined in s. 278.1, include “medical, psychiatric, therapeutic, counselling, education, employment, child welfare, adoption and social services records, personal journals and diaries, and records containing personal information the production or disclosure of which is protected by any other Act of Parliament or a provincial legislature”. In our view, these categories were enumerated in the definition because they are the types of records likely to contain personal information for which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. Should an accused wish to tender a record that falls within an enumerated category, they must proceed with a s. 278.93(1) application, regardless of the specific content of the record.

[40]                          However, Parliament’s use of the word “includes” in the definition signals that the list of enumerated categories was not meant to be exhaustive. This is confirmed in R. v. Quesnelle, 2014 SCC 46, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 390, where Karakatsanis J., writing for the Court, stated that the list of enumerated records in s. 278.1 “provides an illustrative list of some of the types of records that usually give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy. However, documents that do not fall into the listed categories will still be covered by the Mills regime if they contain [personal] information that gives rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy” (para. 22).

[41]                          In other words, records that do not fall within one of the enumerated categories but are nevertheless included within the scope of the regime are records which contain personal information about complainants for which they have a reasonable expectation of privacy. We expand on this below.

(b)         Identifying Non-Enumerated Records

[42]                          Ultimately, we conclude that a non-enumerated record will only be captured by s. 278.1, in the context of the record screening regime, if the record contains information of an intimate or highly personal nature that is integral to the complainant’s overall physical, psychological or emotional well-being. Such information will have implications for the complainant’s dignity. As we will explain, this threshold is informed by interpreting the text and scheme of the record screening regime. We then provide a framework for assessing whether a piece of evidence qualifies as a non-enumerated record that must be vetted under the record screening regime.

(i)              Text and Scheme of the Record Screening Regime

[43]                          The text and scheme of the record screening regime reveal Parliament’s intention to narrow the scope of records. Parliament deliberately limited the regime to “personal information for which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy”. Both elements of this phrase — “personal information” and “reasonable expectation of privacy” — serve to delimit the scope of records and shed light on the nature of the privacy interests at issue, as do the factors set out in s. 278.92(3).

1.               Personal Information

[44]                          The term “personal information” invokes the concept of informational privacy. Informational privacy protects the ability to control the dissemination of intimate and personal details about oneself that go to one’s “biographical core” (R. v. Plant, 1993 CanLII 70 (SCC), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 281, at p. 293; see also R. v. Cole, 2012 SCC 53, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 34, at paras. 45-48). As this Court held in R. v. Dyment, 1988 CanLII 10 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 417, informational privacy is “based on the notion of the dignity and integrity of the individual” (p. 429).

[45]                          Complainants have privacy interests in highly sensitive information about themselves, the disclosure of which can impact on their dignity. As this Court has observed in the past, the “dissemination of highly sensitive personal information” can result “not just in discomfort or embarrassment, but in an affront to the affected person’s dignity” (Sherman Estate v. Donovan, 2021 SCC 25, at para. 7). To reach the level of an impact on dignity, an intrusion on informational privacy must “transcen[d] personal inconvenience by reason of the highly sensitive nature of the information that might be revealed” (Sherman Estate, at para. 75; see also para. 73).

2.               Reasonable Expectation of Privacy

[46]                        The term “reasonable expectation of privacy” has an established meaning in common law, most frequently considered in the s. 8 Charter jurisprudence. When Parliament uses a common law term or concept in legislation, those terms and concepts “inform the content and meaning of these words in [the] section” (R. v. Jarvis, 2019 SCC 10, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 488, at para. 56; R. Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (6th ed. 2014), at p. 543). As a result, the jurisprudence regarding a “reasonable expectation of privacy” informs our interpretation. As this Court recognized in Jarvis, “the s. 8 case law represents a rich body of judicial thought on the meaning of privacy in our society” (para. 59). We refer to s. 8 jurisprudence for its foundational principles, but our interpretation of a reasonable expectation of privacy here is specific to s. 278.1: what it means and how it applies in the context of the record screening regime. Contrary to our colleague Brown J.’s dissenting reasons (at para. 201), our context-specific interpretation of a reasonable expectation of privacy cannot be “applied across the board” with the potential to interfere with the s. 8 jurisprudence.

[47]                          In particular, two principles from the s. 8 jurisprudence are instructive in determining whether complainants have a reasonable expectation of privacy under s. 278.1, as it applies to the record screening regime: (1) the person claiming a privacy right must have a subjective expectation of privacy that is objectively reasonable in the circumstances (R. v. Edwards, 1996 CanLII 255 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128, at para. 45; see also Jarvis, at paras. 35‑43); and (2) a reasonable expectation of privacy only engages legally recognized privacy interests (Mills, at para. 99). Both of these principles establish that the privacy interests at issue must meet a high threshold.

[48]                          However, we do not adopt the content-neutral approach from the s. 8 jurisprudence. Under s. 8, a content-neutral approach ensures that an accused may still have a reasonable expectation of privacy regardless of the legal or illegal nature of the items sought (R. v. Spencer, 2014 SCC 43, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 212, at para. 36; R. v. Wong, 1990 CanLII 56 (SCC), [1990] 3 S.C.R. 36, at pp. 49-50). Section 8 protects against unreasonable state search and seizure, therefore, the state is not permitted to engage in ex post facto reasoning to justify unconstitutional searches. This rationale does not apply in the present context as state search and seizure is not at issue.

[49]                        Furthermore, some interveners have submitted that certain mediums of communication (e.g., text messages) should be categorically excluded from the record screening regime, regardless of their content. However, it would be difficult to meaningfully assess or protect complainants’ privacy interests within the strictures of a content-neutral approach, as in s. 8 of the Charter. The definition of “record” in s. 278.1, as it applies in the context of the record screening regime, does not focus on the medium by which the information was shared. It clearly specifies that “any form of record” is captured under the record screening regime if there is personal information for which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. Records do not attract a reasonable expectation of privacy simply because of the medium used to convey them. The more important consideration is the sensitivity of the information contained in the record.

[50]                          Nor is a reasonable expectation of privacy for the purposes of the record screening regime exactly the same as it is for the third party production regime. We acknowledge that the definition of “record” in s. 278.1 is also used in the third party production regime; however, a reasonable expectation of privacy is always context‑specific. As this Court has made clear, the privacy interests in a record being produced to the accused are different from the privacy interests at play when the accused seeks to have the record admitted as evidence in court (Shearing, at para. 96). In sum, while our interpretation of a reasonable expectation of privacy is informed by the s. 8 jurisprudence, including the third party production regime which impacts the s. 8 Charter rights of complainants, our analysis of this term only applies to the record screening regime context.

3.               Factors in Section 278.92(3)

[51]                          The factors outlined in s. 278.92(3) shed light on the interests implicated by the record screening regime, reinforcing our conclusion that Parliament intended to safeguard highly personal information related to complainant dignity. These factors include:

(a)                  the interests of justice, including the right of the accused to make a full answer and defence;

 

(b)                 society’s interest in encouraging the reporting of sexual assault offences;

 

(c)                  society’s interest in encouraging the obtaining of treatment by complainants of sexual offences;

 

(d)                 whether there is a reasonable prospect that the evidence will assist in arriving at a just determination in the case;

 

(e)                  the need to remove from the fact-finding process any discriminatory belief or bias;

 

(f)                  the risk that the evidence may unduly arouse sentiments of prejudice, sympathy or hostility in the jury;

 

(g)                  the potential prejudice to the complainant’s personal dignity and right of privacy;

 

(h)                 the right of the complainant and of every individual to personal security and to the full protection and benefit of the law; and

 

(i)                    any other factor that the judge, provincial court judge or justice considers relevant.

[52]                          A complainant’s privacy interests in the information contained in a record are meant to be assessed against these competing factors. If the information in a record does not engage the factors designed to protect the complainant’s personal dignity and privacy interests, or does so only marginally, this would be a clear indication that the document is not a record at all.

[53]                          In our view, s. 278.1 presupposes that a certain level of privacy must be engaged; namely, this provision concerns only records that could cause “potential prejudice to the complainant’s personal dignity”. These factors suggest that the scheme is not intended to catch more mundane information, even if such information is communicated privately. Moreover, given the accused’s right to make full answer and defence, mere discomfort associated with lesser intrusions of privacy will generally be tolerated. In this context, a complainant’s privacy in open court “will be at serious risk only where the sensitivity of the information strikes at the subject’s more intimate self” (Sherman Estate, at para. 74).

(ii)         Framework to Apply

[54]                        In light of Parliament’s intent, the relevant jurisprudence and the statutory scheme, a non-enumerated record will fall within the definition of s. 278.1 if it contains information of an intimate and highly personal nature that is integral to the complainant’s overall physical, psychological or emotional well-being. Such information will have implications for the complainant’s dignity. As previously stated, this interpretation is specific to the record screening regime. To determine whether a record contains such information, a presiding judge should consider both the content and context of the record.

1.            Content

[55]                          When determining whether proposed evidence constitutes a non-enumerated record, the interpretive principle of ejusdem generis (“of the same kind”) applies. In other words, general words in a definition take their meaning from the more specific words — in this case, the records that are specifically enumerated (Canada v. Canada North Group Inc., 2021 SCC 30, at para. 63). Therefore, if the information in a non-enumerated record is similar to what would be contained in an enumerated record, this is a useful indicator that it raises significant privacy interests and should be subject to the record screening regime. The common thread weaving through the enumerated records is that they contain information of an intimate and highly personal nature that is integral to the complainant’s overall physical, psychological or emotional well-being. This type of content could include, but is not limited to, discussions regarding mental health diagnoses, suicidal ideation, prior physical or sexual abuse, substance abuse or involvement in the child welfare system.

[56]                          For example, if complainants communicate details about their own medical history, this is the kind of information that would be found in a medical record over which they have a reasonable expectation of privacy. It would therefore be subject to the record screening regime. In contrast, mundane information such as general emotional states, everyday occurrences or general biographical information would typically not give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy.

2.            Context

[57]                          A court should also consider the context in which the record came into existence. When assessing context, courts must apply a normative and common-sense approach. Whether a communication or document is a “record that contains personal information for which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy” must reflect societal understandings about the fundamental right to be free from unwanted intrusion into our personal lives. As this Court recognized in Jarvis, at para. 68, “[w]hether a person reasonably expects privacy is necessarily a normative question that is to be answered in light of the norms of conduct in our society” (emphasis in original). Expectations of privacy are contextual and must be assessed in light of the “totality of the circumstances” (R. v. Patrick, 2009 SCC 17, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 579, at para. 26; see also Edwards, at para. 45). Three contextual factors, which are non-exhaustive, may be relevant to this analysis.

[58]                          First, a court may consider the reason why the complainant shared the private information in question. This Court has recognized that a person’s reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to information will vary depending on the purpose for which the information is collected (Dagg v. Canada (Minister of Finance), 1997 CanLII 358 (SCC), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 403, at para. 75). For example, in Quesnelle, this Court accepted that a person may divulge information to an individual or organization with the expectation that it be used only for a specific purpose.

[59]                          Second, the relationship between the complainant and the person with whom the information was shared informs the context. As Wagner C.J. wrote in the context of a complainant’s reasonable expectation of privacy in Jarvis, at para. 29, “[r]elevant considerations may include whether the relationship was one of trust or authority and whether the observation or recording constituted a breach or abuse of the trust or authority that characterized the relationship.” That said, it must be understood that “[t]he circumstances (or nature of the relationship) in which information is shared are not determinative: the reasonable expectation of privacy is not limited to trust-like, confidential, or therapeutic relationships” (Quesnelle, at para. 27). In other words, a relationship of trust is not necessary, but in some cases it may be sufficient, to establish a reasonable expectation of privacy.

[60]                        Third, courts may consider where the record was shared and how it was created or obtained. Records produced in the private domain (e.g., one-on-one communications between the complainant and accused) may attract an enhanced reasonable expectation of privacy; records created or obtained in the public domain, where they could be accessed by multiple people or the general public (e.g., social media or news media), are less likely to attract a reasonable expectation of privacy. That said, the fact that certain information is already available somewhere in the public sphere does not preclude further harm to the privacy interest through additional dissemination that would increase access to the information (Sherman Estate, at para. 81). In other words, there are different degrees of publicity, and in some cases a complainant may have a reasonable interest in preventing information from being disseminated in court proceedings, even if it was not perfectly private before. Similarly, the fact that a record was created or obtained surreptitiously by the accused, without the complainant’s knowledge, would also be relevant as part of the contextual analysis. Such a record would be more likely to attract a reasonable expectation of privacy.

(iii)      Specific Types of Records

1.            Communications

[61]                        Communications form the most contentious type of evidence. Given that “any form of record” is captured under the record screening regime, electronic or non‑electronic communications relating to complainants will fall within the definition of “record” if they contain “personal information for which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy”. Indeed, communications may contain precisely the kind of information Parliament intended to safeguard.

[62]                        Justice Côté in dissent maintains that complainants have no reasonable expectation of privacy in communications with the accused (unless they are in confidential/professional relationships); on the contrary, they should expect the accused to rely on such evidence to defend themselves at trial (para. 463). With respect, we disagree. Complainants should not “lose” their expectation of privacy the moment they step forward to report a sexual offence. The fact that they may have chosen the wrong person to trust should not be determinative of their privacy interest in the context of alleged sexual violence. Our colleague’s approach is antithetical to Parliament’s objective of protecting complainant privacy and dignity during the course of a criminal trial (s. 278.92(3)(g)), as well as the objective of encouraging reporting (s. 278.92(3)(b)). Under our approach, we take into account the trial context while also considering the nature of the communication at the time it took place.

[63]                          As a baseline, to be caught by the record screening regime, the communication must “relat[e] to [the] complainant” in some manner (s. 278.92(1)). The complainant may be the sender or recipient of the communication, or the content of the communication pertains to the complainant.

[64]                          If the communication in question falls within a category of enumerated records, it is unnecessary to inquire further regarding the reasonable expectation of privacy. For example, e-mails exchanged between an accused who is a psychologist and their client regarding therapeutic goals for treatment would properly fall within the definition of s. 278.1 as therapeutic records — a category of enumerated records. If the communication does not fall within an enumerated category, the content‑ and context‑based analysis set out above applies to determine whether the communication contains personal information for which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.

2.            Records of a Sexual Nature (Not Covered by Section 276)

[65]                          One type of non-enumerated record that will often engage a reasonable expectation of privacy is a record of an explicit sexual nature that is not covered by s. 276 (for example, explicit communications, videos or photographs of a sexual nature relating to the subject matter of the charge). Complainants may have a reasonable expectation of privacy in these types of records, given the dignity concerns that can arise.

[66]                          It is helpful to clarify why evidence of an explicit sexual nature that relates to the subject matter of the charge may be caught by the record screening regime even if it is not s. 276 evidence. In addition to creating the record screening regime for private records, Bill C-51 also added s. 276(4), which specifies that sexual activity “includes any communication made for a sexual purpose or whose content is of a sexual nature”. This provision applies to sexual activity other than the sexual activity that forms the subject matter of the charge (s. 276(2)). Any communication regarding such sexual activity would fall within the s. 276 regime.

[67]                          Accordingly, the only records of an explicit sexual nature that could be subject to the record screening regime outside of the s. 276 context would be records pertaining to the complainant, in the possession or control of the accused, that relate to the sexual activity which forms the subject matter of the charge. For clarity, “subject matter of the charge” refers to the components of the actus reus of the specific charge that the Crown must prove at trial. These types of records are likely to engage the complainant’s reasonable expectation of privacy under the content and context framework described above.

(iv)        Summary of the Analytical Process

[68]                          Having defined the scope of “records”, we will now provide an outline of the analytical process that should be applied by a court to determine if evidence constitutes a “record”.

[69]                          The presiding judge should first determine if the proposed evidence contains information that falls under s. 276. If the evidence falls under both ss. 276 and 278.1, as stated above, the judge should assess the evidence as s. 276 evidence.

[70]                          If the proposed evidence does not fall under s. 276, the judge should then determine whether it is a “record” under s. 278.1. If the evidence does not come within one of the enumerated categories, the inquiry should focus on whether it contains personal information for which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. Where the evidence is found to be an enumerated or non-enumerated record, the record screening regime is engaged.

[71]                          A non-enumerated record will be caught by the record screening regime if it contains information of an intimate and highly personal nature that is integral to the complainant’s overall physical, psychological or emotional well-being. Such information will have implications for the complainant’s dignity. This assessment considers the content and context of the record. Electronic communications are subject to this analysis like all forms of records. In addition, records of an explicit sexual nature not covered by s. 276 because they concern the subject matter of the charge will often attract a reasonable expectation of privacy and fall under the record screening regime.

[72]                          When it is unclear whether the evidence is a “record”, counsel should err on the side of caution and initiate Stage One of the record screening process. To be clear, under the record screening regime, the accused will be in possession or control of the evidence at issue, and they will know the context in which the evidence arose. For this reason, the accused will be well equipped to discern whether the evidence is a “record” and to make submissions on this point, if need be.

(3)         Who Do the Impugned Provisions Apply to?

[73]                          Section 278.92(1) states that the record screening regime is intended to apply to records in the accused’s control or possession, which the accused intends to adduce. Accordingly, the Crown is not bound by the record screening regime when seeking to admit private records relating to complainants. Had Parliament intended for the Crown to be bound by the regime, it would have signalled this in the text of ss. 278.92 to 278.94.

[74]                        In so concluding, we recognize that in R. v. Barton, 2019 SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579, this Court held that s. 276(1) applies to the Crown based on the common law principles of Seaboyer, even though s. 276(2) refers only to the accused (para. 80; see also R. v. R.V., 2019 SCC 41, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 237, at para. 78; R. v. Goldfinch, 2019 SCC 38, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 142). But Parliament signalled its intention that the Crown be bound through the text of s. 276(1). As Barton explains, the language of s. 276(1), “which confirms the irrelevance of the ‘twin myths’, is categorical in nature and applies irrespective of which party has led the prior sexual activity evidence” (para. 80). Accordingly, in the context of s. 276 evidence, the Crown remains obliged to bring the equivalent common law application (commonly referred to as a Seaboyer application) where it seeks to introduce evidence of a complainant’s prior sexual history. There is no analogue to s. 276(1) in the record screening regime for private records — throughout, the text refers only to the accused. Unlike in the s. 276 context, the Crown is not required to bring a screening application for private records it seeks to introduce into evidence.

[75]                          Our colleague Brown J. criticizes the fact that the record screening regime applies only to the accused and not the Crown, should the Crown seek to adduce the same records. Leaving aside the statutory language, which is clear on the issue, trial fairness “[does] not guarantee defence counsel the right to precisely the same privileges and procedures as the Crown” (Quesnelle, at para. 64, citing Mills, at para. 111). In our view, such is the case here. These statutory procedures do not apply to the Crown.

(4)         When Is Evidence “Adduced” Such That an Application Is Required?

[76]                        The parties and interveners disagree about the meaning of “adduce” in ss. 278.92(1), 278.93(2) and 278.93(4). The disagreement focuses on whether “adduce” only includes entering evidence as an exhibit at trial, or if it applies as well to the use of the information contained within the record for the purposes of cross-examination. Justice Côté in dissent would adopt the narrow interpretation. In contrast, our interpretation of “adduce” is not limited to circumstances where evidence is entered as an exhibit. Instead, we adopt a purposive approach that includes references to the content of a record made in defence submissions or the examination and cross‑examination of witnesses. Specifically, under the record screening regime, the accused must screen records when they seek to use information during a hearing that they specifically learned from those records. If they have independent knowledge of the information, gathered from sources that do not rely on the complainant’s private records, they may use this information without invoking the record screening regime (subject to other applicable evidentiary rules and trial procedures).

[77]                        We reject the narrow interpretation of “adduce” for several reasons. First, limiting “adduce” to entering an exhibit at trial would create a loophole in the regime, as the accused could simply refer to the evidence in their submissions or cross‑examination. This loophole would not serve to meaningfully protect complainants’ dignity and privacy interests as contemplated by the impugned provisions.

[78]                        Second, a narrow interpretation would not address the concern in Shearing, where the central issue was the accused’s ability to cross-examine the complainant on the contents of her diary, even though he did not enter the diary itself as an exhibit. Since the 2012 Senate Report identified the Shearing situation as one of the motivating factors for its recommendations, it would be illogical to interpret the impugned provisions in a manner that would not address the very situation at issue in that case.

[79]                        Third, the 2012 Senate Report contemplated a broad application for the record screening regime, to account for circumstances where the accused is in possession of a complainant’s records “and wishes to use these records for the purposes of cross-examination or seeks to introduce them into evidence” (p. 19). The accused could use the record to advance groundless myths and stereotypes not just by entering it as an exhibit but, for example, by using it in cross-examination. Parliament intended to include these situations.

[80]                        Finally, the French version of s. 278.92(1) translates “intends to adduce” to “se dispose à présenter en preuve” and points towards a broader interpretation where evidence is presented in the trial proceeding, regardless of whether it is formally entered as an exhibit. Similarly, the term “la preuve” in the French version of ss. 278.93(2) and 278.93(4) refers to evidence broadly and is not limited to exhibits. Had Parliament intended a more narrow interpretation, the statutory language in French or English would have reflected such an intention.

[81]                        In conclusion, the use of the word “adduce” in the impugned provisions captures the content of the record that is referenced by the accused during the trial, even if the record is not formally entered as an exhibit.

(5)         What Is the Appropriate Timing of an Application?

[82]                        There is also disagreement about the timeframe, specified in the record screening regime, in which an application must be provided to the Crown and to the court. More specifically, s. 278.93(4) stipulates the following:

(4) If the judge, provincial court judge or justice is satisfied that the application was made in accordance with subsection (2), that a copy of the application was given to the prosecutor and to the clerk of the court at least seven days previously, or any shorter interval that the judge, provincial court judge or justice may allow in the interests of justice and that the evidence sought to be adduced is capable of being admissible under subsection 276(2), the judge, provincial court judge or justice shall grant the application and hold a hearing under section 278.94 to determine whether the evidence is admissible under subsection 276(2) or 278.92(2).

[83]                        Lower courts have come to different conclusions on whether the word “previously” refers to seven days before the Stage One inquiry, the Stage Two hearing, or the trial. The purpose of the seven-day notice period, as explained in the House of Commons Debates, is to “ensure that all parties have adequate time to prepare” for the application process (vol. 148, No. 195, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., June 15, 2017, at p. 12789 (Marco Mendicino)).

[84]                        Properly interpreted, “previously” refers to the Stage One inquiry where the presiding judge determines whether a Stage Two hearing is necessary. The Crown and clerk of the court must have at least seven days’ notice of the application before it is reviewed by the judge at Stage One. However, s. 278.93(4) states that the judge can exercise their discretion to truncate the notice period in the “interests of justice”.

[85]                        While the statutory language does not specify that these applications must be conducted pre-trial, in our view, this should be the general practice. The encouragement of pre-trial applications in the record screening regime mirrors the approach endorsed previously under the s. 276 regime (see, for example, Goldfinch, at para. 145). There should be consistency between s. 276 evidence applications and private record applications because both now proceed under ss. 278.92 to 278.94.

[86]                        There may be situations that require a trial judge to either revisit a prior admissibility determination under s. 278.92 or to allow a new application mid-trial (see R.V., at para. 75; Barton, at para. 65). Judges maintain this discretion as part of their inherent trial management power. Furthermore, in light of s. 278.93(4), judges have discretion to allow an application to be brought at a shorter interval than seven days before the Stage One hearing when it is in the “interests of justice”. However, as a general rule, private record applications should be brought at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings. There is good reason for this. If mid-trial applications become routine, this would result in frequent adjournments, significant delays, scheduling difficulties ⸺ particularly in jury trials ⸺ and potential unfairness to the accused. Mid‑trial applications could also harm complainants and discourage the reporting and prosecution of sexual offences. One example of where a mid-trial application may be in the “interests of justice” is if the record was only discovered during the course of the trial.

(6)         What Is the Scope of Complainant Participation?

[87]                        Complainant participation is a new procedural component introduced by the impugned provisions, and its scope has not been comprehensively defined by Bill C-51. Accordingly, we look to Parliament’s purpose in enacting Bill C-51 to inform what we consider to be the proper approach.

[88]                        Section 278.94(2) provides that a complainant is “not a compellable witness” at the Stage Two hearing, but may “appear and make submissions”. Section 278.94(3) directs that “[t]he judge shall, as soon as feasible, inform the complainant who participates in the [Stage Two] hearing of their right to be represented by counsel.”

[89]                        Where the presiding judge decides to hold a Stage One oral hearing to determine whether the record is capable of being admissible, the complainant’s participatory rights do not apply. Similarly, the complainant is not entitled to provide written submissions if the Stage One inquiry proceeds only as a written application. Parliament did not incorporate complainants’ participatory rights in s. 278.93 when referring to the Stage One inquiry. Complainants’ participatory rights are specifically attached to Parliament’s use of the word “hearing”, which refers to a Stage Two hearing.

[90]                        The complainant participation provisions, ss. 278.94(2) and 278.94(3), apply to both s. 276 and private record applications. Within the statutory parameters we discuss below, the presiding judge retains significant discretion to determine the appropriate procedure in each case.

(a)           Complainant’s Receipt of Application

[91]                        While the complainant participation provisions do not directly address a complainant’s receipt of the application, it can be reasonably inferred that the complainant must have sufficient knowledge of the record to meaningfully participate in the Stage Two hearing pursuant to s. 278.93(4) (if the presiding judge determines that such a hearing is necessary).

[92]                        Section 278.93(4) provides that the accused must provide a copy of the application to the prosecutor and clerk of the court. When the Crown receives the application prior to the Stage One inquiry, it should provide a general description of the nature of the record and of its relevance to an issue at trial to the complainant and/or the complainant’s counsel. The seven-day notice period prior to Stage One provides the complainant with time to retain counsel in anticipation of the accused’s application being granted under s. 278.93(4). At the same time, only a general description is required at this stage because it is not yet clear whether a Stage Two hearing involving the complainant will be required.

[93]                        If the presiding judge determines that the record is capable of being admissible under Stage One, the Crown should typically disclose the contents of the application to enable the complainant and/or the complainant’s counsel to prepare for the Stage Two hearing. This facilitates the complainant’s meaningful participation. This process is similar to the prior procedure for s. 276 applications in which the Crown had the discretion to consult with the complainant (Darrach, at para. 55).

[94]                        Receipt of the application after the presiding judge determines that the process should continue to Stage Two also allows the complainant to make an informed decision about the extent to which they wish to participate in the Stage Two hearing.

[95]                        A complainant’s receipt of the application where a Stage Two hearing is required is a reflection of one of the components of the audi alteram partem principle: that those who will be affected by a proceeding be informed of the proceeding in addition to having an opportunity to be heard (Telecommunications Workers Union v. Canada (Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission), 1995 CanLII 102 (SCC), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 781, at para. 29; A. (L.L.) v. B. (A.), 1995 CanLII 52 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 536, at para. 27). It would be difficult for a complainant to “appear and make submissions” on the issue of the admissibility of their private records without information about what records are at issue and the purpose for which the accused proposes to adduce them.

[96]                        Importantly, the presiding judge retains the discretion to direct that the application not be disclosed to the complainant or that portions of it be redacted. This may arise based on a party’s or the judge’s own concerns about the impact of disclosure on trial fairness.

(b)         Complainant’s Attendance and Submissions

[97]                        The complainant participation provisions do not specify the extent to which complainants and/or their counsel can participate in the Stage Two hearing. In our view, both can attend the entire Stage Two hearing to facilitate meaningful participation. If there are concerns at the Stage Two hearing that a complainant’s attendance would compromise trial fairness, the judge may, in their discretion, exclude the complainant as required.

[98]                        The provisions also do not specify the scope of complainants’ submissions. In our opinion, subject to the judge’s discretion to ensure trial fairness, meaningful participation allows complainants or their counsel to make oral and written submissions at the Stage Two hearing. There may be circumstances where complainants wish to provide either oral or written submissions, but not both. The presiding judge retains the discretion to permit this.

[99]                        Importantly, a complainant’s right to make submissions does not extend to the trial itself. Complainants’ participatory rights are strictly confined to the Stage Two hearing, and only regarding the admissibility of the evidence which the accused seeks to adduce.

(c)           Complainant’s Ability to Cross-Examine and Lead Evidence

[100]                     There are two reasons why, in our view, complainants do not have the right to cross-examine the accused in the Stage Two hearing, either directly or through counsel. First, the legislation makes no mention of a right to cross-examine. In other parts of the Criminal Code where Parliament has decided to confer a right of cross‑examination, it has done so expressly (see, for example, ss. 117.13(2), 145(10), 347(6), and 672.5(11)).

[101]                     Second, prohibiting cross-examination does not prevent complainants or their counsel from participating meaningfully at the Stage Two hearing. Meaningful participation can occur through complainants’ written or oral submissions. Where it is thought to be necessary to cross-examine the accused at the Stage Two hearing, it is within the sole prerogative of the Crown to do so.

[102]                     Similar principles apply to prevent complainants from leading evidence at the Stage Two hearing. Absent clear statutory language, complainants may not do so. Other Criminal Code provisions expressly grant third parties the right to lead evidence, such as victims in the victim impact statement process (ss. 722(3) and 722(9)). Should complainants have relevant evidence they wish to tender, this can be disclosed to the Crown and presented by the Crown if it so chooses.

(7)         Are Motions for Direction Permitted, and Can Complainants Participate?

[103]                     In light of the uncertainty regarding the scope of records, some defence counsel have on occasion brought a motion for directions before engaging in the procedure under ss. 278.92 to 278.94, to determine whether the particular evidence comes within the definition of a “record” under s. 278.1. Motions for directions are not explicitly contemplated by the statutory language of the record screening regime: they are purely a discretionary exercise of the presiding judge’s trial management power.

[104]                     The test we have articulated for interpreting s. 278.1 is designed to assist counsel and judges in reducing the need for motions for directions. However, in cases where the accused does bring a motion for directions, the presiding judge must decide whether the proposed evidence is a “record”. Where, in the opinion of the judge, the evidence is clearly a “record”, the judge should deal with the matter summarily and order the accused to proceed with a private record application. Equally, where the judge is uncertain whether the proposed evidence is a “record”, they should instruct the accused to proceed with an application. Only if the judge is clearly satisfied that the proposed evidence does not constitute a “record” should they direct that the accused need not bring an application.

[105]                     In deciding the motion for directions, we are of the view that the presiding judge retains the discretion to provide notice to complainants and allow them to participate. This discretion is available to the judge because the motion for directions itself involves an exercise of the trial management power.

(8)         Do Complainants Have Appeal Rights Under the Impugned Provisions?

[106]                     Complainants are only participants at the Stage Two hearing, not parties to the trial proceeding itself. In the vast majority of cases, there will be no further recourse if they are unsatisfied with a decision to admit s. 276 evidence or a private record at trial. Parliament did not contemplate appeal rights for complainants in the statutory language of ss. 278.92 to 278.94.

[107]                     However, complainants do have the ability to appeal a Stage Two hearing decision using the two limited appeal routes that already exist for third party interlocutory appeals in criminal cases: (1) challenging a provincial court order through an application for certiorari in superior court; or (2) seeking leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 40(1) of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26 (A. (L.L.), at para. 24).

[108]                     As with all interlocutory criminal appeals, these appeal routes are extremely limited. Certiorari applications by third parties are limited to jurisdictional errors and errors of law on the face of the record, if the order has a final and conclusive character (R. v. Awashish, 2018 SCC 45, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 87, at para. 12). Since the determination of whether to admit the evidence is a discretionary decision made by the judge, absent exceptional circumstances, complainants are unlikely to succeed on certiorari applications.

[109]                     Leave to appeal to this Court is similarly narrow as an appeal route for complainants. We granted leave to appeal to A.S. in this matter because novel constitutional issues were raised. Interlocutory appeals of criminal matters before this Court, absent clear constitutional issues, are exceedingly rare.

[110]                     Judges must always be mindful of the challenges inherent in interlocutory criminal appeals, having particular regard to the principle of judicial economy, the potential disruption of jury trials, and the risk of running afoul of the accused’s s. 11(b) Charter rights. Accordingly, interlocutory appeals arising out of s. 276 or private record applications should be rare and restricted to clearly exceptional circumstances.

B.            Charter Analysis

[111]                     Having interpreted the relevant provisions, we turn now to their constitutionality. Our constitutional analysis focuses on the new elements introduced by the impugned provisions: the record screening regime and the complainant participation provisions. The constitutionality of the general procedure for s. 276 applications is not before us and was resolved by this Court in Darrach.

[112]                     The respondents J.J. and Mr. Reddick contend that the impugned provisions violate three fundamental rights guaranteed to accused persons under the Charter: the right to silence and privilege against self-incrimination under ss. 7 and 11(c); the right to a fair trial under ss. 7 and 11(d); and the right to make full answer and defence under ss. 7 and 11(d). We begin with the relevant framework under which the Charter analysis must be conducted.

(1)         Analytical Framework

[113]                     In Mills, the Court used s. 7 of the Charter as the governing analytical framework to assess the constitutionality of the third party production regime for complainant records. Similarly, in Darrach, this Court assessed the constitutionality of the s. 276 regime under s. 7 of the Charter. While violations under s. 11 of the Charter were also alleged in these cases, the s. 7 analysis was dispositive. Similarly, in these appeals, ss. 7 and 11(d) are co-extensive with the exception of J.J.’s arguments regarding overbreadth of the record screening regime, which must be properly analyzed under s. 7. Any concerns regarding self-incrimination due to defence disclosure can be addressed through the concepts of full answer and defence and trial fairness rights embodied in the ss. 7 and 11(d) analysis. Concerns about testimonial compulsion fall under s. 11(c), but they pose no problem here because accused persons are not compelled to testify.

[114]                     Our colleagues Brown J. and Rowe J. object to our analytical framework on the basis that s. 11(d) should be analyzed before s. 7, which is more “general”. Our Charter analysis considers the relevance of both ss. 7 and 11(d), which this Court has long recognized are “inextricably intertwined” (Mills, at para. 69, quoting Seaboyer, at p. 603). Following the approach adopted by this Court for decades, we assess these rights together where they are co-extensive and separately where a concern falls specifically under one of the rights (see Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada (Director of Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices Commission), 1990 CanLII 135 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 425, at pp. 536‑38; R. v. L. (D.O.), 1993 CanLII 46 (SCC), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 419, at p. 460; R. v. Levogiannis, 1993 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 475, at p. 494; R. v. Fitzpatrick, 1995 CanLII 44 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 154, at para. 19; Darrach; Mills, at para. 69). Accordingly, we consider the rights to a fair trial and to make full answer and defence separately from overbreadth, which is specifically enshrined as a principle of fundamental justice within s. 7. Moreover, we agree with our colleagues’ assertion that s. 7 should not be used to “limit” the specific guarantees in ss. 8 to 14. Our conclusion that the ss. 7 and 11(d) analysis is co-extensive in these appeals should not be misconstrued as an “internal limiting” of s. 11(d) using s. 7 principles.

[115]                     Further, our approach in these appeals should not be interpreted as a principle of broader application when accused persons raise both ss. 7 and 11(d) in future Charter cases. The appropriate methodology for assessing multiple Charter breaches alleged by the accused may depend on the factual record, the nature of the Charter rights at play, and how they intersect. This Court has repeatedly affirmed that the methodology for assessing multiple alleged Charter breaches is highly context- and fact-specific (R. v. Mentuck, 2001 SCC 76, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 442, at para. 37; M. (A.) v. Ryan, 1997 CanLII 403 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 157, at para. 36; Mills, at para. 63; F. Iacobucci, “‘Reconciling Rights’ The Supreme Court of Canada’s Approach to Competing Charter Rights” (2003), 20 S.C.L.R. (2d) 137, at p. 156).

(2)         Key Principles of Section 7 of the Charter

[116]                     A claimant must follow two analytical steps to establish that a law breaches s. 7 of the Charter: they must demonstrate that (1) the impugned provisions result in the deprivation of life, liberty or security of the person; and that (2) the deprivation violates principles of fundamental justice. These appeals engage both procedural principles of fundamental justice (the rights to a fair trial and to make full answer and defence, and the privilege against self-incrimination) and substantive principles of fundamental justice (overbreadth).

[117]                     As stated in Mills, we accept that the right to liberty in the first stage of the s. 7 analysis is engaged because the accused “faces the possibility of imprisonment” (para. 62). Accordingly, our s. 7 analysis focuses on the second analytical step — the alleged breaches of the principles of fundamental justice.

[118]                     Section 7 requires the principles of fundamental justice to be balanced relationally. The emphasis on an accused’s fair trial rights under s. 7 should be primary (Shearing, at paras. 130-32; Mills, at para. 94; D. Stuart, Charter Justice in Canadian Criminal Law (7th ed. 2018), at pp. 284-86; K. Roach, “The Protection of Innocence Under Section 7 of the Charter” (2006), 34 S.C.L.R. (2d) 249, at pp. 280-81). But the spectrum of interests reflected in the principles of fundamental justice requires a court to avoid viewing any particular principle in isolation from the others (Mills, at para. 73). And “[n]o single principle is absolute and capable of trumping the others; all must be defined in light of competing claims” (Mills, at para. 61).

[119]                     Unlike in Mills, complainants’ s. 8 rights are not engaged in these appeals because the state does not compel production of complainants’ records. However, like in Darrach, the privacy, dignity, and equality interests of complainants are at play in the course of a criminal trial for a sexual offence.

[120]                     In Darrach, this Court further recognized that encouraging the reporting of sexual violence and protecting the security and privacy of witnesses were relevant principles of fundamental justice in the context of protecting complainants in sexual offence trials (para. 25). Elaine Craig explains the uniquely invasive nature of sexual offence trials and the privacy implications that result: “Simply put, sex, and all things related, are socially constructed as deeply private. The impact of an intrusion into the privacy of a sexual offence complainant will often be qualitatively worse than a similar breach with respect to the alleged victim of a fraud or theft, for example” (“Private Records, Sexual Activity Evidence, and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms” (2021), 58 Alta. L. Rev. 773, at pp. 801-2; see also Mills, at para. 91, citing M. (A.), at para. 30). As a result, Darrach adopted a similar approach to Mills, despite the fact that the s. 276 regime was about admissibility of evidence rather than state-compelled production and thus s. 8 was not engaged (paras. 23-24 and 28).

[121]                     Accordingly, our analysis of the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7 adopts the balancing process that was applied in Mills and Darrach. Like s. 11(d), the right to make full answer and defence and the right to a fair trial are considered from the perspectives of the accused, the complainant, the community and the criminal justice system at large (O’Connor, at paras. 193-94, per McLachlin J., as she then was). In this manner, ss. 7 and 11(d) are complementary. As previously mentioned, the framework for analyzing multiple Charter breaches is context- and fact-specific. The Court recently demonstrated the highly context-specific nature of this assessment in R. v. Brown, 2022 SCC 18, at para. 70. In these appeals, the correct approach to “balancing” under s. 7 is similar to Mills and Darrach, due to the nature of the alleged Charter infringements and the highly invasive privacy consequences for complainants that follow directly from their participation in a trial for a sexual offence in open court.

[122]                     This approach is not contrary to this Court’s jurisprudence in Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, 2013 SCC 72, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1101, and Carter v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 5, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 331, which indicate that “competing moral claims and broad societal benefits are more appropriately considered at the stage of justification under s. 1” rather than under s. 7 (Carter, at para. 79). Here, we are not balancing “competing moral claims” but rather assessing the fairness of trial procedures. Nothing in those decisions prohibits the “full appreciation of [the relevant] principles of fundamental justice as they operate within a particular context” (Mills, at para. 63).

(3)         Key Principles of Section 11(d) of the Charter

[123]                     Section 11(d) states that any person charged with an offence has the right “to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal”. The principles of trial fairness and the accused’s right to make a full answer and defence are expressions of procedural principles of fundamental justice under s. 7, and are also embodied in s. 11(d) (R. v. N.S., 2012 SCC 72, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 726, at para. 15; Mills, at para. 69).

[124]                     The key principles of s. 11(d) that apply in the present case are as follows: (1) an individual must be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) the state must bear the burden of proof; and (3) criminal prosecutions must be carried out in accordance with due process (R. v. Oakes, 1986 CanLII 46 (SCC), [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, at p. 121).

[125]                     Section 11(d) does not guarantee “the most favourable procedures imaginable” for the accused, nor is it automatically breached whenever relevant evidence is excluded (Goldfinch, at para. 30; Quesnelle, at para. 64). As this Court affirmed in Darrach, an accused is not “entitled to have procedures crafted that take only [their] interests into account. Still less [are they] entitled to procedures that would distort the truth-seeking function of a trial by permitting irrelevant and prejudicial material at trial” (para. 24). Nor is the broad principle of trial fairness assessed solely from the accused’s perspective. Crucially, as this Court stated in Mills, fairness is also assessed from the point of view of the complainant and community (para. 72, citing R. v. E. (A.W.), 1993 CanLII 65 (SCC), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 155, at p. 198). We now turn to consider the constitutionality of each of the impugned provisions.

(4)         Section 278.92 — Threshold for Admissibility

[126]                     As a preliminary point, we emphasize that the record screening regime clearly does not render essential evidence inadmissible, such as prior inconsistent statements for the purpose of credibility or reliability assessments. Where the balance tips in favour of admitting the evidence because of its significance to the defence, it will be admitted for that purpose. By the same token, the record screening regime prohibits the accused from using the evidence for impermissible, myth-based purposes — just like the s. 276 regime. This is not a novel proposition. Indeed, no evidence can be admitted unless it meets the relevance and materiality thresholds for admissibility (Seaboyer, at p. 609; Goldfinch, at para. 30).

(a)           Section 278.92 Does Not Impair Fair Trial Rights

[127]                     Section 278.92(2)(b) establishes that private records are only admissible if “the evidence is relevant to an issue at trial and has significant probative value that is not substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice”. Similarly, this admissibility threshold is one of the conditions for s. 276 evidence, codified in s. 276(2)(d) (as directed now by s. 278.92(2)(a)) and constitutionally upheld in Darrach.

[128]                     The respondents J.J. and Mr. Reddick argue that the admissibility threshold for private records violates the accused’s right to a fair trial because it impairs their right to make full answer and defence. Specifically, the concern is that the accused will be prevented from adducing relevant and probative evidence in their defence.

[129]                     The record screening regime embodies the fundamental principle governing the law of evidence: “. . . relevant evidence should be admitted, and irrelevant evidence excluded, subject to the qualification that the value of the evidence must outweigh its potential prejudice to the conduct of a fair trial” (Seaboyer, at p. 631). An accused’s right to a fair trial does not include the unqualified right to have all evidence in support of their defence admitted. Many exclusionary rules exist in Canadian criminal law to prevent the Crown or defence from distorting the truth-seeking function of the trial process, which is an integral component of trial fairness (Mills, at para. 74).

[130]                     Moreover, when assessing the prejudicial effect, or the “costs”, of admitting potential evidence, trial judges should consider its effect on all aspects of trial fairness, including “the practicalities of its presentation, the fairness to the parties and to witnesses, and the potentially distorting effect the evidence can have on the outcome of the case” (D. M. Paciocco, P. Paciocco and L. Stuesser, The Law of Evidence (8th ed. 2020), at p. 47 (emphasis added)). In the present context, trial judges must consider the “prejudicial effect” of admitting a record as evidence at trial, which includes the effect on complainants whose private information is implicated.

[131]                     In Darrach, at para. 39, this Court found that the phrase “significant probative value” in the s. 276 context simply requires that the evidence not “be so trifling as to be incapable, in the context of all the evidence, of raising a reasonable doubt”. The Court used language that specified that its analysis on the threshold was specific to s. 276, noting: “In light of the purposes of s. 276, the use of the word ‘significant’ is consistent with both the majority and the minority reasons in Seaboyer” (para. 41 (emphasis added)). However, at para. 26, Darrach recognized the analogous legislative purposes behind the s. 276 regime and the third party production regime, which relies on s. 278.1:

The Court in Mills upheld the constitutionality of the provisions in the Criminal Code that control the use of personal and therapeutic records in trials of sexual offences. The use of these records in evidence is analogous in many ways to the use of evidence of prior sexual activity, and the protections in the Criminal Code surrounding the use of records at trial are motivated by similar policy considerations. [Emphasis added.]

The similarity between the use of s. 276 and s. 278.1 evidence recognized in Darrach supports our view that the admissibility threshold in s. 278.92(2)(b) is constitutional.

[132]                     An important similarity between s. 276 evidence and private records is that they both seek to protect complainants against harmful myths and stereotypes. Specifically, a key purpose of s. 276 is to prevent the accused from adducing evidence that engages the “twin myths” about sexual offence complainants: that complainants are more likely to have consented or are less worthy of belief by reason of past sexual activity that they engaged in (Darrach, at para. 32). While the enumerated records in s. 278.1 do not necessarily engage the twin myths, which relate specifically to prior sexual activity, this Court has recognized that many other problematic myths and stereotypes may be at play — e.g., individuals who consult with mental health professionals are not credible and reliable; failure to immediately report a sexual offence means that it did not occur; drug and alcohol use demonstrates bad character; a “real victim” will avoid all contact with the perpetrator after the fact (Mills, at para. 119; see also R. v. Lavallee, 1990 CanLII 95 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852, at pp. 871-72; R. v. W. (R.), 1992 CanLII 56 (SCC), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122, at p. 134). Our colleague Brown J.’s dissenting reasons focus only on the “twin myths” implicated specifically by s. 276 evidence; they fail to meaningfully recognize the risks posed by other myths, including those listed above.

[133]                     In sum, the right to make full answer and defence will only be violated if the accused is prevented from adducing relevant and material evidence, the probative value of which is not outweighed by its prejudicial effect. Section 278.92 does no such thing. With respect to private record applications, the admissibility threshold in s. 278.92(2)(b) and the factors in s. 278.92(3) require the judge to weigh the potential prejudice arising from the proposed evidence, including whether it is myth-based or unjustifiably intrusive on a complainant’s privacy, against the extent of its probative value. It follows, in our view, that the admissibility threshold in s. 278.92(2) does not breach ss. 7 or 11(d) of the Charter.

(b)         Section 278.92 Procedure Is Not Overbroad

[134]                     The respondent J.J. argues that s. 278.92 violates the accused’s rights under s. 7 of the Charter because it is overbroad. Specifically, he says that the record screening regime forces the accused to disclose a wide range of records to the Crown and the complainant, going beyond what is necessary to accomplish Parliament’s objectives. Furthermore, in Mr. Reddick’s case, the application judge concluded that s. 278.92 was overbroad because it subjected all “records” under s. 278.1 to the record screening regime, even if the records would not perpetuate myths and stereotypes about sexual offence complainants (paras. 43-49 and 77).

[135]                     To be clear, the constitutionality of the definition of “record” set out in s. 278.1 is not in issue. The concern is the application of the definition in the context of the record screening regime in s. 278.92 — specifically, with respect to the resulting impacts on self-incrimination and cross-examination.

[136]                     It is a principle of fundamental justice that a law cannot be overbroad. A law is overbroad when it is “so broad in scope that it includes some conduct that bears no relation to its purpose” (Bedford, at para. 112 (emphasis in original)). For an impugned provision to be overbroad, there must be “no rational connection between the purposes of the law and some, but not all, of its impacts” (Bedford, at para. 112 (emphasis in original)).

[137]                     Overbreadth must be understood relative to the legislative purpose, which can be discerned from three factors: (1) statements of purpose in the legislation; (2) the text, context and scheme of the legislation; and (3) extrinsic evidence, such as legislative history and evolution (R. v. Safarzadeh-Markhali, 2016 SCC 14, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 180, at para. 31, citing R. v. Moriarity, 2015 SCC 55, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 485, at para. 31). The “appropriateness” of the legislative purpose has no place in this inquiry, and this Court must start from the presumption that the legislation is appropriate and lawful (Safarzadeh-Markhali, at para. 29, citing Moriarity, at para. 30).

[138]                     We have already discussed these factors in extensive detail above, so we will not duplicate the analysis here. However, we note that the relevant factors for discerning the purpose of the provisions are the following. First, the legislative history demonstrates that the record screening regime was intended to fill a legislative gap to ensure statutory protection of complainants’ privacy and dignity, where the accused is in possession or control of their highly private records. Second, the legislative text and scheme — including the specification of “personal information for which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy” and the factors set out in s. 278.92(3) — provides further guidance on the relevant objectives.

[139]                     Taking these factors into account, we conclude that Parliament enacted this regime with a view to (1) protecting the dignity, equality, and privacy interests of complainants; (2) recognizing the prevalence of sexual violence in order to promote society’s interest in encouraging victims of sexual offences to come forward and seek treatment; and (3) promoting the truth-seeking function of trials, including by screening out prejudicial myths and stereotypes. Section 278.92 is not overbroad relative to this legislative purpose because it does not go further than is reasonably necessary to achieve these three goals (Safarzadeh-Markhali, at para. 50).

[140]                     The definition of “record” will only capture materials that come within the enumerated categories, or that otherwise contain information of an intimate and highly personal nature that is integral to the complainant’s overall physical, psychological, or emotional well-being. Screening records that meet this definition is rationally connected to Parliament’s objective of protecting the privacy and dignity interests of complainants. This narrow definition does not include evidence that does not have implications for complainants’ dignity — for example, communications containing scheduling matters.

[141]                     Of course, there will be cases where it is unclear whether evidence falls into the definition of “record”. But this, alone, does not render the regime overbroad. It is important to emphasize that just because a record is subject to screening does not mean it will be excluded at trial. Records that meet the admissibility threshold can be adduced at trial. Further, requiring an accused to bring an application to adduce materials that might contain information of an intimate and highly personal nature is consistent with the objective of the regime, since it respects both the accused’s fair trial rights and the complainant’s privacy and equality interests.

[142]                     Protecting complainants’ privacy rights in such circumstances requires a preventative approach, that is, an approach that guards complainants’ reasonable expectation of privacy at the point of admission. As this Court observed in O’Connor, once privacy is invaded, “it can seldom be regained” (para. 119). It is necessary to determine the nature and gravity of what is at stake before it is adduced at trial. The requirement on accused persons to disclose these records in advance — even where it is unclear to what extent the evidence would have a bearing on complainants’ dignity — is still rationally connected to the overarching objective of the regime.

[143]                     While it is possible that not every record tendered in practice will fall neatly within this definition, Parliament was alive to this concern and enacted several procedural safeguards to ensure that any resulting impact was not divorced from the law’s broader objective. These include, as discussed above, judges’ discretionary ability to limit the disclosure of applications to complainants before hearings, as well as the ability to hold mid-trial applications where necessary in the interests of justice. Where there is ambiguity regarding the application of the record screening regime, these discretionary aspects of the procedure ensure that any impact on the accused’s rights is consistent with Parliament’s objective.

(5)         Section 278.93 — Stage One Application to Hold Hearing

(a)           General Principles: The Right to Silence and the Principle Against Self-Incrimination

[144]                     The principle against self-incrimination imposes limits on the extent to which an accused can be used as a source of information about his or her own criminal conduct (R. v. S.A.B., 2003 SCC 60, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 678, at para. 33). The right to silence is closely entwined with the principle against self-incrimination (R. v. White, 1999 CanLII 689 (SCC), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 417, at para. 44). As this Court explained in R. v. Henry, 2005 SCC 76, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 609, at para. 2, the right to “stand silent before the accusations of the state” is “intimately linked to our adversarial system of criminal justice and the presumption of innocence”. Both preserve the “basic tenet of justice” that the Crown must establish a case to meet before the accused is expected to respond (R. v. P. (M.B.), 1994 CanLII 125 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 555, at p. 579).

[145]                     The principle against self-incrimination is manifested in several specific constitutional and common law rules that apply both before and during trial. Before trial, the law protects an accused from being conscripted into assisting their own prosecution. It does so through the confessions rule, the right to remain silent when questioned by state agents, and the absence of a general duty to disclose (P. (M.B.), at p. 578; R. v. Singh, 2007 SCC 48, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 405, at para. 21). During the conduct of a trial, the principle against self-incrimination is reflected in (1) the s. 11(c) prohibition against testimonial compulsion; (2) the s. 11(d) presumption of innocence and the burden on the Crown to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt; and (3) the s. 13 protection against self-incrimination in other proceedings.

[146]                     Residual protection against self-incrimination is also provided under s. 7 of the Charter (P. (M.B.), at p. 577). The residual s. 7 protection, however, is context‑dependent and does not provide “absolute protection” against “all uses of information that has been compelled by statute or otherwise” (White, at para. 45); nor should one “automatically accept that s. 7 comprises a broad right against self‑incrimination on an abstract level” (Thomson Newspapers, at p. 538).

[147]                     Together, these rights inform the underlying principle “that it is up to the state, with its greater resources, to investigate and prove its own case, and that the individual should not be conscripted into helping the state fulfil this task” (P. (M.B.), at p. 579).

[148]                     The parties and interveners in this case have raised the specific issues of testimonial compulsion and “defence disclosure” in support of their contention that the record screening regime violates the principle against self-incrimination. We would not give effect to these arguments for the following reasons.

(b)         No Self-Incrimination Under Section 11(c) Due to Testimonial Compulsion

[149]                     We first turn to s. 11(c) of the Charter, which guarantees that “[a]ny person charged with an offence has the right . . . not to be compelled to be a witness in proceedings against that person in respect of the offence”. This right is limited to testimonial compulsion and applies only where a person is (1) compelled to be a witness (2) in proceedings against that person (3) in respect of the offence (Martineau v. M.N.R., 2004 SCC 81, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 737, at para. 68). It does not apply to protect against the disclosure of physical evidence (R. v. Beare, 1988 CanLII 126 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 387), including documentary evidence that is not created due to state compulsion (R. v. Anderson (2002), 57 O.R. (3d) 671 (C.A.), at paras. 17-18).

[150]                     The record screening regime places no burden on the accused to submit an affidavit and undergo cross-examination. If an affidavit is submitted in support of the application, “[i]t need not be the accused [themselves] who presents evidence; it can be anyone with relevant information who can personally testify to its truth” (Darrach, at para. 53). Nor does it require the accused to testify. The accused is simply not compelled to be a witness within the meaning of s. 11(c) by the operation of ss. 278.92 to 278.94.

(c)           No Defence Disclosure Undermining Right to a Fair Trial

[151]                     Continuing on to ss. 7 and 11(d), the record screening regime does not require compelled “defence disclosure” in a manner that would violate an accused’s right to a fair trial.

[152]                     Section 278.93 requires that an accused bring an application setting out detailed particulars of the evidence they seek to adduce and its relevance to the case. The respondent J.J. submits that this, in effect, compels the defence to disclose evidence and reveal its strategy. He submits that this runs afoul of the principle that an accused has no disclosure obligations. This principle, in J.J.’s view, flows from the related principles of the right to silence, the presumption of innocence, and the right against self-incrimination. The respondent J.J. and the intervener the Criminal Trial Lawyers’ Association (“CTLA”) both submit that the record screening regime violates the principle against defence disclosure, therefore forcing defendants to self-incriminate. We would not give effect to this argument.

[153]                     To be clear, this concern is separate from the argument about full answer and defence, in which the predominant concern is that disclosure of evidence to a complainant will impede effective cross-examination. Here, the argument is that it is inappropriate to require the defence to disclose its case to the Crown, regardless of any subsequent disclosure to witnesses.

(i)            The Right to Silence Does Not Entail an Absolute Rule Against “Defence Disclosure”

[154]                     There is no absolute rule against requiring the defence to disclose evidence to the Crown before the prosecution closes its case.

[155]                     The respondent J.J. and the intervener CTLA cite Cory J.’s comment in R. v. Chambers, 1990 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1293, that “[a]s a general rule there is no obligation resting upon an accused person to disclose either the defence which will be presented or the details of that defence before the Crown has completed its case” (p. 1319). They also rely on this Court’s comment in R. v. Stinchcombe, 1991 CanLII 45 (SCC), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, that “the defence has no obligation to assist the prosecution and is entitled to assume a purely adversarial role toward the prosecution” (p. 333).

[156]                     We do not agree that these statements, read in their proper context, establish a general rule against defence disclosure. In Chambers, the Court held that an accused is entitled to remain silent in the face of questioning by police officers, and that it is inappropriate for the Crown to ask the trier of fact to draw an adverse inference against an accused who exercises this right. This does not support J.J. and CTLA’s position that there is a general rule against “defence disclosure”. Understood properly, it means that where there is no disclosure required, the trier of fact cannot draw an adverse inference from the defence choosing not to disclose. It does not stand for the proposition that the defence can never be required to disclose its theory or the evidence in support of it before the Crown has closed its case.

[157]                     Furthermore, Stinchcombe did not close the door on the possibility of defence disclosure. The Court commented that a duty on the defence to disclose evidence — reciprocal to the duty of the Crown — “may deserve consideration by this Court in the future” (p. 333). The Court clearly did not contemplate the absolute rule against defence disclosure which J.J. and CTLA espouse.

[158]                     There are many examples in the criminal trial process where the defence is required to disclose aspects of its defence theory and evidence in support of it. For example, if the defence wishes to adduce evidence of an alibi, it must provide advance disclosure to the Crown in “a timely way”, and the disclosure must be “sufficiently particular to enable the authorities to meaningfully investigate” (R. v. Tomlinson, 2014 ONCA 158, 307 C.C.C. (3d) 36, at para. 121). Where the defence fails to provide timely and sufficient notice (which will typically be before trial), the trier of fact “may draw an adverse inference” when assessing the worth of the alibi (Tomlinson, at para. 122).

[159]                     In addition, if an accused wants to lead evidence of a deceased victim’s propensity for violence, they must bring a Scopelliti application. A screening procedure for this type of evidence is permitted because it “is likely to arouse feelings of hostility against the [victim]” (R. v. Scopelliti (1981), 1981 CanLII 1787 (ON CA), 34 O.R. (2d) 524 (C.A.), at pp. 538-39). As such, “there must inevitably be some element of discretion in the determination whether the proffered evidence has sufficient probative value for the purpose for which it is tendered to justify its admission” (Scopelliti, at p. 539).

[160]                     Finally, evidence of complainants’ prior sexual history must be screened before it can be admitted under s. 276. Parliament required this process because such evidence may mislead the trier of fact by invoking discredited myths about the credibility of sexual offence complainants, thus distorting the truth-seeking function of the trial (see Darrach, at paras. 21, 32, 35 and 42). All three of these screening mechanisms are permitted because of the potential prejudice that could result from the admission of the evidence.

[161]                     The respondent J.J. contends that the record screening regime applies to a broader range of evidence than the examples discussed above. Further, he argues that the logic underlying the record screening regime could apply to all defence evidence, which could mean the defence may be required to disclose its entire case.

[162]                     We do not accept this “slippery slope” argument. The record screening regime does not apply to all defence evidence; it is specifically tied to the legislative purpose of protecting complainants’ highly private records in sexual offence trials. Like the former s. 276 regime, s. 278.92 screening in the context of private record applications applies to a narrow set of evidence that implicates important interests of complainants in sexual offence cases and has the potential to create serious prejudice. Private records are analogous to s. 276 evidence, as they can also implicate myths that are insidious and inimical to the truth-seeking function of the trial (Darrach, at paras. 26 and 28). Like s. 276 evidence, private records encroach on the privacy and dignity of complainants. They too require screening to ensure trial fairness under ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter.

[163]                     In sum, to encourage the reporting of sexual offences and promote the truth-seeking function of a trial, the record screening regime is designed to catch records which both implicate complainants’ privacy and dignity in sexual offence cases and which have the potential to engage truth-distorting myths. Interpreted properly, the class of records subject to screening is tailored to Parliament’s objective, and the logic underlying the record screening regime does not apply more broadly to other types of defence evidence. It is permissible to require screening of this evidence because of the potential prejudice that could result from its admission.

(ii)         The P. (M.B.) Concern About Crown Advantage Does Not Apply

[164]                     The respondent J.J. and the intervener CTLA have also raised a related concern that, under the record screening regime, the Crown is given notice of the defence theory and the evidence in support of it, which the Crown can then use to improve its case in advance of trial. In this way, the accused is conscripted into assisting in their own prosecution. To support this argument, J.J. and CTLA rely on P. (M.B.), in which this Court discussed the dangers of allowing the Crown to reopen its case after an accused has embarked on their defence.

[165]                     In P. (M.B.), the Court held that “the Crown should not, as a general rule, be permitted to reopen [its case] once the defence has started to answer the Crown’s case” (p. 580). The rationale for this general rule is as follows:

What is so objectionable about allowing the Crown’s case to be reopened after the defence has started to meet that case is that it jeopardizes, indirectly, the principle that an accused not be conscripted against him- or herself. . . . [T]here is a real risk that the Crown will, based on what it has heard from the defence once it is compelled to “meet the case” against it, seek to fill in gaps or correct mistakes in the case which it had on closing and to which the defence has started to respond. [Emphasis in original; pp. 579-80.]

The respondent J.J. and the intervener CTLA submit that the record screening regime raises similar concerns to those identified in P. (M.B.). Specifically, the regime requires the defence to disclose some evidence, which the Crown can use to “fill in gaps or correct mistakes” in its case. This, they say, constitutes self-incrimination as contemplated in P. (M.B.).

[166]                     In our view, J.J. and CTLA have taken P. (M.B.) out of context. The Court in that case discussed the specific concerns arising from the Crown reopening its case after the defence had started to give evidence at trial. At that point, the Crown is not permitted to correct its own error or omission — “enough is enough” (P. (M.B.), at p. 580). Once the Crown has closed its case, it generally cannot move the goalposts after the accused has embarked on their defence (see R. v. G. (S.G.), 1997 CanLII 311 (SCC), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 716, at para. 38). As such, the trial judge’s discretion to allow the Crown to reopen its case is very much constrained.

[167]                     The “ambit” of that discretion also falls on a scale: it “becomes narrower as the trial proceeds because of the increasing likelihood of prejudice to the accused’s defence as the trial progresses” (G. (S.G.), at para. 30). The trial judge has broad discretion before the Crown has closed its case; more limited discretion after the Crown has closed but before the defence has elected whether or not to call evidence; and extremely narrow discretion once the defence has already begun to answer the Crown’s case (G. (S.G.), at para. 30).

[168]                     These concerns from P. (M.B.) and G. (S.G.) do not arise in the context of private record applications. The record screening process generally takes place before trial, well before the Crown has begun — let alone finished — making its case. Following the logic of G. (S.G.), at this juncture, the likelihood of prejudice to the accused is at the lower end of the scale. We considered these authorities bearing in mind the context in which they were decided — i.e. the Crown was reopening its case — instead of considering them to be abstract and undefined statements of principle relating to the pre-trial screening of evidence.

[169]                     While an application must disclose the evidence at issue and its relevance to the case, this is not tantamount to revealing the entire defence theory in response to which the Crown could, hypothetically, tailor its prosecution. The application process is limited to the admissibility of the highly private records sought to be adduced. The guilt or innocence of the accused is not at issue in the record screening regime; the proceedings relate solely to the admissibility of a particular class of evidence sought to be adduced by the accused. The risk of the Crown co-opting this evidence to strengthen its case is accordingly limited. As such, the defence cannot be said to be assisting the Crown’s prosecution.

[170]                     In conclusion, we are satisfied that s. 278.93 is constitutional under ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter. First, the accused is not compelled to testify and, therefore, s. 11(c) of the Charter is not engaged. Second, there is no absolute rule against defence disclosure. The screening of private records is appropriate because the evidence has a high potential for prejudice; it does not constitute a disguised form of self-incrimination.

(6)         Section 278.94 — Stage Two Hearing Procedure

[171]                     Section 278.94 governs the procedure for the Stage Two hearing. The regime provides for complainant participation in s. 278.94(2) and (3). Section 278.94(2) permits complainants to appear and make submissions, and s. 278.94(3) stipulates that judges must, as soon as feasible, inform complainants who participate in the hearing of their right to be represented by counsel.

[172]                     The respondent Mr. Reddick submits that these provisions violate the accused’s fair trial rights protected by ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter. In particular, he argues that (1) accused persons will be deprived of relevant information regarding complainants’ initial reaction to the proposed evidence, thereby violating their right to make full answer and defence; (2) prosecutorial independence will be jeopardized by adding an additional adversary against the accused; and (3) complainants will tailor their evidence at trial in response to the application. For the reasons that follow, we would not give effect to these submissions.

(a)         No Deprivation of Relevant Evidence

[173]                     As discussed above, if the judge determines that a Stage Two hearing is required, complainants must be informed of the relevant information in the application to enable their meaningful participation. Mr. Reddick argues that complainants’ receipt of this information through counsel will deprive the defence of relevant Crown disclosure. The argument assumes that the complainant will be provided with information about the contents of the application in the absence of the Crown (i.e. the defence will send the application to the complainant’s counsel directly). Therefore, the accused will be deprived of Crown disclosure about the complainant’s “initial reaction” to the application, including their emotional responses.

[174]                     There is no statutory support for the assumption that the application will be sent directly to complainants without the involvement of the Crown. The legislation is silent about complainants’ entitlement to receive the application. Consistent with the former practice under s. 276, the Crown is responsible for consulting complainants regarding the application. Therefore, there is no change from the s. 276 regime. Accused persons have not “lost” any Crown disclosure to which they were originally entitled. Moreover, complainants have always had the ability to consult counsel regarding s. 276 evidence applications.

[175]                     In any event, Mr. Reddick has not given any reason to believe that “initial reaction” evidence of complainants’ emotional state is inherently valuable, outside of myth-based reasoning that relies on the stereotype that there is only one “appropriate reaction” to the disclosure of private information. Of course, if any new relevant information arises during the Crown’s consultation with a complainant, then it has a duty to disclose this information to the accused. The provisions granting participatory rights to complainants have not in any way altered the Crown’s Stinchcombe obligations.

(b)         No Impact on Prosecutorial Independence

[176]                     Mr. Reddick argues that a complainant’s participation in the Stage Two hearing violates the right to a fair trial because it disrupts the general structure of a criminal trial as a bipartite proceeding between the Crown and the accused. Mr. Reddick also argues that the participation of complainants and their counsel interferes with prosecutorial independence. We disagree.

[177]                     Complainant’s participation is justified because they have a direct interest in whether their records, for which they have a reasonable expectation of privacy, are adduced in open court. In A. (L.L.), L’Heureux-Dubé J. (writing for the majority on this point) found that a sexual assault complainant had standing to appeal a decision regarding the production to the accused of her private records in the hands of a third party (either through certiorari with respect to provincial court orders or through s. 40 of the Supreme Court Act for superior court orders, both of which were discussed above in paras. 111-12). She found that complainants had a “direct and necessary interest in making representations” and would be “directly affected by a decision regarding the production of [their] private records” (para. 28). That reasoning applies equally in this context and underlies complainants’ standing to participate in the admissibility hearing.

[178]                     This limited standing on the issue of admissibility, however, does not turn complainants or their counsel into parties, much less quasi-prosecutors, usurping the role of the Crown. Participation by complainants does not change the bipartite nature of the criminal trial. There is no issue of a complainant acting as a “second prosecutor” on the ultimate issue of guilt where, as here, the complainant has no participatory rights in the trial itself. As this Court noted at para. 66 of Darrach, the purpose of an evidentiary voir dire is not to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused. Instead, the complainant is bringing their unique perspective on the impact that the admission of the evidence will have on their privacy and dignity, which is directly relevant to the issue of admissibility. The presiding judge remains the final arbiter on admissibility and is entitled to accept or reject the complainant’s submissions and weigh them against the competing considerations.

[179]                     An important justification for complainants’ participation is that they have a unique perspective on the nature of the privacy interest at stake in their own records. Far from becoming a “second prosecutor”, a complainant’s contributions are valuable exactly because they are different from the Crown’s. This may also strengthen the appearance of prosecutorial independence because the Crown no longer bears the burden of representing or conveying to the judge the complainant’s perspective on whether the records should be admitted. This is especially significant where the complainant and Crown differ on the issue of admissibility.

[180]                     There are other situations in which third parties are permitted to participate in criminal trials where they have interests at stake. For example, victims providing victim impact statements at sentencing hearings or media participants making submissions regarding publication bans both have participatory rights in the courtroom. These participatory rights do not distort the bipartite nature of the criminal proceeding.

(c)           No Violation of the Right to Cross-Examine

[181]                     As explained above, complainants will receive information about the application from the Crown in order to facilitate their participation in the hearing. Given that most applications should be made before trial, complainants will generally receive this information before they testify. Section 278.94 also confers participation rights at the Stage Two hearing, which allows complainants to hear the defence’s oral arguments regarding relevance and probative value of the evidence (unless the judge decides that some exclusion is necessary to protect trial fairness).

[182]                     Both J.J. and Mr. Reddick submit that a complainant’s knowledge of the evidence in the application, as well as the defence theory as to why it is relevant, will impair the defence’s right to cross-examine without significant and unwarranted restraint. They submit that by participating in the Stage Two hearing, complainants will be able to tailor their responses in cross-examination at trial to explain away discrepancies and diminish the impact of the defence’s line of questioning. Since credibility and reliability will often be central to the trial of a sexual offence, complainant participation violates the accused’s right to make full answer and defence. We disagree with this submission for several reasons.

[183]                     First, the right to cross-examine is not unlimited. The accused is not entitled to proceed with an unfair or irrelevant cross-examination only because they consider it to be their most effective strategy. This is both unfair to complainants and contrary to the interests of justice. In Osolin, L’Heureux-Dubé J., dissenting, but not on this point, noted that “[t]he rights of the accused to both adduce evidence and cross-examine are not unlimited but must be first, circumscribed by the question of relevance and second, balanced by countervailing factors such as the privacy interests of the witness and the prejudice to both the witness and the trial process” (pp. 631-32). In this case, ambushing complainants with their own highly private records at trial can be unfair to complainants and may be contrary to the search for truth.

[184]                     Ultimately, the right to a fair trial does not guarantee “the most advantageous trial possible from the accused’s perspective” nor does it guarantee “perfect justice” (R. v. Find, 2001 SCC 32, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 863, at para. 28; see also O’Connor, at para. 193). Rather, the guarantee is fundamentally fair justice, which requires consideration of the privacy interests of others involved in the justice system (O’Connor, at paras. 193-94, per McLachlin J.). Even if it would be ideal from the accused’s perspective to cross-examine complainants on “every scintilla” of information in an attempt to discredit or shake them, the Charter guarantees no such right (O’Connor, at paras. 193-94). In the present case, the impugned provisions strike a balance that protects fundamental justice for accused persons and complainants.

[185]                     Second, it is incorrect to assume that advanced disclosure prevents effective cross-examination or impairs the search for truth. Accused persons receive extensive disclosure from the Crown, yet there is no assumption that their testimony is less reliable or credible as a result. Indeed, this Court in Stinchcombe soundly rejected this suggestion:

Refusal to disclose is also justified on the ground that the material will be used to enable the defence to tailor its evidence to conform with information in the Crown’s possession. For example, a witness may change his or her testimony to conform with a previous statement given to the police or counsel for the Crown. I am not impressed with this submission. All forms of discovery are subject to this criticism. There is surely nothing wrong in a witness refreshing his or her memory from a previous statement or document. The witness may even change his or her evidence as a result. This may rob the cross-examiner of a substantial advantage but fairness to the witness may require that a trap not be laid by allowing the witness to testify without the benefit of seeing contradictory writings which the prosecutor holds close to the vest. The principle has been accepted that the search for truth is advanced rather than retarded by disclosure of all relevant material. [Emphasis added; p. 335.]

Therefore, contrary to the submission of J.J. and Mr. Reddick, there is no absolute principle that disclosure of defence materials inevitably impairs cross-examination and trial fairness.

[186]                     In civil proceedings, both parties participate in extensive pre-trial discovery and disclosure of documents and witnesses, without raising the issue of “witness tainting”. Although surprise was historically a “weapo[n] in the arsenal” of adversarial trials in general, its decline has resulted from the acceptance of the principle that “justice was better served when the element of surprise was eliminated from the trial and the parties were prepared to address issues on the basis of complete information of the case to be met” (Stinchcombe, at p. 332). This Court applied that principle in Darrach, holding that “[t]he right to make full answer and defence does not include the right to defend by ambush” (para. 55). Similarly, in the third party production regime, complainants receive a copy of the production application and have the ability to participate in the hearing concerning the likely relevance of that evidence in advance of cross-examination.

[187]                     “Witness tainting” is not a concern that precludes effective cross‑examination with respect to Crown disclosure in criminal trials or civil proceedings. For the same reasons, complainant participation in a Stage Two hearing does not create a risk of “witness tainting” that impermissibly impairs the search for truth or the effectiveness of cross-examination. Providing advance notice to complainants that they may be confronted with highly private information in open court is likely to enhance their ability to participate honestly in cross-examination. Specifically, they are likely to be better equipped to respond rather than being blindsided with the use of their private records. In addition, the requirement that an application be disclosed in advance of trial ensures that sexual offence complainants are informed about the implications of participating in the trial process (Craig, at pp. 808-9; R. v. M.S., 2019 ONCJ 670, at para. 92 (CanLII)). This in turn promotes just and fair trials.

[188]                     Third, the accused will still be able to test a complainant’s evidence by comparing it to prior statements made to the police. These statements are available to the defence under the Crown’s Stinchcombe obligations. If the complainant’s evidence has changed significantly between the police statement and the trial, this will be readily apparent to the trier of fact, and the accused will be able to cross-examine on that basis (whether or not the police statement was made under oath) (see Craig). Triers of fact can assess whether they believe the complainant and adjust the weight they give to the complainant’s evidence.

[189]                     Fourth, complainants can be cross-examined on their access to the private record application. The accused can impugn the credibility and reliability of the complainant by suggesting that they tailored their evidence to fit what they learned in the application. To the extent that our colleague Brown J. suggests that ss. 645(5) and 648 of the Criminal Code render such cross-examination impermissible, we disagree.

[190]                     Finally, s. 278.93(4) provides judges with the discretion to hear applications at a shorter interval than seven days before the hearing if it is in the “interests of justice”. Trial judges also have the discretion to hear an application mid‑trial in the interests of justice. The respondents J.J. and Mr. Reddick are concerned about “witness tainting” because complainants generally receive the application and participate in the Stage Two admissibility hearing before they take the stand at trial. However, if there is a situation where advanced disclosure of the application to a complainant would genuinely negate the efficacy of cross-examination, the accused may choose to bring the application during cross-examination to avoid the risk of “witness tainting”. The trial judge is then responsible for determining whether it is in the interests of justice to allow such an application. In doing so, trial judges should be mindful of the trial delay risks that will arise due to the bifurcation of trial. To be clear, mid-trial applications should not be the norm.

(7)         Final Conclusions Regarding Constitutionality

[191]                     In the absence of a finding that ss. 278.92 to 278.94 of the Criminal Code breach either ss. 7 or 11(d) of the Charter, it is unnecessary for us to canvass s. 1 of the Charter. And as discussed earlier, there are no s. 11(c) issues at play.

V.           Disposition

[192]                     Sections 278.92 to 278.94 of the Criminal Code are constitutional in their entirety, as they apply to both s. 276 evidence applications and private record applications.

[193]                     Accordingly, we would allow the Crown’s appeal and dismiss J.J.’s cross-appeal; we would also allow A.S.’s appeal. The application judges’ constitutional rulings in both matters are hereby quashed.

VI.         Costs

[194]                     In J.J.’s case, there will be no order as to costs, whether with respect to the Crown’s appeal or to J.J.’s cross-appeal, as this is a criminal matter without exceptional circumstances.

[195]                     In the other appeal, A.S. brought a motion to appoint counsel pursuant to s. 694.1 of the Criminal Code. Section 694.1 does not contemplate appointments of counsel for parties other than accused individuals and, accordingly, A.S.’s motion must be denied.

[196]                     However, A.S. provided an important perspective before this Court on behalf of complainants on a novel constitutional question at her own expense. Pursuant to this Court’s costs jurisdiction under s. 47 of the Supreme Court Act, we exercise our discretion in these exceptional circumstances to order the Attorney General of Ontario to pay A.S.’s costs before this Court. As such, A.S.’s appeal is allowed with costs to A.S. in this Court, in accordance with the tariff of fees and disbursements set out in Schedule B of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada, SOR/2002-156.

 

The following are the reasons delivered by

 

                  Brown J. —

I.               Introduction

[197]                     In R. v. Seaboyer, 1991 CanLII 76 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at p. 625, this Court held that Parliament, in rightly seeking to abolish the “outmoded, sexist‑based use” of evidence of a complainant’s prior sexual activity, “oversho[t] the mark” by rendering inadmissible “evidence which may be essential to the presentation of legitimate defences and hence to a fair trial”. In so doing, the Court added, Parliament created “the real risk that an innocent person may be convicted” (p. 625).

[198]                     These appeals arise from a measure that also imposes precisely that risk. The records screening regime enacted under ss. 278.92 to 278.94 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, represents an unprecedented and unconstitutional erosion by Parliament of the fair trial rights of the presumptively innocent ⸺ who, it should be borne in mind, will sometimes be actually innocent. It seriously impedes the ability of such persons to prove that innocence, by making presumptively inadmissible all private records relating to the complainant that are in the possession of the accused and which the accused intends to adduce in a sexual offence prosecution. It is the only evidentiary rule that mandates pre‑trial disclosure of defence evidence and strategy, before the Crown has made out a case to meet, and even where the evidence sought to be relied on is neither irrelevant nor inherently prejudicial. 

[199]                     In upholding this regime as constitutional, the majority points reassuringly to supposed “similarities” between the records screening regime and two related statutory schemes: s. 276’s provisions restricting admissibility of other sexual activity evidence ⸺ initially struck down in Seaboyer but then narrowed by Parliament and upheld in R. v. Darrach, 2000 SCC 46, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 443; and ss. 278.1 to 278.91’s framework for production of third‑party records ⸺ upheld in R. v. Mills, 1999 CanLII 637 (SCC), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 668. Since the accused’s right to full answer and defence and the rule against defence disclosure are not absolute, the logic goes, Parliament can go even further in departing from them. The majority’s analysis is thus reducible to a simple syllogism: (1) these rights are not absolute and have been limited in similar ways; (2) those limits were judged constitutional; (3) therefore, this new limit is constitutional.

[200]                     But casting these two schemes as “similar” miscasts both them and our jurisprudence. The majority fails to account for the actual mechanics and effects of the records screening regime. It is broader in its purpose, scope, and impact on the accused’s rights. It goes further than s. 276 and ss. 278.1 to 278.91 by giving the complainant a right to advance notice and to “appear and make submissions”, and applies to a wider range of records, many of which will often be highly relevant and probative. It is not limited to materials that were created in a confidential context or wrongly fell into the accused’s hands, such as a complainant’s psychiatric report. And, crucially, it also captures the accused’s own digital communications with the complainant about the subject matter of the charge ⸺ including, but not limited to, messages in which the complainant denies the offence ever occurred, indicates a motive to fabricate, suggests an inability to remember core events, or provides an inconsistent version of the alleged incident. That is a difference in kind, not in degree.

[201]                     In short, and in a field which calls for a context‑specific analysis, the majority cannot plausibly claim that regimes which are designed to deal with production, or with evidence that is inherently prejudicial, can be applied across the board to deal with admissibility or with evidence that will often be relevant and highly probative. Nor for that matter can the Attorney General of Canada credibly maintain that Parliament struck the right balance where it has crudely jammed procedures from one regime onto another.

[202]                     Responding to arguments that no one made, the majority emphasizes that the right to cross‑examination is “not unlimited” (para. 183) and that no one has a right to a “perfect” trial (para. 184). But this trivializes the concerns about this regime. And it skates around a certain reality of our criminal justice system, being that these rights, while not absolute, are of the most fundamental order and have been departed from only in particular, constrained circumstances.

[203]                     My reasons focus on the constitutional infirmities of this specific legislation. Properly interpreted, the records screening regime limits the accused’s rights under ss. 11(c), 11(d) and 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in four ways:

1.                     It forces accused persons to reveal their defence before the Crown has made out a case to meet, contrary to the principle against self‑incrimination, the right to silence, and the presumption of innocence. Accused persons must disclose not only their cross‑examination strategy and potential impeachment material, but also their own prior statements, even before the Crown has opened its case. While the majority’s analysis fails to answer whether the accused’s communications with the complainant about the subject matter of the charge qualify as “records”, as I will explain, they are clearly captured. Accused persons cannot therefore even refer to the contents of those communications in their own defence without first bringing an application. Even if the records are ultimately admitted, the accused’s rights have been limited.

This alone is fatal to the regime’s constitutionality.

2.                     It restricts the accused’s ability to cross‑examine Crown witnesses by giving the complainant a role in pre‑trial admissibility determinations. The defence must generally disclose its application to the Crown and complainant at least seven days before the admissibility hearing, which risks tainting the complainant’s evidence and restricts the accused’s ability to impeach the complainant at trial. Cross‑examination remains a core component of the right to full answer and defence and the right to a fair trial. In sexual assault cases, it is often the only way to expose falsehoods, memory issues, and inconsistencies in the complainant’s testimony.

3.                     It makes private records presumptively inadmissible when tendered by the defence, but presumptively admissible when tendered by the Crown. The prosecution is not bound by the records screening regime and can freely adduce private records in support of a conviction, without pre‑trial screening. It is only when the defence wants to use the same private information to raise a reasonable doubt that it becomes dangerous. This undermines the purpose of the regime and is contrary to the right to a fair trial.

4.                     It sets a stricter test for admitting defence evidence than is warranted or constitutionally permissible. The accused must establish, in advance of the complainant’s testimony, that the records have significant probative value, meaning some relevant and probative evidence will necessarily be excluded. Combined with the broad scope of “record”, this limits the presumption of innocence and the right to full answer and defence.

[204]                     These limits are disproportionate and cannot be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. In pursuing a legitimate purpose, Parliament has proceeded in a ham‑fisted manner, without regard for fundamental rights of accused persons. The regime is not merely disadvantageous to the defence; it interferes significantly with the accused’s ability to avoid self‑incrimination, effectively cross‑examine prosecution witnesses, and adduce relevant and probative evidence during a proceeding that will decide their liberty. While the regime may advance Parliament’s objective of protecting complainants’ privacy, dignity, and equality, it does so only marginally, and at the expense of core fair trial rights.

[205]                     Parliament has legislated a formula for wrongful convictions. Indeed, it has all but guaranteed them. Like the Court that decided Seaboyer, I would not tolerate that inevitability. And like the regime at issue in Seaboyer, the records screening regime ought to be returned to Parliament to be narrowed. Parliament could have achieved its objective in a Charter‑compliant way.

II.            Legislative Background

[206]                     Two related legislative schemes preceded the records screening regime:

1.                     The s. 276 regime, enacted in 1992, limits the use of evidence of a complainant’s other sexual activity during trials for sexual offences. Prior to the enactment of s. 278.92, s. 276 was the only evidentiary rule that imposed a presumption of inadmissibility exclusively on defence evidence, which it did by categorically prohibiting evidence of a complainant’s sexual history when used to support one of two general inferences (Darrach, at para. 2). This Court upheld its constitutionality in Darrach, explaining that s. 276 is “designed to exclude irrelevant information and only that relevant information that is more prejudicial to the administration of justice than it is probative” (para. 43).

2.                     The ss. 278.1 to 278.91 regime, enacted in 1997, regulates the production of third‑party records to accused persons in sexual offence proceedings. This Court upheld its constitutionality in Mills, concluding that the regime was “carefully tailored to reflect the problem Parliament was addressing” ⸺ preserving an accused’s access to private records that may be relevant, while protecting the privacy rights of complainants and witnesses (para. 99).

[207]                     Following the enactment of those regimes, it became apparent that admissibility of documents in the possession of the accused in which the complainant has a privacy interest raised a “quite different problem” (R. v. Shearing, 2002 SCC 58, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 33, at para. 133). In R. v. Osolin, 1993 CanLII 54 (SCC), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, and Shearing, this Court stated a common law process for admissibility of records in the accused’s possession.

[208]                     In 2012, the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs reviewed the third‑party record regime. It recommended that Parliament consider creating “a procedure governing the admissibility and use during trial of a complainant’s private records, as defined in section 278.1 of the Criminal Code, which are not wrongfully in the hands of the accused” (Statutory Review on the Provisions and Operation of the Act to amend the Criminal Code (production of records in sexual offence proceedings): Final Report, at p. 20). In response, on December 13, 2018, Parliament enacted the records screening regime.

[209]                     As I have already noted more generally, the records screening regime makes presumptively inadmissible any record in the accused’s possession relating to the complainant for which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy and which the accused intends to adduce (ss. 278.1 and 278.92(1)). The proposed evidence is inadmissible, unless (1) it is admissible under s. 276, where s. 276 applies (s. 278.92(2)(a)); or in any other case, (2) it is “relevant to an issue at trial and has significant probative value that is not substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice” (s. 278.92(2)(b)). Further, s. 278.92(3) enumerates nine factors that the judge shall consider in determining admissibility, including “any other factor that the judge . . . considers relevant” (s. 278.92(3)(i)).

[210]                     Under s. 278.93(1), the accused must make an application to determine whether such evidence is admissible under ss. 276(2) or 278.92(2). Section 278.93(2) sets out the form and content of the application. The application “must be made in writing, setting out detailed particulars of the evidence that the accused seeks to adduce and the relevance of that evidence to an issue at trial”. That application must be filed and given to the Crown and the clerk of the court “at least seven days previously, or any shorter interval that the judge . . . may allow in the interests of justice” (s. 278.93(4)). If the judge is satisfied that the application has been properly served and that the evidence is “capable of being admissible”, the judge shall hold a threshold screening hearing to determine whether the evidence is admissible under ss. 276(2) or 278.92(2).

[211]                     The admissibility hearing is held in camera (s. 278.94(1)). The complainant is not compellable at the hearing but may appear and make submissions (s. 278.94(2)). The complainant has the right to be represented by counsel (s. 278.94(3)).

III.         Analysis

A.           Preliminary Points Regarding the Majority’s Analytical Structure

[212]                     I first offer this brief comment on the proper analytical framework to be applied where both ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter are raised.

[213]                     I concur with Rowe J.’s reasons. The jurisprudence on s. 7 and its relationship to other sections of the Charter, including (as here) s. 11, is doctrinally obscure and methodologically incoherent, being the product of 40 years of accumulated judicial ad hoc‑ery. The majority’s reasons regrettably extend this trajectory in a particularly regressive manner by using s. 7 not to protect the fair trial and due process guarantees under the Charter, but to erode them. This, in form and effect, makes Rowe J.’s case that our s. 7 jurisprudence is increasingly “being used as the instrument to imperil [fair trial] protection” (Rowe J.’s reasons, at para. 431). That our law has come to this curious point is, to put it mildly, remarkable and unfortunate.

[214]                     That said, in order to fully respond to the submissions and the majority’s reasons, I apply the framework from Mills and Darrach that they invoke. The majority dismisses the dissenting reasons out of hand, saying that we disregard the principle of stare decisis (para. 14). This is simply incorrect: in finding the regime unconstitutional, I apply the governing framework. More to the point, however, the majority’s plea of stare decisis is no answer to the extraordinary convolutions in the s. 7 jurisprudence that Rowe J. recounts and which, as I say, the majority’s judgment perpetuates.

[215]                     I also observe, respectfully, that the majority provides no useful guidance for courts that will in future cases have to apply the existing framework. My colleagues describe the “methodology” for assessing multiple alleged Charter breaches as “highly context- and fact‑specific” and say that it “may depend on the factual record, the nature of the Charter rights at play” and “how they intersect” (whatever that means) (para. 115). Similarly, they urge a “full appreciation of the relevant principles of fundamental justice as they operate within a particular context” (para. 122, citing Mills, at para. 63). None of this can plausibly be described as a “methodology”. It is, rather, quite the opposite, and instead makes the case that the exercise is indeed pure ad hoc‑ery, and will continue to be so.

[216]                     Secondly, we heard submissions regarding the framework to be applied where a complainant’s constitutionally protected rights are at stake ⸺ that is, whether “balancing” under Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., 1994 CanLII 39 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835, and R. v. Mentuck, 2001 SCC 76, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 442, or “reconciling” under Mills and Darrach is the appropriate framework. It is not necessary for me to decide this since, in my view, the accused’s rights are not in competition with any other set of rights here. Unlike the evidence under ss. 278.1 to 278.91 considered in Mills, the records at issue here are already in the accused’s hands, leaving no s. 8 concern for invasion of privacy by the state to be shown (Shearing, at para. 95). And unlike s. 276 evidence considered in Darrach, there is nothing categorically prejudicial about the records captured by ss. 278.92 to 278.94, and thus it is not obvious that “the privacy, dignity, and equality interests of complainants” are “at play” (again, whatever that means) (majority reasons, at para. 119). There is therefore nothing to balance, or reconcile. Further, while the majority peremptorily announces that “encouraging the reporting of sexual violence and protecting the security and privacy of witnesses” are principles of fundamental justice (at para. 120), that proposition is simply not borne out on closer inspection. As Rowe J. observes at para. 370 of his reasons, Seaboyer did not recognize those goals as principles of fundamental justice and it is unlikely they would meet the current test.

[217]                     Even if this case did “engage” competing Charter rights, Darrach and Mills would not be determinative of the constitutionality of the records screening regime. By way of background, various Attorneys General say that Parliament extended the Criminal Code’s existing protections simply to fill a “gap” where the defence already possesses private records relating to the complainant. And so the Crown characterizes the records screening regime as “a principled extension of the common law and related codified procedural and evidentiary schemes that have already survived constitutional scrutiny” (A.F. in J.J.’s case, at para. 1). The majority indiscriminately embraces this view, saying the same conclusion should follow here.

[218]                     I disagree. The records screening regime is unlike the s. 276 and ss. 278.1 to 278.91 regimes. As counsel for J.J. explained, “[i]t raises a different problem, requiring a different solution” (transcript, day 1, at p. 45). Those regimes govern situations where the accused attempts to secure or adduce material that is presumptively irrelevant by nature, and whose production or use is inherently prejudicial to trial fairness. In contrast, the records screening regime governs the use of materials in the accused’s possession that are often relevant, probative, and not inherently prejudicial. There will, for example, rarely be a risk of prejudice to the trial process (in the sense of misleading the trier of fact) where an accused impeaches the complainant using a text message that the complainant sent to the accused, and which is not relied on for myth‑based reasoning.

[219]                     As to s. 276, this Court has emphasized more than once that it captures a narrow category of evidence, and for good reason. In Seaboyer, the Court explained that its purpose was to abolish the old common law rules permitting admission of the complainant’s sexual conduct which is of little probative value and calculated to mislead the jury (p. 604). And in Darrach, Gonthier J. repeatedly emphasized that s. 276 aims to exclude only irrelevant and misleading evidence (paras. 19, 21, 25, 37, 42, 45 and 58). That justification was definitively expressed in the following passages:

     An accused has never had a right to adduce irrelevant evidence. Nor does he have the right to adduce misleading evidence to support illegitimate inferences: “the accused is not permitted to distort the truth‑seeking function of the trial process” (Mills, supra, at para. 74). Because s. 276(1) is an evidentiary rule that only excludes material that is not relevant, it cannot infringe the accused’s right to make full answer and defence. . . .

 

. . .

 

Prior sexual activity is, like hearsay, character evidence and similar fact evidence, restricted in its admissibility. If the defence seeks to adduce such evidence, it must establish that it supports at least some relevant inference.

 

. . .

 

Evidence of prior sexual activity will rarely be relevant to support a denial that sexual activity took place or to establish consent. [Emphasis added; paras. 37, 46 and 58.]

[220]                     But none of this is true of records captured by the regime established under ss. 278.92 to 278.94. Before us, the Crown argued that private records are “equally capable of raising the same concerns that animate section 276” including “the potential for myth‑based reasoning . . . that extend[s] beyond the twin myths” (transcript, day 1, at p. 11). Counsel did not clarify which myths she was referring to. The majority similarly asserts that private records are “analogous to s. 276 evidence, as they can also implicate myths that are insidious and inimical to the truth‑seeking function of the trial” (para. 162). This is another entirely peremptory assertion. There is no basis in the evidence or jurisprudence for concluding that all material engaging the complainant’s privacy interest that is in the accused’s possession will distort the truth‑seeking function of the trial. Moreover, it is belied by the case law applying the records screening regime to date, which demonstrates that “records” will often be highly relevant, probative, and unrelated to myths and stereotypes. This is all quite apart from the regime’s broad application to “records” in the hands of the defence but not in the hands of the Crown, which further highlights the differences between the impugned legislation and the s. 276 regime.

[221]                     As for ss. 278.1 to 278.91, that regime is concerned with production of records from third parties, not the admissibility of records already in the accused’s possession. The former are highly private and often confidential records that were never intended for the accused’s eyes. In Mills, the Court explained that the scope of the accused’s right to full answer and defence must be determined in light of the competing privacy and equality rights of complainants and witnesses. This exercise is necessarily context‑specific. Where the accused seeks to rely on information “that will only serve to distort the truth‑seeking purpose of a trial”, privacy and equality concerns are paramount (para. 94). On the other hand, “where the information contained in a record directly bears on the right to make full answer and defence, privacy rights must yield to the need to avoid convicting the innocent” (para. 94 (emphasis added)). This Court in Shearing made clear that the same rationales governing production do not apply to admissibility (paras. 105‑7).

[222]                     I therefore cannot agree that the constitutionality of the records screening regime flows from this Court’s statements in Mills and Darrach. Indeed, it would appear that those statements militate against the regime’s constitutionality. The records screening regime renders presumptively inadmissible the same types of records that would be produced to the accused under the Mills regime as being necessary for full answer and defence at a preliminary stage.

[223]                     Rather, the analysis turns on the interpretation of the specific provisions, particularly the following phrases:

1.                     “record”;

2.                     “which the accused intends to adduce”;

3.                     the complainant may “appear and make submissions”;

4.                     “seven days previously, or any shorter interval that the judge . . . may allow in the interests of justice”.

[224]                     I would find that the records screening regime violates both s. 11 and s. 7. For that reason, applying the existing Charter framework and responding to the parties’ submissions, I proceed to consider the records screening regime element by element rather than duplicating the analysis by considering ss. 11 and 7 breaches separately.

[225]                     With those structural points in mind, I now turn to consider the constitutionality of the records screening regime by, first, discerning its scope, then showing the four ways in which the regime limits the accused’s Charter rights.

B.            The Records Screening Regime Limits the Accused’s Rights Under Sections 11(c), 11(d) and 7 of the Charter

(1)         Overbreadth

[226]                     The records screening regime renders presumptively inadmissible a remarkably broad range of records in the hands of the defence, capturing not only records that are sensitive or prejudicial ⸺ contrary to the majority’s view. Further, it regulates their use in any manner. These conclusions flow, respectively, from the proper interpretation of the terms “record” and “adduce”.

(a)         “Record”

[227]                     As I will explain, properly interpreted, the definition of “record” is not limited to records created in a confidential context ⸺ such as therapeutic or medical records. Nor is it limited to materials containing “information of an intimate or highly personal nature that is integral to the complainant’s overall physical, psychological or emotional well‑being” (majority reasons, at para. 42). Crucially, as explained below and conceded by the Crown, it may capture digital communications sent between the accused and complainant about the subject matter of the charge.

[228]                     My colleagues in the majority attempt to rein in the definition of “record”, promising “guidance” on that matter (para. 37). But instead, recognizing that including all digital communications would render the regime overbroad, the majority reads limits into s. 278.1 that do not appear in the text, were not argued by the parties, and are inconsistent with Parliament’s intent. Four main problems with the majority’s interpretive exercise arise.

[229]                     First, as Côté J. also observes (at para. 466), the majority’s interpretation gives no helpful guidance on the central question: whether communications between the accused and complainant about the subject matter of the charge are captured by the definition of “record”. My colleagues declare that s. 278.1 captures only records that could cause “potential prejudice to the complainant’s personal dignity” (para. 53), which may include “discussions regarding mental health diagnoses, suicidal ideation, prior physical or sexual abuse, substance abuse or involvement in the child welfare system” (para. 55). According to the majority, “the scheme is not intended to catch more mundane information” such as “general emotional states, everyday occurrences or general biographical information” (paras. 53 and 56).

[230]                     No explanation is offered of how these limits are implicit in the text (which is unsurprising, since they are not). The majority claims to “consider Parliament’s intent” (para. 37), but completely absent from my colleagues’ interpretive exercise is any explanation of how that intent, as they see it, is to be drawn from the text. Nor do my colleagues even refer to the legislative proceedings, aside from their (paradoxical) observation that “the 2012 Senate Report contemplated a broad application for the record screening regime” (para. 79 (emphasis added)). We are simply left with a vague, unelaborated contextual analysis, and no practical guidance. Under the majority’s approach, it is unclear, for instance, whether the following communications between the accused and complainant would be subject to the screening regime:

1.                     messages from the complainant after an alleged sexual assault indicating she did not remember the events or providing an inconsistent version of events as compared to her police statement;

2.                     angry or abusive messages sent between the parties during a breakdown of their relationship referring back to the alleged sexual assault;

3.                     sexualized or flirtatious text conversations before or after the alleged sexual assault, arranging plans to meet again.

[231]                     Do any of these records contain information “of an intimate and highly personal nature that is integral to the complainant’s overall physical, psychological or emotional well‑being”? Are they records “of an explicit sexual nature” that “concern the subject matter of the charge” (majority reasons, at para. 71)? The answer is not obvious (or even discernible) on the majority’s analysis, yet knowing this is critical to the accused’s ability to mount a defence. If those communications are captured, the accused cannot refer to them when responding to the Crown’s case, without having disclosed them in advance. As the majority observes, communications between the complainant and accused are the most contentious and litigated aspect of the records screening regime. (For instance, see R. v. A.C., 2020 ONSC 184 (emails between the accused and the complainant regarding the breakdown of their marriage); R. v. Navaratnam, 2021 ONCJ 272, 488 C.R.R. (2d) 214 (records of communications with the complainant from before and after the alleged assault); R. v. Whitehouse, 2020 NSSC 87, 61 C.R. (7th) 400 (records of communications between the accused and the complainant and the complainant and third parties); R. v. McKnight, 2019 ABQB 755, 7 Alta. L.R. (7th) 195 (text messages sent by the complainant to the accused); R. v. A.M., 2020 ONSC 8061, 397 C.C.C. (3d) 379 (WhatsApp messages sent between the accused and the complainant during their marriage); R. v. S.R. (2021), 488 C.R.R. (2d) 95 (Ont. S.C.J.) (WhatsApp messages between the accused and his former spouse).)

[232]                     Secondly, the majority’s definition of “personal information” and “reasonable expectation of privacy” is inexplicably narrow. Sherman Estate v. Donovan, 2021 SCC 25, was a civil case addressing the specific situation where “[p]roceedings in open court can lead to the dissemination of highly sensitive personal information that would result not just in discomfort or embarrassment, but in an affront to the affected person’s dignity” (para. 7 (emphasis added)). The majority uses that “narrower dimension of privacy” to define all “personal information” under s. 278.1. This definition is, however, inconsistent with privacy legislation that uses the same phrase. For instance, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, S.C. 2000, c. 5, s. 2(1), defines “personal information” broadly as any “information about an identifiable individual”. My colleagues’ interpretation also creates different tiers of reasonable expectations of privacy under s. 8 and under s. 278.1, despite their own observation that s. 8’s “terms and concepts ‘inform the content and meaning of the words in [the] section’” (para. 46). And the majority’s definition leaves unanswered questions regarding the third‑party records regime, which they acknowledge is governed by the same definition (para. 36). Though the majority emphasizes that their interpretation is “specific to the record screening regime” (para. 54), they do not explain how the same words can logically be interpreted in two different ways while remaining true to the legislative intent.

[233]                     Thirdly, the majority’s interpretation contradicts Shearing. The complainant’s diary recorded only “mundane” entries ⸺ yet the Court held that the nature of the content did “not at all eliminate her privacy interest” (para. 148; see also paras. 85 and 112). As the complainant in Shearing put it: “Whether it’s mundane or exciting or boring, it’s still mine” (para. 87 (emphasis added)). While the majority acknowledges, at para. 78, that the circumstances of Shearing represented “one of the motivating factors” for the Senate Committee’s recommendations, that evidence would likely not be captured under their definition. Ironically, while my colleagues recognize that “it would be illogical to interpret the impugned provisions in a manner that would not address the very situation at issue in that case” (para. 78), that is precisely what they have done. This contradiction reveals how far they have strayed from Parliament’s intent. It also leaves important questions unanswered. Will other records containing more “mundane” information be governed by the common law under Shearing, or admitted without screening? If a digital conversation contains both sensitive and mundane information, will the defence still have to disclose the entire string of messages?

[234]                     Finally, the majority’s analytical process will prove complex and time‑consuming. The upshot of the contextual analysis is that the net is cast extremely wide. The majority directs that, “[w]hen it is unclear whether the evidence is a ‘record’, counsel should err on the side of caution and initiate Stage One of the record screening process” (para. 72). With respect, given the majority’s treatment of the meaning of “record”, this will be unclear in most cases, and most accused persons will as a consequence be forced to disclose early and often. The majority’s own reasons confirm this. They contemplate that accused persons may bring motions for directions to avoid having to disclose everything, but this adds a further procedural step not contemplated by the legislation. Further, the majority recognizes this may not resolve the issue, since the presiding judge may still be “uncertain” about “whether the proposed evidence is a ‘record’” (para. 104). Where that occurs, the majority also says, the judge “should instruct the accused to proceed with an application” (para. 104). In the result, accused persons will have to disclose all the communications in their possession so the trial judge can sift through each message to determine if it contains “information of an intimate and highly personal nature”.

[235]                     If, then, the majority’s legislative refinements to Parliament’s broad definition of “record” are unsustainable, what does that definition capture? A “record” is defined for the purposes of the records screening regime as anything that “contains personal information for which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy” (s. 278.1). While this Court in Mills (at paras. 78 and 97‑101) approved substantially the same definition of “record” as applied to the third‑party record regime, it does not follow that it can be endorsed as applied to the records screening regime. The principles underlying the regimes are different; in Mills, the Court considered the scope of “record” in the context of production of records ⸺ such as personal health and counselling records ⸺ from third parties, not admissibility of records already in the accused’s possession. Further, neither Parliament when enacting this definition in 1997, nor the Court when upholding its constitutionality in 1999, considered digital communications.

[236]                     An interpretive question therefore arises: when Parliament borrowed the definition of “record” from s. 278.1, did it intend to capture digital communications in the records screening regime? The provision does not refer to electronic communications or personal correspondence. The enumerated types of records are those either subject to professional confidentiality obligations (such as medical and child adoption records) or intended exclusively for the complainant’s own use (such as diaries). That said, the phrase “and includes” indicates that the list is not exhaustive. This Court in R. v. Quesnelle, 2014 SCC 46, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 390, rejected the argument that s. 278.1 was meant to capture only records shared in the context of “trust‑like, confidential, or therapeutic relationships”, and confirmed that documents not falling within the enumerated list are nonetheless included if they contain information giving rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy (paras. 22-23 and 27).

[237]                     While the majority’s analysis is painstakingly non-committal on this point, the legislative proceedings suggest that Parliament did indeed intend to capture digital conversations between the accused and complainant.[1] Significantly, during debate on the records screening regime in the Senate, the Hon. Murray Sinclair referenced the trial of R. v. Ghomeshi, 2016 ONCJ 155, 27 C.R. (7th) 17, where defence counsel impeached the complainants using text messages exchanged with the accused (Debates of the Senate, vol. 150, No. 233, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., October 3, 2018, at p. 6419). Parliament received a proposal from defence lawyers to exclude from the Bill’s ambit digital correspondence between the complainant and accused in which there is a joint privacy interest, but Parliament did not accede to that request (R. v. R.M.R., 2019 BCSC 1093, 56 C.R. (7th) 414, at para. 34; Crown’s submissions in A.S.’s case, transcript, day 1, at p. 128).

[238]                     Alongside the legislative debates emphasizing the protection of privacy and equality rights for all sexual assault complainants must also be read this Court’s jurisprudence recognizing that electronic communications often contain highly private content (R. v. Marakah, 2017 SCC 59, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 608). While the ultimate concern under s. 8 is whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy as against the state, the jurisprudence contemplates that individuals may also have a reasonable expectation of privacy as against other individuals, and that these expectations may arise from some of the same concerns (R. v. Jarvis, 2019 SCC 10, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 488, at para. 58). The weight of the jurisprudence applying s. 278.92 has concluded that the complainant retains a reasonable expectation of privacy in electronic communications sent to the accused (see, e.g., R. v. M.S., 2019 ONCJ 670, at para. 68 (CanLII); McKnight, at paras. 13 and 25; R.M.R., at para. 33; R. v. D.L.B., 2020 YKTC 8, 460 C.R.R. (2d) 162, at paras. 76‑77).

[239]                     All of this compels the conclusion that an electronic communication (such as an email or text message) is a “record” if it contains personal information giving rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy, as that term has been interpreted in the s. 8 jurisprudence. This would include any communication concerning the subject matter of the charge, whether of an “explicit sexual nature” or not.

(b)         “Adduce”

[240]                     I agree with the majority that the records screening regime applies both to material in the accused’s possession, and the information contained in that material. It therefore regulates not only the use of the record itself but the information it contains (majority reasons, at para. 76). Meaning, accused persons must apply if they intend merely to refer to the contents of any communication with the complainant, even in their own defence, contrary to the principle against self‑incrimination, the presumption of innocence, and the right to silence.

[241]                     On the point of its constitutionality, there should be no misunderstanding as to the consequences of the breadth of meaning to be given to “adduce”. Accused persons must now bring a s. 278.92 application anytime they intend to refer to the contents of a private record relating to the complainant, even if they do not seek to enter it into evidence or use it to impeach the complainant, but instead simply wish to refer to it in their own defence. In contrast, the Crown would be free to use the same text message exchange from the accused to support the complainant’s narrative. As the defence argues, the resulting breadth of the regime’s application is not a reason to read it down, but “rather an indicator of its inaptness (s. 278.1 was never intended to be a ‘defence disclosure’ metric) and ultimate unconstitutionality” (R.F. in J.J.’s case, at para. 41).

(c)           Conclusion on Overbreadth

[242]                     The focus in an overbreadth analysis is properly directed to the relationship between the law’s purpose and its effects (R. v. Moriarity, 2015 SCC 55, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 485, at para. 24). The analysis proceeds in two steps. First, a court must identify the purpose of the law. Then, it must determine whether the law deprives individuals of life, liberty or security of the person in cases that do not further the object of the law (assuming a lawful legislative objective) (R. v. Safarzadeh‑Markhali, 2016 SCC 14, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 180, at paras. 24‑31; Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, 2013 SCC 72, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1101, at paras. 58, 93, 101, 108 and 111-12; R. v. Appulonappa, 2015 SCC 59, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 754, at paras. 26‑27).

[243]                     The purpose of the records screening regime, based on the text and legislative history, is threefold: (1) ensuring that a complainant’s privacy, dignity and equality interests are considered when determining whether private records are admissible; (2) improving victim and community confidence in the justice system, which will likely encourage victims to report sexual crimes; and (3) maintaining the integrity of the trial process by refusing to admit evidence potentially rooted in myths and stereotypes which risk jeopardizing the truth‑seeking function of the trial.

[244]                     The breadth of this regime suggests two possible justifications, being either that every record in the hands of the accused has the inherent potential to engage myths and stereotypes; or, the risk that some private records might advance myths and stereotypes is sufficiently severe to justify capturing all kinds of material that will not have this effect. Since no evidence of the relationship between private records in the hands of the accused and myth‑based reasoning has been presented, the first justification cannot stand. It follows that Parliament must have relied on the second justification, which is by its terms demonstrative of overbreadth. As J.J.’s counsel put it, “[i]f the purpose of the regime is to exclude presumptively irrelevant and prejudicial records, then reasonable expectation of privacy is an inapt indicator of that type of danger” (transcript, day 1, at p. 51).

[245]                     The majority concludes that the “requirement on accused persons to disclose these records in advance — even where it is unclear to what extent the evidence would have a bearing on complainants’ dignity — is still rationally connected to the overarching objective of the regime” (para. 142). But that conclusion is only possible because of two flaws, upon which their entire analysis rests: their departure from legislative intent as to the meaning of “record”; and their refusal to squarely (and thus meaningfully) address obvious concerns raised by the parties and interveners about advance disclosure, the right to silence, and the right to cross‑examine.

[246]                     It is this simple. The records screening regime requires disclosure of defence evidence that would not distort the truth‑seeking process or significantly interfere with the complainant’s privacy, all before the Crown makes out a case to meet. Since it captures all private records relating to the complainant that are in the accused’s possession, which the accused intends to adduce or rely on in any manner, and which may include the accused’s own digital conversations with the complainant about the subject matter of the charge, it could deprive individuals of liberty in situations that have no connection whatsoever to the object of the law. It follows that it goes too far and interferes with some conduct that bears no connection to its objective (Bedford, at para. 101; application judge’s reasons in A.S.’s case (R. v. Reddick, 2020 ONSC 7156, 398 C.C.C. (3d) 227), at para. 49).

(2)         Disclosure of Detailed Particulars of Evidence

[247]                     The records screening regime compels accused persons to disclose “detailed particulars of the evidence that the accused seeks to adduce and the relevance of that evidence to an issue at trial” to the Crown “seven days previously, or any shorter interval that the judge . . . may allow in the interests of justice” (s. 278.93(2) and (4)). In effect ⸺ and there was really no dispute about this at the hearing of these appeals ⸺ this requires accused persons to disclose, in detail, particulars of their own prior statements and strategy, even before the Crown has laid out a case to be answered. This is contrary to the principle against self‑incrimination, the right to silence, the presumption of innocence, and the principle that the Crown must establish a case to be met before the accused can be reasonably expected to respond.

[248]                     The phrase “seven days previously” has been interpreted both strictly and flexibly in decisions that have considered the records screening regime. I agree with the majority that the strict interpretation is the correct one and that an application should be brought pre‑trial in the vast majority of cases (majority reasons, at para. 86). While the majority offers one example of where mid‑trial applications should be permitted in “the interests of justice” (para. 86), such instances should, properly understood, be exceptional. The notice period may be abridged only where the accused can point to an exceptional circumstance and where the court finds it is “in the interests of justice” to do so ⸺ for example, where identity is at issue or new and unanticipated information is elicited through cross‑examination.

[249]                     The effect on the liberty of the subject represented by the records screening regime is unprecedented. Never before has the state compelled disclosure of defence evidence that is neither presumptively irrelevant nor prejudicial, before the close of the Crown’s case. This is not some tinkering around the edges of the rules of evidence. It shifts away from foundational principles of our criminal trial process, violating the principle against self‑incrimination, the right to silence, the presumption of innocence, and the related principle that the Crown must establish a “case to meet” before the accused can be expected to respond (R. v. P. (M.B.), 1994 CanLII 125 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 555, at pp. 577‑78).

[250]                     Section 11(c) of the Charter provides that any person charged with an offence has the right “not to be compelled to be a witness in proceedings against that person in respect of the offence”. This denotes, inter alia, that no duty rests on an accused to disclose the details of its defence before the Crown has completed its case (R. v. Chambers, 1990 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1293, at p. 1319). The defence has no obligation to assist the prosecution, and the absence of a reciprocal disclosure obligation is an expression of the principle against self‑incrimination (R. v. Stinchcombe, 1991 CanLII 45 (SCC), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, at p. 333; P. (M.B.), at pp. 577-78). These principles, which the majority skates over, were explained by Lamer C.J. in P. (M.B.):

     Perhaps the single most important organizing principle in criminal law is the right of an accused not to be forced into assisting in his or her own prosecution. . . . [A]n accused is under no obligation to respond until the state has succeeded in making out a prima facie case against him or her. In other words, until the Crown establishes that there is a “case to meet”, an accused is not compellable in a general sense (as opposed to the narrow, testimonial sense) and need not answer the allegations against him or her.

 

The broad protection afforded to accused persons is perhaps best described in terms of the overarching principle against self‑incrimination, which is firmly rooted in the common law and is a fundamental principle of justice under s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. As a majority of this Court suggested in Dubois v. The Queen, 1985 CanLII 10 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 350, the presumption of innocence and the power imbalance between the state and the individual are at the root of this principle and the procedural and evidentiary protections to which it gives rise.

 

Before trial, the criminal law seeks to protect an accused from being conscripted against him‑ or herself by the confession rule, the right to remain silent in the face of state interrogation into suspected criminal conduct, and the absence of a duty of disclosure on the defence: R. v. Hebert, 1990 CanLII 118 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151. With respect to disclosure, the defence in Canada is under no legal obligation to cooperate with or assist the Crown by announcing any special defence, such as an alibi, or by producing documentary or physical evidence. . . .

 

. . .

 

All of these protections, which emanate from the broad principle against self‑incrimination, recognize that it is up to the state, with its greater resources, to investigate and prove its own case, and that the individual should not be conscripted into helping . . . fulfil this task. [Emphasis added; pp. 577-79.]

[251]                     The majority attempts to distinguish P. (M.B.), saying it addressed only specific concerns arising from the Crown re‑opening its case after the defence began giving evidence at trial (para. 166). But this ignores the very rationale behind limiting reopening of the Crown’s case: because “the right of accused persons not to be conscripted against themselves will be compromised” (R. v. G. (S.G.), 1997 CanLII 311 (SCC), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 716, at para. 38). The majority further says the likelihood of prejudice to the accused is lower before trial (at para. 168), but neither P. (M.B.) nor G. (S.G.) contemplated pre‑trial defence disclosure. Significantly, however, each case confirmed that “the most significant concern is that the accused will have responded to the Crown’s case without knowing the full case to be met” (G. (S.G.), at para. 42 (emphasis added)). This same concern arises with the records screening regime. In light of all this, the very suggestion there is no possibility of prejudice where the accused is required to disclose trial evidence and strategy before the Crown has even opened its case is extraordinary.

[252]                     The Crown in J.J.’s case makes three arguments supporting the records screening regime’s compliance with the right to silence and principle against self‑incrimination.

[253]                     First, the Crown says that the records screening regime is substantially identical to the procedures governing s. 276 and ss. 278.1 to 278.91 applications (A.F. in J.J.’s case, at para. 116), adding that this Court upheld the requirement to file a detailed affidavit in Darrach. While those provisions do not provide for formal notice to the complainant, the Court assumed that the Crown would likely consult with the complainant (Darrach, at paras. 9 and 55). And in Mills, the Court upheld the requirement to serve a written application on the complainant detailing why the record is likely relevant.

[254]                     The majority accepts this argument, remarking that the records screening regime does not apply to all defence evidence but “to a narrow set of evidence that implicates important interests of complainants . . . and has the potential to create serious prejudice” (para. 162). But simply asserting it to be so does not make it so. As discussed, it applies to a broad swathe of evidence that is not inherently prejudicial or irrelevant. The majority further asserts that, like s. 276 evidence, s. 278.92 evidence can implicate “insidious” myths and encroach on the privacy and dignity of the complainant, so “[private records] too require screening to ensure trial fairness” (para. 162). But this ignores that evidence relying on the twin myths will already be captured under s. 276. While the majority criticizes my analysis for not “meaningfully” recognizing “other problematic myths and stereotypes” aside from the twin myths (at para. 132), my colleagues miss the point. Nobody disputes that records in the accused’s possession could implicate other myths. My point is that it cannot be assumed that such records inherently do so ⸺ which distinguishes them from third‑party records and evidence of other sexual activity. This is a point for which my colleagues steadfastly fail to account ⸺ an omission which in my respectful view should cast serious doubt upon their entire analysis.

[255]                     Darrach and Mills are no answer to the self‑incrimination problems raised by the records screening regime. While this Court approved advance disclosure to the Crown and complainant in Darrach for evidence of other sexual activity, the principles stated in Darrach are limited to the application of s. 276, which is designed to exclude only irrelevant information, and relevant information that is more prejudicial to the administration of justice than it is probative (Darrach, at paras. 43 and 45). Compelling the accused to bring an application with particulars did not impact the right to silence in Darrach because no one has an unfettered right to adduce irrelevant or prejudicial evidence (Criminal Trial Lawyers’ Association Factum in J.J.’s case (“CTLA Factum”), at para. 12). That same rationale does not apply here (see, e.g., R. v. J.S., [2019] A.J. No. 1639 (QL) (Q.B.), at para. 23; R. v. A.M., 2019 SKPC 46, 56 C.R. (7th) 389, at para. 39). Moreover, the s. 276 regime only requires an affidavit to explain the relevance of evidence, not potential disclosure of evidence that could assist the Crown in proving its case ⸺ a fundamental difference for which, again, the majority fails to account.

[256]                     Similarly, the Mills decision was concerned with compelled production of confidential materials from third parties, not admissibility, and raises different sensitivity and privacy concerns compared to records in the accused’s possession (D.L.B., at paras. 73‑74). For that reason, this Court in Mills did not consider the impact of advance document disclosure on the accused’s cross‑examination rights (R. v. Farah, 2021 YKSC 36, at para. 78 (CanLII)).

[257]                     Secondly, the Crown emphasizes that the right to silence and case‑to‑meet principle are not absolute. The Crown refers to eight circumstances in which the accused “may be required to provide disclosure of some aspect of their defence if they wish to raise a reasonable doubt” (A.F. in J.J.’s case, at para. 117). The majority adopts this argument, offering two examples ⸺ aside from the s. 276 regime ⸺ where the defence is required to provide advance disclosure: alibi evidence and Scopelliti applications (majority reasons, at paras. 158-59). It is true that the law imposes limited obligations on parties to provide disclosure so as to justify questioning or admission of evidence in three situations that do not unconstitutionally limit the right to silence:

1.                     as part of a voir dire where the accused bears the burden of proof (for instance, a notice of constitutional question or Garofoli application);

2.                     after the Crown has closed its case (for instance, expert evidence, Corbett applications, and alibi evidence); or

3.                     in respect of evidence that is presumptively inadmissible because of its inherently prejudicial qualities (for instance, s. 276, hearsay, and bad character evidence) (CTLA Factum, at paras. 6‑8).

[258]                     None of these instances remotely support the majority’s conclusion that the right to silence is unaffected by the records screening regime. The examples in category (1) are not about raising a reasonable doubt, since the voir dire has no impact on the accused’s guilt or innocence (CTLA Factum, at para. 7). Further, when the accused brings a Charter challenge, it is not required to disclose particulars of evidence or trial strategy, and certainly not its own prior statements. Two of the examples in category (2) ⸺ expert evidence and Corbett applications ⸺ do not require the accused to disclose anything until the prosecution’s witnesses have testified and the Crown has made out a case to meet. The third example (alibi evidence) is truly a tactical choice because there is no legal requirement to disclose an alibi (CTLA Factum, at para. 8). The examples in category (3) ⸺ evidence of other sexual activity, hearsay, or bad character ⸺ are, by their nature, typically unreliable, misleading, or pose a serious risk of prejudicing the trial if admitted without screening (CTLA Factum, at para. 9). Since no one has an unfettered right to adduce irrelevant or prejudicial evidence, the law quite rightly requires the accused to show a basis for admissibility in those situations.

[259]                     These situations relied upon by the Crown and the majority are simply not comparable. The records screening regime requires the accused to disclose, to the complainant and to the Crown before the Crown has made out a case to meet, detailed particulars of the accused’s evidence and its relevance to an issue at trial. None of it need be irrelevant or inherently prejudicial, and much of it will not be so. Certainly, some records will be highly sensitive, while others might invite improper reasoning, such as counselling records used to establish that the complainant is the sort of person who would require therapy or to compare the complainant’s behaviour to that of a “true” victim. Given the broad range of records captured by the screening regime, each record could fall somewhere differently on the probative‑prejudicial spectrum; it is impossible to determine in the abstract. Yet Parliament has attempted to do exactly that by treating, from the outset, an entire category of evidence as sufficiently dangerous to warrant limiting the right to silence.

[260]                     The Crown’s final argument on the right to silence and principle against self‑incrimination relies on a passage from Darrach where the Court held that the right to silence was not impacted because the “compulsion” to provide disclosure was only “tactical” (A.F. in J.J.’s case, at para. 99; Darrach, at para. 47). But the Court in Darrach never concluded that tactical burdens to provide pre‑trial disclosure are automatically Charter‑compliant. Gonthier J.’s comments must be considered in the context of the type of evidence at issue, which was s. 276 evidence, and his conclusion that tactical pressure to disclose was not “premature or inappropriate” was largely premised on its inherently prejudicial and irrelevant nature (paras. 46, 55 and 59).

[261]                     Moreover, confronting an accuser with all relevant evidence is quite different than making tactical choices such as challenging a search warrant. I accept J.J.’s argument that, if bringing a s. 278.92 application to rely on the accused’s own communications about the subject matter of the charge to challenge the Crown’s case or raise a defence can be minimized as a “tactical” decision, the same could apply to all defence evidence, such that the accused could, constitutionally, be compelled to reveal all potential evidence or questioning material prior to trial (R.F., at paras. 115‑117; see also CTLA Factum, at para. 17). As the CTLA emphasizes, “the right to silence cannot yield in other circumstances or it would effectively cease to exist” (para. 17). Such a result would be contrary to this Court’s precedents in Chambers and P. (M.B.) and cannot be what the Court envisioned in Darrach. The majority dismisses this as a “slippery slope” argument (para. 162). I say with respect that, in doing so, the majority minimizes legitimate and obvious concerns raised by these parties and interveners about the impacts of its ruling, as if these concerns were unworthy of taking seriously. It is no answer simply to impugn a concern as a “slippery slope” argument. After all, some slopes are slippery.

[262]                     The limits to the protection from self‑incrimination and the right to silence are, on their own, fatal to the constitutionality of the records screening regime. While the Crown argues that the regime is simply a screening device through which highly relevant and probative evidence may pass, the violations to the self‑incrimination principle are in no way attenuated by their later admission: “The harm is done by conscription” (transcript, day 2, at p. 73). Even where defence evidence is ultimately admitted, the regime still limits an accused’s s. 11(c) and (d) and s. 7 rights. I turn now to another aspect of that concern.

(3)         Restrictions on Cross‑Examination of Crown Witnesses

[263]                     As already noted, the records screening regime compels accused persons to give advance notice to the complainant and Crown seven days before the hearing, and to provide detailed particulars of the evidence they wish to rely on, complete with an explanation of why it is relevant to an issue at trial. Where that relevance pertains to the frailties in the Crown’s case or theory of the defence case, the accused must therefore reveal them. The regime also permits the complainant to appear and make submissions at the admissibility hearing. Taken together, these provisions limit the accused’s ability to effectively cross‑examine the complainant, contrary to the presumption of innocence, the right to make full answer and defence and the right to a fair trial. 

[264]                     As a preliminary point, I do not see the complainant’s entitlement under s. 278.94(2) and (3) to retain counsel and to appear and make submissions at the admissibility hearing as necessarily a concern. The question is how far those participatory rights extend.

[265]                     I agree with the majority’s interpretation that the complainant should have access to the application record once it passes the threshold screening (that is, once a judge determines the evidence is capable of being admissible) (majority reasons, at para. 93). A provision entitling the complainant to retain counsel and make submissions should be interpreted in a manner that permits counsel to make meaningful submissions. While the majority suggests that complainants have only limited standing to address the impacts on their privacy and dignity interests (para. 178), in point of fact the legislation permits them to make submissions on admissibility, which is broader than complainant participation in the Mills regime. Nevertheless, I agree with the majority that the regime does not contemplate a right to cross‑examine the accused, or to adduce evidence at the hearing (paras. 100-102). It follows, then, that I would not accept the application judge’s conclusion in A.S.’s case that the regime threatens prosecutorial independence and effectively makes the complainant a second prosecutor (paras. 91 and 102).

[266]                     I return, then, to my point that the advance disclosure requirement and complainant’s participatory rights operate together to limit the accused’s right to cross‑examine the complainant. The analysis necessarily starts with the presumption of innocence, which is no mere legal nicety. It is the most elementary manifestation of society’s commitment to a fair trial, grounded in the precept, “basic to our concept of justice”, that “the innocent must not be convicted” (Seaboyer, at p. 606). It is “a hallowed principle lying at the very heart of criminal law” that “confirms our faith in humankind” (R. v. Oakes, 1986 CanLII 46 (SCC), [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, at pp. 119‑20; see also R. v. Myers, 2019 SCC 18, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 105, at para. 1). Such breathless statements can often be safely dismissed as mere judicial puffery. But not these. The significance of the presumption of innocence to our system of criminal justice simply cannot be understated. And, while it is expressly protected in s. 11(d), it is also “inextricably intertwined” with the broader protection of life, liberty and security of the person contained in s. 7 (R. v. Rose, 1998 CanLII 768 (SCC), [1998] 3 S.C.R. 262, at para. 95, citing Seaboyer, at p. 603).

[267]                     Giving meaning and operation to the presumption of innocence is the accused’s right to make full answer and defence. This extends to calling the evidence necessary to establish a defence, and challenging the evidence called by the prosecution (Seaboyer, at p. 608). Full answer and defence is not unqualified; relevant evidence can be excluded where the exclusion is justified by a ground of law or policy, such as where the evidence is unduly prejudicial or likely to distort the fact‑finding process (Seaboyer, at p. 609; Mills, at paras. 74‑75). But a rule which “prevents the trier of fact from getting at the truth by excluding relevant evidence in the absence of a clear ground of policy or law justifying the exclusion runs afoul of our fundamental conceptions of justice and what constitutes a fair trial” (Seaboyer, at p. 609).

[268]                     The accused’s right to cross‑examine Crown witnesses without significant and unwarranted constraint is a key element of the right to make full answer and defence and the right to a fair trial (R. v. N.S., 2012 SCC 72, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 726, at para. 24; R. v. R.V., 2019 SCC 41, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 237, at para. 39). Unwarranted constraints on cross‑examination may undermine the fairness of the trial (R. v. Lyttle, 2004 SCC 5, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 193, at para. 2; N.S., at para. 24), and increase the risk of convicting the innocent. As this Court recognized in Lyttle, cross‑examination is often the only way to expose the truth:

     Cross‑examination may often be futile and sometimes prove fatal, but it remains nonetheless a faithful friend in the pursuit of justice and an indispensable ally in the search for truth. At times, there will be no other way to expose falsehood, to rectify error, to correct distortion or to elicit vital information that would otherwise remain forever concealed.

 

     That is why the right of an accused to cross‑examine witnesses for the prosecution — without significant and unwarranted constraint — is an essential component of the right to make full answer and defence. [Emphasis in original; paras. 1-2.]

[269]                     The importance of cross‑examination was recently restated in R.V.:

     Generally, a key element of the right to make full answer and defence is the right to cross‑examine the Crown’s witnesses without significant and unwarranted restraint: R. v. Lyttle, 2004 SCC 5, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 193, at paras. 1 and 41; Osolin, at pp. 664‑65; Seaboyer, at p. 608. The right to cross‑examine is protected by both ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter. In certain circumstances, cross‑examination may be the only way to get at the truth. The fundamental importance of cross‑examination is reflected in the general rule that counsel is permitted to ask any question for which they have a good faith basis — an independent evidentiary foundation is not required: Lyttle, at paras. 46‑48. [Emphasis added; para. 39.]

[270]                     As these statements recognize, cross‑examination may be the only way for an accused to avail itself of its right to make full answer and defence ⸺ that is, to challenge the Crown’s case, and to raise a reasonable doubt in the trier of fact’s mind. This is particularly so in sexual assault cases, where the complainant will often be the only witness to testify (Farah, at para. 74). This Court in Lyttle, at para. 70, cited with approval the reasons of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Wallick (1990), 1990 CanLII 11128 (MB CA), 69 Man. R. (2d) 310, at para. 2:

     Cross‑examination is a most powerful weapon of the defence, particularly when the entire case turns on credibility of the witnesses. An accused in a criminal case has the right of cross‑examination in the fullest and widest sense of the word as long as he does not abuse that right. Any improper interference with the right is an error which will result in the conviction being quashed.

[271]                     As this Court has also recognized, reasonable limits may be placed on the cross‑examination of a complainant in a sexual assault trial to prevent it from being used for improper purposes (Osolin, at pp. 665-66). But the Court has also recognized that cross‑examination in respect of consent and credibility should be permitted where the probative value is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice that may flow from it (Osolin, at p. 671). And so, the Court has understood that allowing the accused “wide latitude” to cross‑examine the complainant in sexual offence cases is crucial to achieving trial fairness (Lyttle, at para. 50, citing Shearing, at paras. 121‑22).

[272]                     To all this, the majority says only that the right to cross‑examine is not violated here because there is no right to “ambus[h]” the complainant with highly private records at trial or cross‑examine the complainant on “every scintilla” of information (paras. 183-84). Their analysis assumes that any cross‑examination on s. 278.92 records would be unfair or irrelevant, which is demonstrably not so. It also mischaracterizes the defence arguments. The common law already protects complainants from unfair or irrelevant cross‑examination. J.J. and Mr. Reddick seek merely to preserve their remaining right to cross‑examine prosecution witnesses “without significant and unwarranted constraint” (Lyttle, at para. 2). This Court in Darrach did not remove the right to contemporaneous cross‑examination on private information. Gonthier J. simply confirmed that the defence cannot “ambush” complainants with inherently prejudicial and irrelevant evidence:

     Section 276 does not require the accused to make premature or inappropriate disclosure to the Crown. For the reasons given above, the accused is not forced to embark upon the process under s. 276 at all. As the trial judge found in the case at bar, if the defence is going to raise the complainant’s prior sexual activity, it cannot be done in such a way as to surprise the complainant. The right to make full answer and defence does not include the right to defend by ambush. [Emphasis added; para. 55.]

[273]                     Those comments were clearly intended to apply only to presumptively inadmissible evidence of prior sexual activity. They cannot be divorced from their context. The issue in Darrach was whether the complainant could be cross‑examined about her sexual history extrinsic to the allegations. The proposed cross‑examination was intensely intimate and potentially embarrassing, and the evidence was presumptively irrelevant. Thus, Gonthier J.’s statement was “a s. 276‑specific reminder that extrinsic sexual activity is always prejudicial, and ⸺ because it is often temporally distant, intimate and historically prone to misuse ⸺ likely to cause undue confusion and distress if brought up without warning” (R.F. in J.J.’s case, at para. 57). To suggest that it was an unqualified statement that the right to make full answer and defence excludes the right to surprise the complainant is baseless and, further, corrosive of the accused’s right to make full answer and defence (see majority reasons, at paras. 183-84).

[274]                     The majority minimizes the defence concerns by echoing that the right to a fair trial does not entitle the accused to the most favourable procedures imaginable (see paras. 125 and 184). And, as this Court has repeatedly intoned, accused persons are not entitled to a “perfect trial” (R. v. White, 2011 SCC 13, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 433, at para. 194; R. v. Carosella, 1997 CanLII 402 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 80, at para. 74; R. v. Cook, 1998 CanLII 802 (SCC), [1998] 2 S.C.R. 597, at para. 101; R. v. Khan, 2001 SCC 86, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 823, at para. 72; G. (S.G.), at para. 101; R. v. Lyons, 1987 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at p. 362; R. v. Harrer, 1995 CanLII 70 (SCC), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 562, at paras. 14 and 45; R. v. Orbanski, 2005 SCC 37, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 97; R. v. Find, 2001 SCC 32, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 863, at para. 28; R. v. Bjelland, 2009 SCC 38, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 651, at para. 22). But, and with respect, this “answers” an argument that nobody has made. Nobody is seeking “perfection” here; we are already a long way from the most favourable trial. Eventually, at some point on the long road that the majority has taken from “Perfect Trial” to “Unfair Trial”, the refrain that there can be “no perfect trials” wears thin. It cannot be used ad infinitum to chip away at fair trial guarantees.

[275]                     The majority offers a second reason that the right to cross‑examine is not violated here. They say that, since “witness tainting” is not a concern where the Crown provides disclosure to the accused under Stinchcombe, or where both parties in civil proceedings disclose their records, it follows that it is not a concern here (paras. 185‑86). This assertion is thwarted by basic organizing principles of criminal law. The search for the truth is not the only relevant consideration when defence disclosure is at issue. Unlike the Crown or a defendant in civil proceedings, the accused faces the greater power of the state and a potential loss of liberty. For those reasons, the accused has (until now) benefited from the presumption of innocence and the right to remain silent until the Crown makes out a case to meet (see, e.g., P. (M.B.), at pp. 577-79). Further, neither Stinchcombe nor civil procedure rules require the other party to disclose its strategy or theory of the case.

[276]                     The majority further declares that the notice and disclosure requirements enhance trial fairness. They assert that providing advance notice to complainants that they may be confronted with highly private information in open court will better equip them to respond (para. 187). The Crown in J.J.’s case, the complainant A.S., and several intervenors made similar arguments, saying “ambush”‑style cross‑examination that aims to “disorient and discombobulate” a witness hinders rather than promotes the truth‑seeking function, and that a prepared complainant is less likely to be emotional and more likely to provide logical and coherent responses (A.F. in J.J.’s case, at para. 131; A.F. in A.S.’s case, at para. 55; I.F. of AGO, at paras. 27-35; I.F. of AGNS in J.J.’s case, at paras. 81‑82; I.F. of LEAF, at paras. 27 and 29; I.F. of WCLEAF-WAVAW in A.S.’s case, at para. 19).

[277]                     There is a certain unreality to the Crown’s claims. As this Court has observed, “trials are not — nor are they meant to be — tea parties”, particularly where the right of an accused to make full answer and defence is at stake (Groia v. Law Society of Upper Canada, 2018 SCC 27, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 772, at para. 3). At the very least, this submission relies on social science “evidence” that is not properly before this Court. And it completely ignores the witness exclusion rule, which is itself grounded on the premise that advance disclosure of counsel’s dossier or strategy comes with the significant risk that complainants’ evidence will as a consequence be tailored or tainted (application judge’s reasons in A.S.’s case, at para. 57). The requirement to provide detailed particulars requires accused persons to reveal frailties in the Crown’s evidence that they seek to prove through the record and through its subjection to cross‑examination.

[278]                     This speaks to why we have the witness exclusion rule: to preserve testimony in its original state (R. v. Lindsay, 2019 ABQB 372, 95 Alta. L.R. (6th) 163, at para. 10, citing S. N. Lederman, A. W. Bryant and M. K. Fuerst, Sopinka, Lederman & Bryant: The Law of Evidence in Canada (5th ed. 2018), at §16.34). To elaborate, it addresses a basic feature of human nature: witnesses who learn, in advance of testifying, of certain accounts that are inconsistent with their own version of events, may, consciously or unconsciously, change their own evidence to conform to what they have learned or to otherwise reconcile them, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the cross‑examination they will ultimately face. In other words, “[r]evealing the evidence, defence theory, or the direction of the cross‑examination to an anticipated witness creates the risk that the witness, upon hearing the evidence, will ‘alter, modify or change what [it] would otherwise state’” (R.F. in J.J.’s case, at para. 46, citing R. v. Green, [1998] O.J. No. 3598 (QL), 1998 CarswellOnt 3820 (WL) (C.J. (Gen. Div.)), at para. 21, Re Collette and The Queen (1983), 1983 CanLII 3509 (ON SC), 6 C.C.C. (3d) 300 (Ont. H.C.), at p. 306, R. v. Latimer, 2003 CanLII 49376 (Ont. S.C.J.), at para. 27, per O’Connor J., R. v. Spence, 2011 ONSC 2406, 249 C.R.R. (2d) 64, at para. 38, and R. v. White (1999), 1999 CanLII 3695 (ON CA), 42 O.R. (3d) 760 (C.A.), at pp. 767-68).

[279]                     The concerns of J.J. and Mr. Reddick about witnesses tailoring evidence do not, contrary to arguments raised by the Crown, rely on stereotypical assumptions about the untrustworthiness of sexual assault complainants. There is no mystery or stigmatization at work here. As I say, these concerns speak more generally to a trait of human nature, and therefore to a temptation which most if not all witnesses would feel in these circumstances. While there is no right to “ambush” or “whack” a complainant with misleading or abusive cross‑examination, confronting a complainant with inconsistencies that have not previously been disclosed is a well‑established and often exceedingly effective aspect of cross‑examination used to test the complainant’s credibility. The court in D.L.B., at paras. 68‑69, reached the same conclusion, explaining that proper impeachment through cross‑examination is not the equivalent of defence by ambush but rather “an entirely legitimate and appropriate tactic in defending an accused on a criminal charge”. In many cases, advance disclosure may improperly shape complainants’ testimony, consciously or unconsciously, in a manner that cannot be readily exposed or mitigated at trial (Farah, at paras. 83‑88).

[280]                     It is true, as the Attorney General of Canada observes, that complainants often become aware of defence strategy after a mistrial has occurred or where a retrial is ordered (I.F. in J.J.’s case, at paras. 47-48; see also A.F. in J.J.’s case, at para. 120). But this comparison is not well taken. In such situations, accused persons will have had an opportunity to confront complainants before their strategy in doing so becomes apparent. And the transcript of those confrontations can be put to the complainants if their evidence changes at the retrial. Compelling advance defence disclosure before the complainant has given evidence at all is a different situation entirely.

[281]                     The majority’s third reason for finding no violation of the right to cross‑examine is that the accused will still be able to test the complainant’s evidence by comparing it to prior police statements (para. 188). The Crown similarly argued that complainants can be cross‑examined about their access to materials or participation in the application, as occurred at J.J.’s trial. Complainants can still be discredited by suggestions that they tailored their evidence or that their credibility is undermined by the knowledge they gained from reviewing the accused’s application in advance. The Crown in J.J.’s case and the complainant A.S. add that, where the complainant provided a statement to the police or testified at a preliminary hearing, any modifications in their evidence will be ripe for cross‑examination (A.F. in J.J.’s case, at para. 118; A.F. in A.S.’s case, at para. 61).

[282]                     As J.J. observes, however, preliminary inquiries are no longer available for sexual assault cases involving adults (R.F., at para. 67; An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Youth Criminal Justice Act and other Acts and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, S.C. 2019, c. 25, s. 238). And statements to the police are not always given under oath. In many cases, then, there will not be any pre‑trial sworn statements on which the accused can impeach the complainant.

[283]                     Where the application is brought before a jury trial, there is a further limit on the accused’s ability to cross‑examine the complainant on her knowledge of the defence case. Section 648(1) of the Criminal Code provides that “no information regarding any portion of the trial at which the jury is not present shall be published in any document or broadcast or transmitted in any way before the jury retires to consider its verdict”. Combined with s. 645(5), that provision has been interpreted as automatically banning publication of any pre‑trial motion that ordinarily must be dealt with in the absence of the jury, “to ensure that a jury would not be potentially exposed to, or biased by, the content or rulings of proceedings conducted by the trial judge in their absence” (R. v. Stobbe, 2011 MBQB 293, 277 Man. R. (2d) 65, at para. 13 (emphasis added)). The majority says, without explanation, that s. 648 would not prevent cross‑examination here (para. 189), but that is just not so. Again, it prohibits, inter alia, “transmi[ssion] in any way”. And if counsel could transmit that same information by questioning the complainant about a pre‑trial motion, it would defeat the purpose of a publication ban. The Crown may well therefore argue that the accused cannot cross‑examine the complainant or make closing submissions at trial about the circumstances in which the complainant received notice of the defence evidence and anticipated cross‑examination.

[284]                     To summarize, then. The advance notice and disclosure requirement, combined with the complainant’s participation, interferes with cross‑examination contrary to ss. 7 and 11(d). The requirement to provide detailed particulars means that accused persons may have to disclose frailties in the complainant’s evidence that they seek to prove by relying on the record at issue. Even witnesses seeking to give truthful testimony could subconsciously tailor their evidence. The risks go beyond the explicit fabrication of evidence, and include the subtle manipulation of testimony by a witness to address the frailties or inconsistencies disclosed in advance by the defence (R.F. in J.J.’s case, at para. 48, citing M. D. Tochor and K. D. Kilback, “Defence Disclosure: Is it Written in Stone?” (2000), 43 C.L.Q. 393). Again, and contrary to the assertions of many Attorneys General and interveners, this concern is not based on stereotypical reasoning about the untrustworthiness of sexual assault complainants, but simply a recognition of human nature. Even where the accused can establish an inconsistency against the complainant’s police statement, the complainant will be given an opportunity to reconcile competing accounts.

[285]                     And that is where the danger of wrongful conviction lies. Impeachment of a Crown witness, including impeachment by surprise, is a legitimate and valuable defence tactic, which the regime eviscerates. The comments of Rothery J. in R. v. Anderson, 2019 SKQB 304, 61 C.R. (7th) 376, are apt:

     The reality is that the defence may not even know what records may be useful on cross‑examination until the Crown has concluded the complainant’s examination‑in‑chief. The defence may not be able to prove that a record has “significant probative value” as required by s. 278.92(2)(b), or any probative value at all, in a vacuum. These procedural screening requirements eviscerate the most valuable tool available to the defence in a sexual assault trial.

 

     The nature of this offence is one that usually occurs in private, without any witnesses other than the complainant and the accused. Often, it is a case of “she said, he said” (or in this trial, “he said, he said”). The defence must be permitted to test the veracity of a complainant, within the constraints of cross‑examination as articulated in Lyttle and R.V. That is, the complainant’s questions must be relevant, and their prejudicial effect must not outweigh their probative value. The complainant’s privacy rights associated with records in the accused’s possession must give way to the accused’s rights under ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter, that is, an unencumbered cross‑examination. The balance is incontrovertibly in the accused’s favour. [paras. 21‑22]

[286]                     All this, I stress, applies where the information being disclosed (and potentially excluded) is part of the Crown’s case to meet, has probative value, and carries no inherent prejudicial effect. Full answer and defence is centrally implicated here. It is almost certain that tying the defence’s hands in this way will result in the conviction of innocent persons. And because that “threat of convicting an innocent individual strikes at the heart of the principles of fundamental justice”, “where the information contained in a record directly bears on the right to make full answer and defence”, this Court has maintained that “privacy rights must yield to avoid convicting the innocent” (Mills, at paras. 89 and 94).

(4)         All Private Records Are Presumptively Inadmissible by the Defence but Presumptively Admissible by the Crown

[287]                     The records screening regime is triggered not by the nature or content of a record, but by the identity of the party seeking to use it. The Crown can freely adduce private records in support of a conviction, without complainant participation or pre‑trial screening. It is only when the defence seeks to use the same private information to raise a reasonable doubt that it becomes “dangerous”. In this way, the records screening regime differs from the s. 276 and ss. 278.1 to 278.91 regimes, and limits the right to a fair trial.

[288]                     The s. 276 regime, of course, applies to the Crown and the accused. This logically follows from s. 276’s focus on the nature and content of records. Simply put, the nature and content of the record are the nature and content of the record; they do not change, depending on who possesses it. Not so with the records screening regime. If, as the Crown says, the nature and content of the record justify limits on admissibility, then the Crown would be similarly bound by its restrictions. Instead, the Crown is free from the strictures of disclosure and pre‑screening to use private records and digital communications between the complainant and the accused, while the accused is precluded from using the selfsame records in its defence (R.F. in J.J.’s case, at para. 17).

[289]                     As to the regime for production of third‑party records, s. 278.2(2) extends the application of the regime to “any person”, including the Crown. And so, s. 278.2(3) requires the Crown to notify the accused of any private records in the prosecutor’s possession (see Mills, at para. 103).

[290]                     In contrast, the records screening regime applies only where accused persons are in possession of records that they intend to adduce in their own defence. This limits the accused’s right to a fair trial under ss. 7 and 11(d). The majority stresses that trial fairness does not guarantee the defence “precisely the same privileges and procedures as the Crown” (para. 75), a point that no one disputes. But my colleagues fail to squarely address the questions raised: whether the fact that this regime applies only to the defence renders the trial unfair, whether the purpose of the records screening regime is undermined by its one‑sidedness, and whether this divergence from the s. 276 and ss. 278.1 to 278.91 regimes weakens the majority’s reliance on Darrach and Mills. I would answer all three questions in the affirmative. The majority’s response does not even begin to account for this glaring unfairness.

(5)         Heightened Standard of “Significant Probative Value”

[291]                     My colleagues in the majority ignore the heightened evidentiary standard imposed by s. 278.92 and its implications for full answer and defence. Indeed, they misstate it by asserting that “the right to make full answer and defence will only be violated if the accused is prevented from adducing relevant and material evidence, the probative value of which is not outweighed by its prejudicial effect” (para. 133). That is manifestly not the standard Parliament adopted; and even if it were, it would not conform to the Charter.

[292]                     While Crown evidence should be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by the prejudice which may flow from it, “[t]he presumption of the accused’s innocence leads us to strike a different balance where defence‑led evidence is concerned” (R. v. Grant, 2015 SCC 9, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 475, at para. 19). A judge may exclude evidence relevant to a defence allowed by law only where the prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value of the evidence (Grant, at para. 19, citing Seaboyer, at p. 611). The differential approach flows from the presumption of innocence and is crucial to safeguarding the right to a fair trial and the right to make full answer and defence (Seaboyer, at pp. 611‑12). It has, as such, been identified as a principle of fundamental justice (see, e.g., Seaboyer, at p. 611; R. v. Samaniego, 2020 ONCA 439, 151 O.R. (3d) 449, at para. 147, aff’d 2022 SCC 9; R. v. Pereira, 2008 BCSC 184, 247 C.C.C. (3d) 311, at para. 106). The Seaboyer standard was affirmed in Shearing, where the Court considered whether the potential prejudice of allowing the accused to cross‑examine the complainant on her diary substantially outweighed its probative value to the defence (paras. 107‑9 and 150; see also Osolin, at p. 671).

[293]                     Section 278.92(2)(b) does violence to this principle by allowing admission of evidence only where it is of “significant probative value that is not substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice”. This is not an unknown standard. In Darrach, this Court upheld the “significant probative value” standard in the s. 276 context, concluding that it serves only “to exclude evidence of trifling relevance that, even though not used to support the two forbidden inferences, would still endanger the ‘proper administration of justice’” (para. 41). But this must be understood in light of the Court’s actual reasoning. Section 11(d) was not breached in Darrach because the regime served to protect the trial from the distorting effects of evidence of prior sexual activity (paras. 41‑42). The Court held that the heightened test “serves to direct judges to the serious ramifications of the use of evidence of prior sexual activity for all parties in these cases” (para. 40).

[294]                     The same rationale does not apply mutatis mutandis to the records screening regime. While s. 276 addresses inherent “damages and disadvantages” in admitting sexual history evidence (Seaboyer, at p. 634), the records screening regime captures evidence that may well not have any distorting or damaging effect on the trial. In other words, it applies, distorting effects or not. Notably, the third‑party records regime, which uses the same definition of “record”, does not apply the same heightened standard, instead allowing the judge to order production if the records are “likely relevant” and if production is necessary to the interests of justice (Mills, at para. 139).

[295]                     Combined with the broad scope of “record” and advance notice requirement, the effect of the heightened standard for admissibility of defence evidence limits the rights to a fair trial and to make full answer and defence under ss. 7 and 11(d). The records screening regime makes all private records in the hands of the accused presumptively inadmissible. Accused persons must, in their written applications, provide sufficient particulars of the records and of how they intend to use the evidence at trial, in order for the judge to conclude the evidence is capable of meeting the heightened standard for admissibility. These detailed particulars will often include defence strategy and prior statements of the accused, and must be provided to both the Crown and complainant, before the complainant has testified and before the Crown has made out a case to meet. And because of the advance notice requirement in s. 278.93(4), the accused cannot establish the significant probative value of a record via cross‑examination. Failure by the accused to meet any of these hurdles, including the seven‑day notice requirement, could result in exclusion of relevant and probative evidence.

[296]                     The Crown in oral submissions emphasized that the accused can meet this high threshold because “in the vast majority of cases an inconsistency will have arisen before trial” (transcript, day 1, at p. 17). Counsel referred to the facts in J.J.’s case, where an inconsistency crystallized at the preliminary inquiry. Where that does not occur, the Crown said the trial judge may have discretion to hear the application after the complainant’s direct or cross‑examination.

[297]                     For three reasons, these reassurances are hollow. First, as discussed above, preliminary inquiries are no longer available for many sexual offences, meaning there will be few opportunities for an inconsistency to crystallize before trial. Secondly, the interference with cross‑examination goes beyond prior inconsistencies. For instance, a private record may disclose a motive to fabricate, and the regime would require the defence to explain in advance how they intend to use that information to show a motive. Thirdly, most defence counsel will not take the risk of waiting until mid‑trial to bring an application. They will be forced to disclose early and often, even where an inconsistency has not arisen.

C.            The Limits on the Accused’s Rights Under Sections 11(c), 11(d) and 7 Are Not Demonstrably Justified

(1)         Overview of the Section 1 Analysis

[298]                     The majority interprets the accused’s rights narrowly and balances them against the complainant’s interests to avoid any conflict, but this does not account for the obvious limits under s. 11(c) and (d) and s. 7. The only question should be whether the Crown has proven those limits are demonstrably justified.

[299]                     To constitute a reasonable limit justified under s. 1 of the Charter, the impugned provision must first have a pressing and substantial objective. Further, the means chosen to achieve that objective must be (1) rationally connected to the objective; (2) minimally impairing of the Charter right; and (3) proportionate as between the objective and the limit it imposes (including a balancing of its salutary and deleterious effects).

[300]                     Limits on the principles of fundamental justice are not easily justified, but this Court has left open that possibility (Bedford, at para. 129; Carter v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 5, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 331, at para. 95). An impugned provision “may be saved under s. 1 if the state can point to public goods or competing social interests that are themselves protected by the Charter . . . . Courts may accord deference to legislatures under s. 1 for breaches of s. 7 where, for example, the law represents a ‘complex regulatory response’ to a social problem” (Safarzadeh‑Markhali, at para. 57, citing Alberta v. Hutterian Brethren of Wilson Colony, 2009 SCC 37, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 567, at para. 37).

[301]                     For the reasons that follow, the limits on the accused’s rights occasioned by the records screening regime cannot be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. While the regime has a pressing and substantial objective, it fails at the rational connection, minimal impairment, and final balancing stages.

(2)         Pressing and Substantial Objective

[302]                     I accept the Crown’s submissions that the records screening regime has a pressing and substantial objective. That objective, as I have already mentioned and as revealed by the statutory text and the legislative history, is threefold:

1.                     ensuring that a complainant’s privacy, dignity and equality interests are considered when determining whether private records are admissible;

2.                     improving victim and community confidence in the justice system, which will likely encourage victims to report sexual crimes; and

3.                     maintaining the integrity of the trial process by refusing to admit evidence potentially rooted in myths and stereotypes which risk jeopardizing the truth‑seeking function of the trial.

(3)         Rational Connection

[303]                     To establish a rational connection, the Crown must show, on the basis of reason or logic, that there is a causal connection between the limit on the right and the objective (Carter, at para. 99, citing RJR‑MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 1995 CanLII 64 (SCC), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 199, at para. 153).

[304]                     If the records screening regime rendered all records containing personal information of the complainant presumptively inadmissible, irrespective of which party seeks to rely on them, the causal connection between the regime and its objective would be clear. Doing so might well ensure that a complainant’s privacy, dignity and equality interests are considered when determining whether private records are admissible, promote confidence in the justice system and preserve the integrity of the trial process. But that is not what the records screening regime does. Purported concerns for a complainant’s privacy, dignity and equality interests, confidence in the justice system and integrity of the trial process are cast aside when those private records are sought to be adduced by the Crown. The one‑sided nature of the obligations under the records screening regime is not, therefore, demonstrative merely of the rights‑limiting nature of the regime; it also shows that it is not rationally connected to its objective.

(4)         Minimal Impairment

[305]                     Resting on the Crown is the burden of showing that the limit on the right is reasonably tailored to the objective, such that there is no less rights‑limiting means of achieving the objective “in a real and substantial manner” (Hutterian Brethren, at para. 55). The point is that the limit on Charter rights should be confined to what is reasonably necessary to achieve the state’s object (Carter, at para. 102).

[306]                     The Attorneys General and the complainant A.S. note that the records screening regime does not absolutely exclude any evidence; rather, it merely provides procedural rules allowing a complainant to be heard. They say the complainant’s participation is limited and that any tailoring of evidence can be exposed at trial. The Crown says that the regime is minimally impairing because it (1) applies only to sexual offence prosecutions; (2) captures only private records; (3) provides flexibility to ensure protection of the accused’s rights; (4) gives complainants a voice in the process; and (5) “fills a gap but goes no further” (R.F. in A.S.’s case, at para. 76).

[307]                     These submissions severely understate the impact on the accused’s rights. They also avoid the question to be answered: whether the records screening regime, with its heavy impact on the accused’s rights under s. 11(c) and (d) and s. 7, is the least drastic means of achieving the legislative objective (Carter, at para. 103). For three reasons, it is not.

[308]                     First, the records screening regime applies to all private records, including the accused’s own communications with the complainant about the subject matter of the charge, and not to a subset of records that were created in a confidential context or wrongly fell into the accused’s hands, as in Shearing. The broad definition of “record”, combined with the heightened admissibility threshold, will result in the exclusion of defence evidence that is not prejudicial (because it does not inherently rely on myths or distort the truth‑seeking process) and is highly relevant. This is not minimally impairing of the right to full answer and defence.

[309]                     Secondly, by requiring disclosure of potential defence evidence, strategy, and lines of cross‑examination before the Crown has made out a case to meet, and by depriving the accused of establishing the relevance of that evidence based on the complainant’s testimony, the regime does not minimally impair the right to silence, the presumption of innocence, or the principle against self‑incrimination. The list of factors to be judicially balanced in deciding to admit the evidence are considered only after the evidence passes the initial screening stage. By that point, accused persons will have already given up their right to silence by providing detailed particulars, which may well impact the Crown’s witness preparation and, as a consequence, the complainant’s testimony.

[310]                     Thirdly, by mandating advance notice and disclosure to both the Crown and complainant, and by giving the complainant a role in the admissibility determination before trial, the regime allows the Crown’s key witnesses to reconcile inconsistencies and potentially alter their evidence in subtle ways that are difficult to test or expose in court. This is not minimally impairing; rather, it potentially eviscerates the effectiveness of cross‑examination, particularly in sexual assault trials where the complainant will often be the only witness. And, I repeat, it raises the near certain prospect of innocent persons being convicted.

[311]                     That last point deserves special emphasis. Rather than effecting a minimal impairment, this ham‑fisted measure is an instance of legislative overkill. It shows little to no regard for the rights of accused persons, some of whom will be not only presumptively innocent, but actually so ⸺ although, in many such cases, no longer provably so, since their sole tool for demonstrating their innocence has been statutorily neutered. And yet, there are obvious and less harmful means of achieving Parliament’s goals. A narrower regime could further the goals of empowering and protecting complainants in a real and substantial manner, while impairing the accused’s rights to a lesser extent. Without seeking to limit Parliament’s discretion, but merely to show that its objective could be achieved in Charter‑compliant ways, I note that a constitutional regime might include the following features:

1.                     “Record” would be expressly defined to include only categories of documents containing personal information relating to the complainant for which there is a high expectation of privacy, a risk to dignity, and an inherent risk of prejudice ⸺ for instance, records that the accused obtained illegally or by virtue of a position of authority and records subject to professional confidentiality obligations. Importantly, this definition would exclude the accused’s own communications. 

2.                     An admissibility voir dire would be held at the time the record becomes relevant. A voir dire would be required irrespective of which party seeks to adduce the record.

3.                     The adducing party would have to alert the court to the need for a voir dire before introducing the record.

4.                     Trial judges would consider common law rules to protect against unnecessary privacy invasions and improper reasoning.

5.                     Trial judges would have discretion to grant the witness participatory rights on the voir dire when it would be in the interests of justice.

(5)         Proportionality of Effects

[312]                     The final stage of the proportionality inquiry entails making a judgment call, requiring courts to examine the broader picture by “balanc[ing] the interests of society with those of individuals and groups” (R. v. K.R.J., 2016 SCC 31, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 906, at para. 58 (text in brackets in original), citing Oakes, at p. 139). When balancing the salutary and deleterious effects, the courts must accord the legislature a measure of deference (Carter, at para. 97).

[313]                     The deleterious effects on individual accused persons are substantial. The records screening regime severely limits the right to silence, the privilege against self‑incrimination, the presumption of innocence, full answer and defence, and the right to a fair trial. Rather than concentrating on records that inherently invoke myths and stereotypes, the records screening regime compels advance disclosure of all material for which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, with no regard to its probative value or whether it would actually advance improper myth‑based reasoning. The potential list of examples could include electronic communications from the complainant that deny the offence ever occurred, that provide proof of alibi, that indicate a motive to fabricate, that suggest an absence of memory regarding core events, or that provide an inconsistent version of the alleged incident. In the face of this, the Crown’s submission in A.S.’s case that “the impact on the accused is not substantial” because they retain their ability to adduce relevant evidence capable of raising a reasonable doubt and to meaningfully challenge the complainant’s evidence through cross‑examination cannot really be taken seriously (para. 77).

[314]                     This is all quite independent of significant deleterious effects on the criminal justice system, including increased trial complexity and delay. It is not difficult to foresee the confusion that will abound in sexual assault trials involving s. 276, ss. 278.1 to 278.91 and s. 278.92 evidence, where multiple applications will be required at different stages, all applying different standards of proof and potentially prompting separate appeals, at which the complainant may have standing to appear or to cross‑appeal. Consider the following scenario:

1.                     The accused was in a caregiver relationship with the complainant, who alleges that he sexually assaulted her multiple times over several years. As an aggravating factor, the Crown argues that he was in a position of trust as evidenced by the fact that he paid her rent. The accused seeks production of her lease documents and banking records from third parties under ss. 278.1 to 278.91, using the broader definition of “record” that now applies only to the Mills regime. 

2.                     Further, there are thousands of text messages between the complainant and the accused spanning the relevant years. Most of the messages contain mundane content, but some directly discuss the alleged offences, while others discuss prior sexual activity that was consensual. The accused brings a motion for directions to determine which text messages (or parts of messages) are captured by the narrower definition of “record” that now applies only to the ss. 278.92 to 278.94 regime. The complainant is permitted to appear on the motion to make submissions regarding her privacy interest. The motions judge rules that most messages do not meet the definition of “record” but is uncertain about 100 messages with varying degrees of sensitivity. The judge orders the accused to bring a s. 278.92 application to determine the admissibility of those messages. The accused is unsure how to provide “detailed particulars” of the text messages without disclosing their content. Since the messages are crucial to his defence and he believes the complainant will tailor her evidence if he discloses them in advance, he decides to wait until mid‑trial to bring the s. 278.92 application.

3.                     In the meantime, before trial, the accused brings a separate s. 276 application for the messages containing sexual history evidence, some of which is contained in the same messages as the evidence relevant to the charges. This requires the accused to disclose particulars of several key messages relating to his defence of consent to the Crown and complainant.

4.                     After the complainant testifies at trial, the accused files a s. 278.92 application and argues it is “in the interests of justice” to admit the records mid‑trial. The trial judge disagrees, ruling that the accused should have brought the application pre‑trial and that the accused cannot refer to the content of those statements at the trial. In the accused’s testimony, he refers to different parts of text message conversations that were found to be “mundane”. The Crown objects because other related messages were ruled inadmissible under s. 278.92 and it would be prejudicial to discuss those conversations at all. The judge adjourns to hear argument and provide further instructions.

[315]                     To be sure, this is just one illustration of the deleterious effects that this regime will visit on the criminal justice system.

[316]                     The parties supporting the records screening regime, however, assert many benefits: (1) protecting the complainants’ privacy, equality and security rights; (2) allowing complainants to participate in the admissibility process; (3) encouraging reporting of sexual offences; and (4) preventing the introduction of evidence that may distort the truth‑seeking function of the trial. I accept that the regime slightly increases the common law protections provided by Osolin and Shearing with respect to the complainants’ privacy, equality and security. It also gives complainants a formal right to participate in decisions impacting those interests. But the other purported benefits are not made out. There is no evidence that the regime increases reporting of sexual assaults. Further, there is no reason to believe that it would, since the regime is not aimed at excluding distorting or misleading evidence, allowing as it does the Crown to adduce private records without screening.

[317]                     While I am mindful of the need to accord deference to Parliament’s choice of means and legislative objective, this is not a close call. The harmful impacts and risk of wrongful convictions outweigh any potential benefits of the regime. I agree with the reasoning of other courts that have concluded the records screening regime impairs the accused’s right to silence, right to a fair trial, and right to make full answer and defence to such an extent that the Crown has not demonstrated that the law’s salutary effects outweigh its deleterious effects (see, e.g., R. v. Anderson, 2020 SKQB 11, 461 C.R.R. (2d) 128, at para. 13; D.L.B., at para. 87).

IV.         Conclusion

[318]                     I end where I began, with Seaboyer, and in particular the reasons given by McLachlin J. (as she then was) for striking down the earlier iteration of s. 276:

     I conclude that the operation of s. 276 of the Criminal Code permits the infringement of the rights enshrined in ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter. In achieving its purpose ⸺ the abolition of the outmoded, sexist‑based use of sexual conduct evidence ⸺ it overshoots the mark and renders inadmissible evidence which may be essential to the presentation of legitimate defences and hence to a fair trial. In exchange for the elimination of the possibility that the judge and jury may draw illegitimate inferences from the evidence, it exacts as a price the real risk that an innocent person may be convicted. The price is too great in relation to the benefit secured, and cannot be tolerated in a society that does not countenance in any form the conviction of the innocent. [Emphasis added; p. 625.]

[319]                     For the same reasons, I say the price of the records screening regime is too great. I earlier described the rights at stake here, while not absolute, as being of the most fundamental order that have been limited only in particular and constrained circumstances that will not necessarily arise here (and, where they do, they will be captured by those earlier restrictions ⸺ that is, by the s. 276 regime). In light of the majority’s unfortunate judgment to the contrary, I dissent.

[320]                     To be clear, I would strike down ss. 278.92 to 278.94 of the Criminal Code, with immediate effect, but only as those sections relate to the records screening regime. This would preserve the existing s. 276 regime and the definition of “record” in the ss. 278.1 to 278.91 regime. I agree with counsel for J.J. that “reading down” the provisions would not respect Parliament’s intent and could have unexpected effects on the related legislative regimes. It falls to Parliament to consider how best to bring the regime into compliance with the Charter.

 

The following are the reasons delivered by

 

                     Rowe J. —

I.               Overview

[321]                     The accused persons J.J. and Shane Reddick brought separate constitutional challenges in British Columbia and Ontario to ss. 278.92 to 278.94 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, arguing these provisions violate ss. 7, 11(c) and 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The British Columbia Supreme Court and the Ontario Superior Court agreed and struck the provisions down in whole or in part (see the Charter breach analysis in R. v. J.J., 2020 BCSC 29, and the s. 1 analysis and decision on remedy in R. v. J.J., 2020 BCSC 349; and see R. v. Reddick, 2020 ONSC 7156, 398 C.C.C. (3d) 227).

[322]                     On the merits of these appeals, I agree with Brown J. that ss. 278.92 to 278.94 of the Criminal Code are unconstitutional and therefore of no force and effect except in so far as they apply to the existing s. 276 regime. The legislation in this case restricts the fair trial rights of accused persons by placing limits on how they can conduct the cross-examination of Crown witnesses and what evidence they can introduce in support of their own defence, even if that evidence is highly probative and not prejudicial to the complainants. The screening process introduced by the legislation violates ss. 11(c) and 11(d) by requiring the accused to disclose all records relevant to their defence before the Crown has established the case to meet.

[323]                     In my view, the main issue in these appeals is that the Crown and a number of interveners invite the Court to rely on s. 7 to limit the rights protected by s. 11 of the Charter on the basis that this approach has previously been adopted in R. v. Mills, 1999 CanLII 637 (SCC), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 668, and R. v. Darrach, 2000 SCC 46, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 443. For the reasons that follow, I decline to do so.

[324]                     During these appeals, the Crown has maintained that the constitutional questions in this case, regardless of the section considered, can be resolved through an ad hoc balancing of rights, interests and values that leads to the conclusion that the impugned provisions are constitutional. The key to this argument is that a limit on trial fairness justified under s. 7 also limits fair trial rights under s. 11. In essence, the Court is urged to introduce internal limits on s. 7 rights into s. 11.

[325]                     This approach to ss. 7 and 11 does not conform with the text or purposes of those provisions or with the structure of the Charter. The scope of rights under ss. 11(c) and 11(d) is to be ascertained by the text and purposes of those provisions. Any limits on those rights must then be justified under s. 1 and not through an interpretation of s. 7. To do otherwise inverts the proper role of s. 7, which is a broad, rights-conferring provision. To construe it as a limit on other Charter rights is wrong in principle and, in this case, undermines the longstanding, fundamental right to a fair trial.

[326]                     In these reasons, I first examine the purpose and content of the constitutional right to a fair trial. Second, I outline the purpose and content of s. 7 and examine how the problems in that jurisprudence are distorting the interpretation and application of s. 11. Third, I explain why this is inappropriate.

[327]                     Finally, I set out an approach that gives proper effect to ss. 7, 11 and 1. Where a specific Charter guarantee (here, s. 11) is pleaded along with the broader guarantee in s. 7, the specific guarantee should be addressed first. If a violation of the specific Charter guarantee is found, there is no reason to proceed to s. 7. If there is no violation of the specific guarantee, or the violation is found to be justified under s. 1, the courts must then look to s. 7. This approach accords with the structure of the Charter, and with the text and purposes of the “Legal Rights” in ss. 7 to 14 and s. 1.

II.            There Is a Constitutional Right to a Fair Trial

[328]                     I begin by examining the scope of the right to a fair trial.

A.           Introduction to the Right to a Fair Trial

[329]                     The need to ensure that a criminal trial is fair has long been recognized in our justice system as key to guarding against wrongful conviction and against arbitrary deprivation of liberty. An impartial and independent justice system exists to ensure trials are fair.

[330]                     Section 11 of the Charter sets out the right of every accused person to a fair trial.

[331]                     Section 11 is part of the section of the Charter entitled “Legal Rights”, which also contains ss. 7 to 10 and 12 to 14. Section 11 sets out the rights of a person “charged with an offence”, including the right to a trial within a reasonable time (s. 11(b)), the right not to be compelled as a witness in proceedings against oneself (s. 11(c)), the presumption of innocence (s. 11(d)), the right to reasonable bail (s. 11(e)), and the right to the benefit of the lesser punishment (s. 11(i)).

[332]                     These appeals concern primarily the rights protected by s. 11(d) and, to a lesser extent, s. 11(c).

B.            Scope of Rights Protected by Section 11(d)

[333]                     Section 11(d) provides:

11 Any person charged with an offence has the right

 

. . .

 (d) to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal;

[334]                     As with all Charter rights, s. 11(d) is to be interpreted purposively (R. v. Oakes, 1986 CanLII 46 (SCC), [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, at p. 119; R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., 1985 CanLII 69 (SCC), [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, at p. 344; Hunter v. Southam Inc., 1984 CanLII 33 (SCC), [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at p. 156; Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, 1985 CanLII 81 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at p. 499; Law Society of British Columbia v. Trinity Western University, 2018 SCC 32, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 293, at paras. 178-85).

[335]                     Section 11(d) provides for interlocking substantive and procedural protections including: 1) the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty; 2) the right to fair procedures; 3) the right to cross-examine Crown witnesses without significant and unwarranted restraint; and 4) the right to silence before a case to meet is made out, which is common to ss. 11(c) and 11(d). Together, they protect the fair trial rights of the accused. I expand on these rights below.

(1)         Right to Be Presumed Innocent Until Proven Guilty

[336]                     The right to be “presumed innocent until proven guilty” appears in the text of s. 11(d).

[337]                     The presumption of innocence has long been considered a central organizing idea of a fair criminal justice system. This Court has held that the presumption of innocence is the “golden thread of criminal justice” (R. v. Lifchus, 1997 CanLII 319 (SCC), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320, at para. 27).

[338]                     The presumption of innocence means that an accused charged with an offence must be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The state bears the burden of proof (Oakes, at p. 121).

(2)         Right to Fair Procedures

[339]                     In addition to its substantive content, s. 11(d) provides for certain procedural guarantees that flow from the presumption of innocence in order to secure trial fairness. These requirements include proof of guilt according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal (Oakes, at p. 121).

(3)         Right to Cross-Examine Crown Witnesses Without Significant and Unwarranted Restraint

[340]                     Another procedural guarantee protected by s. 11(d) is the right of the accused to cross-examine adverse witnesses without significant or unwarranted restraint (R. v. Lyttle, 2004 SCC 5, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 193, at paras. 41-43). As this Court explained in R. v. Osolin, 1993 CanLII 54 (SCC), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at p. 663: “There can be no question of the importance of cross-examination. . . . It is the ultimate means of demonstrating truth and of testing veracity. . . . The opportunity to cross-examine witnesses is fundamental to providing a fair trial to an accused.”

[341]                     The right to cross-examine without significant and unwarranted restraint must “be jealously protected and broadly construed”; it can extend to protection for the “rhythm” or scope of cross-examination (Lyttle, at paras. 44 and 7). But it “must not be abused. Counsel are bound by the rules of relevancy and barred from resorting to harassment, misrepresentation, repetitiousness or, more generally, from putting questions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value” (para. 44).

(4)         Right to Silence Before a Case to Meet Is Made Out

[342]                     Finally, the presumption of innocence is closely linked to the right to silence and the protection against self-incrimination. Sections 11(c) and 11(d), as well as s. 13 of the Charter, recognize and reinforce the state’s burden to establish a criminal case against accused persons before they need respond either by testifying or by calling other evidence (Dubois v. The Queen, 1985 CanLII 10 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 350, at pp. 357-58).

C.            Scope of Rights Protected by Section 11(c)

[343]                     Section 11(c) provides:

11 Any person charged with an offence has the right

. . .

(c) not to be compelled to be a witness in proceedings against that person in respect of the offence;

[344]                     As explained above, the purpose of s. 11(c) is to protect against self-incrimination and preserve the accused’s right to silence. The accused has a right not to furnish testimonial information which the prosecutor can use in presenting the case to meet (D. M. Paciocco, “Self-Incrimination: Removing the Coffin Nails” (1989), 35 McGill L.J. 73, at p. 90; S. Coughlan and R. J. Currie, “Sections 9, 10 and 11 of the Canadian Charter”, in E. Mendes and S. Beaulac, eds., Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (5th ed. 2013), 793, at p. 845). This would apply, for example, to records that contain the accused’s own words about the subject matter of the charge. Aspects of the accused’s right to silence before a case to meet is made out are protected by both ss. 11(c) and 11(d).

D.           Permissible Limits on Sections 11(c) and 11(d)

[345]                     Having examined the content of ss. 11(c) and 11(d), it is necessary to review how these rights may be limited.

[346]                     Ordinarily, a Charter right can only be limited in one of two ways: 1) internally, through its own text; or 2) by undertaking the balancing required in s. 1 of the Charter (P. W. Hogg and W. K. Wright, Constitutional Law of Canada (5th ed. Supp.), at § 38:1; see, for example, Fleming v. Ontario, 2019 SCC 45, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 519, at para. 111). I expand on each type of limitation below.

(1)         Internal Limits: Definition of Fair Trial

[347]                     Qualifying words used in the text of the Charter are the starting point for the interpretation of the scope of Charter rights and any internal limits.

[348]                     Sections 11(c) and 11(d) have few internal limits. They apply only to persons “charged with an offence”. Section 11(c) protects an accused only from being compelled as a “witness” in “proceedings against that person in respect of the offence”, usually meaning proceedings with true penal consequences. Section 11(d) provides that the presumption of innocence ceases to operate following conviction. There is no indication in the text of either provision that they can be limited by operation of s. 7.

(2)         Section 1

[349]                     Other than internal limits that appear in the text of the Charter provisions themselves, the only other limits provided for are in s. 1 of the Charter. Section 1 reads:

Rights and freedoms in Canada

 

1 The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.

[350]                     Section 1 establishes that the only external limits applicable to Charter rights are those prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. This means that the rights protected by ss. 11(c) and 11(d) cannot be altered by statute. However, a statute may limit s. 11 rights, if those limitations meet the criteria of s. 1.

[351]                     This Court set out the proper analysis to be undertaken under s. 1 in Oakes. The Oakes analysis is rigorous. If an infringement of a Charter right is established, the onus of justifying it is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation (pp. 136-37).

[352]                     What has been offered to the Court in this case in no way conforms to the thorough examination of the legislation, its effects and consequences that is required under Oakes. Simply put, no Oakes analysis tailored to the particular operation or elements of ss. 11(c) or 11(d) was placed before the Court; that is to say, the Crown offered no s. 1 analysis that focused on exactly how an infringement of ss. 11(c) or 11(d) could be justified. This is extraordinary. The Crown not only failed to meet the high standard required by s. 1 and the Oakes test; rather it denied that it needed to do so. The majority has adopted a similar view.

III.         A Limit on Section 11 Based on Section 7 Does Not Conform Either to the Architecture of the Charter or to the Purposes of Those Provisions, or Section 1

[353]                     Instead of relying on the permissible limits on s. 11 rights described above, the Crown submitted that this case can be resolved under s. 7 and that the s. 7 finding would also be determinative of the s. 11 issues.

[354]                     There is simply no foundation for an analytical approach whereby ss. 11(c) and 11(d) rights can be limited by reference to internal limits in s. 7. This involves a grave distortion of s. 7, which is a broad, rights-conferring provision. Instead, s. 7 is used here as a limit on other constitutional rights. This departs fundamentally from the view that s. 7 is broader than the other “Legal Rights” in ss. 8 to 14, such that it can supplement those rights.

[355]                     Yet, the Crown urges this Court to find that, based on our jurisprudence, s. 7 can be used to undercut other “Legal Rights”. To address this argument it is necessary to review s. 7 in some detail.

[356]                     Below I review the content of s. 7 and how its inconsistent interpretation has given rise to doctrinal difficulties that the Court has on occasion introduced into the interpretation of s. 11. As I explain, this Court’s jurisprudence on defining the scope and proper application of s. 7 is inconsistent. The Court has been unclear on how to identify and define the principles of fundamental justice. There is no clear guidance on how to undertake internal balancing in s. 7, nor even as to whether such balancing is appropriate. I then review how those uncertainties are being introduced into s. 11. Finally, I explain why such an approach constitutes a fundamental undermining of the right to a fair trial and, in so doing, departs from the text and architecture of the Charter. 

A.           Section 7

[357]                     Section 7 provides that:

7 Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.

[358]                     This Court described the purpose of s. 7 in Gosselin v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2002 SCC 84, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 429, at para. 77:

. . . the dominant strand of jurisprudence on s. 7 sees its purpose as guarding against [those] deprivation[s] of life, liberty and security of the person . . . “that occur as a result of an individual’s interaction with the justice system and its administration”: New Brunswick (Minister of Health and Community Services) v. G. (J.), 1999 CanLII 653 (SCC), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 46, at para. 65. “[T]he justice system and its administration” refers to “the state’s conduct in the course of enforcing and securing compliance with the law” (G. (J.), at para. 65).

[359]                     In order to determine whether there is a violation of s. 7, the Court applies a three-step analysis (R. v. White, 1999 CanLII 689 (SCC), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 417, at para. 38):

1)      Is there a real or imminent deprivation of life, liberty, security of the person, or a combination of these interests?

2)      If so, one must identify and define the relevant principles of fundamental justice.

3)      Is the deprivation in accordance with the relevant principle or principles of fundamental justice?

[360]                     Although this test is well-established, applying it in practice has proven difficult. The reach of s. 7 can extend beyond the administration of justice, which may “be implicated in a variety of circumstances” (Gosselin, at para. 78), and its boundaries remain unsettled. For this reason, s. 7 has been described by commentators as “elusiv[e]” and “mysterious” (T. Lipton, “All Charter Rights Are Equal, But Some Are More Equal than Others” (2010), 52 S.C.L.R. (2d) 449, at p. 449).

[361]                     Unlike ss. 11(c) and 11(d), s. 7 contains significant internal limits. Once a deprivation of life, liberty or personal security is established, it can nonetheless be shown that the deprivation is in accordance with the “principles of fundamental justice”. It is at this stage of the analysis where many difficulties arise.

B.            The Content of the Principles of Fundamental Justice in Section 7

[362]                     The first difficulty with interpreting s. 7 is in giving concrete meaning to the “principles of fundamental justice”. The foundational case on the meaning of s. 7 remains Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act. At p. 509, this Court commented that the interpretation of s. 7 and all Charter rights should preserve the opportunity for “growth, development and adjustment to changing societal needs” to ensure the Charter continues to be a “living tree” that is capable of responding to the needs of the moment. This Court stated that the principles of fundamental justice “cannot be given any exhaustive content or simple enumerative definition, but will take on concrete meaning as the courts address alleged violations of s. 7” (p. 513).

(1)         The Principles of Fundamental Justice Have Substantive and Not Only Procedural Content

[363]                     In Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, the Court was asked whether the “principles of fundamental justice” have both procedural and substantive content. Some extrinsic evidence indicated that when the Charter was drafted, the intended meaning of the term “principles of fundamental justice” was similar to that connoted by the phrase “procedural due process” (Minutes of the Proceedings and Evidence of the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and of the House of Commons on the Constitution of Canada, No. 46, 1st Sess., 32nd Parl., January 27, 1981, at pp. 32 and 42, and pp. 33-36 (Mr. Strayer, Assistant Deputy Minister, Public Law); see also the evidence of the Minister of Justice, the Hon. J. Chrétien, at p. 43). Nonetheless, the Court adopted a broad definition of the principles of fundamental justice and decided that they include not only procedural protections, but also substantive ones (Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, at pp. 498-500). 

[364]                     This expansive approach to the principles of fundamental justice gave rise to considerable uncertainty; it has contributed to s. 7 jurisprudence marked by indeterminacy and an ongoing lack of doctrinal clarity (see, for example, N. R. Hasan, “Three Theories of ‘Principles of Fundamental Justice’” (2013), 63 S.C.L.R. (2d) 339, at p. 341).

(2)         Difficulties Identifying the Principles of Fundamental Justice

[365]                     One consequence of Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act is persistent incoherence in identifying the principles of fundamental justice.

[366]                     For years after Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, there was no settled methodology for identifying the principles of fundamental justice. Many principles of fundamental justice that were recognized were stated in broad generalizations which risked “transform[ing] s. 7 into a vehicle for policy adjudication” (Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law v. Canada (Attorney General), 2004 SCC 4, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 76, at para. 9).

[367]                     With time, it became clear that a greater degree of clarity with respect to the meaning of the principles of fundamental justice was needed for the interpretation of s. 7 to be workable in practice. This Court sought to provide greater structure in Rodriguez v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 1993 CanLII 75 (SCC), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 519, at pp. 591-92, and subsequently in R. v. Malmo-Levine, 2003 SCC 74, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 571, at para. 113. The Court finally settled on the current criteria for identifying a principle of fundamental justice in Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law, at para. 8. The Court adopted the following three-pronged test:

Jurisprudence on s. 7 has established that a “principle of fundamental justice” must fulfill three criteria: R. v. Malmo-Levine, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 571, 2003 SCC 74, at para. 113. First, it must be a legal principle. This serves two purposes. First, it “provides meaningful content for the s. 7 guarantee”; second, it avoids the “adjudication of policy matters”: Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, 1985 CanLII 81 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at p. 503. Second, there must be sufficient consensus that the alleged principle is “vital or fundamental to our societal notion of justice”: Rodriguez v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 1993 CanLII 75 (SCC), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 519, at p. 590. The principles of fundamental justice are the shared assumptions upon which our system of justice is grounded. They find their meaning in the cases and traditions that have long detailed the basic norms for how the state deals with its citizens. Society views them as essential to the administration of justice. Third, the alleged principle must be capable of being identified with precision and applied to situations in a manner that yields predictable results. Examples of principles of fundamental justice that meet all three requirements include the need for a guilty mind and for reasonably clear laws. [Emphasis added.]

[368]                     Nonetheless, the definition of the principles of fundamental justice remains malleable, particularly given the need to identify a “sufficient consensus” about the importance of a legal principle.

[369]                     The consequences and potentially idiosyncratic applications of an unsettled definition of the principles of fundamental justice can readily be seen in this case.

[370]                     For example, the majority continues to rely on the unexplained assertions in Mills and Darrach that “protecting the security and privacy of witnesses” qualifies as a principle of fundamental justice (para. 120). Mills and Darrach claim to rely on R. v. Seaboyer, 1991 CanLII 76 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577 (Mills, at para. 72; Darrach, at para. 25). Yet, Seaboyer does not support this proposition. In that case, McLachlin J. (as she then was) noted that the goals of an earlier version of s. 276 of the Criminal Code — the avoidance of unprobative and misleading evidence, the encouraging of reporting and the protection of the security and privacy of the witnesses — “conform to our fundamental conceptions of justice” (p. 606). These goals were not themselves recognized as principles of fundamental justice. Moreover, Seaboyer pre-dates the test set out in Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law. It is doubtful that this test would be met if it were applied to the goals of “protecting the security and privacy of witnesses”. These aims, while laudable, are neither legal principles, nor sufficiently precise to be principles of fundamental justice.

[371]                     The majority also refers to “dignity” and “equality”, even where neither have ever been recognized as principles of fundamental justice. The role these concepts play in the majority’s reasoning is unclear. I would note, parenthetically, that the recognition of “equality” as a principle of fundamental justice under s. 7 would have far reaching implications that extend far beyond the matters at issue in this case.

[372]                     Another difficulty with the malleable definition of the “principles of fundamental justice” is that it is not always clear in what circumstances “societal interests” may be relevant to identifying principles of fundamental justice. “Societal interests” are considered in more depth below, in relation to internal balancing within s. 7. However, a different (and preliminary) question is whether any societal interests are themselves principles of fundamental justice. There remains no settled answer to this question, as among others.

C.            How Do the Principles of Fundamental Justice Operate to Limit Section 7 Rights?

(1)         The Methodological Approach for How the Principles of Fundamental Justice Operate to Limit Section 7 Rights Is Inconsistent

[373]                     There is a lack of coherence not only in the definition of the principles of fundamental justice, but also in the methodology for how principles of fundamental justice are balanced with competing considerations to arrive at the scope of s. 7 rights, or whether such a balancing is appropriate. 

[374]                     The Court has on occasion dealt with s. 7 cases where one or more parties argued that finding a violation of s. 7 would undermine the rights or interests of third parties or societal interests. In such circumstances, the Court has previously considered that all of these competing considerations should be internally balanced under s. 7, to define them so they do not conflict with each other (Mills, at para. 21; Seaboyer, at pp. 603-4).

[375]                     When engaging in an internal balancing under s. 7, the Court has occasionally categorized competing considerations as Charter rights, Charter values, and societal interests, but has not adopted a systematic or consistent approach to how these are to be weighed against one another, or even whether the considerations applicable to each category are different. It is not clear: 1) how Charter values and societal interests as opposed to Charter rights are defined; 2) whether these rights, values or interests must engage s. 7 or at least amount to principles of fundamental justice in order to be part of the balancing in s. 7; or 3) in the event of conflict between rights, interests and values, how one should decide which consideration prevails.

[376]                     The lack of a sound methodology is evident when one considers how the Court has dealt with conflicts between Charter rights, Charter values (an open and malleable category) and societal interests (an even more open and more malleable category).

(a)           One Party’s Charter Rights vs. Other Charter Rights

[377]                     It is argued by the Crown and a number of interveners that this case engages the Charter rights of multiple persons, including the accused and complainants — referred to by counsel for A.S. in the hearing as “three-dimensional” Charter rights. (One wonders whether such metaphors do more to obscure than illuminate doctrinal questions.) It is submitted, on this basis, that all of these competing rights should be reconciled under s. 7.

[378]                     The Court has determined that where giving effect to a s. 7 right may conflict with a competing Charter right of another party, courts should engage in a “balancing” approach as set out in Mills. The majority of the Court in that case said, at para. 21:

As this Court’s decision in Dagenais, supra, makes clear, Charter rights must be examined in a contextual manner to resolve conflicts between them. Therefore, unlike s. 1 balancing, where societal interests are sometimes allowed to override Charter rights, under s. 7 rights must be defined so that they do not conflict with each other. The rights of full answer and defence, and privacy, must be defined in light of each other, and both must be defined in light of the equality provisions of s. 15.

[379]                     Mills concerned the third party records regime, which engaged the complainant’s s. 8 right against unreasonable search and seizure because the Criminal Code provisions at issue authorized the seizure of the complainant’s records. The Court noted, at para. 62, that both the complainant’s s. 8 rights and the accused’s s. 7 right to make full answer and defence were engaged and that “both of these rights are instances of the ‘principles of fundamental justice’ enshrined in s. 7”.

[380]                     The Court in Mills relied on Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., 1994 CanLII 39 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835, despite the fact that Dagenais did not involve s. 7. Instead, in that case, the Court relied on the Charter values of a fair trial and freedom of expression to interpret the common law rule governing publication bans. Mills interpreted Dagenais to suggest that Charter rights considered under s. 7 “must be examined in a contextual manner to resolve conflicts between them [and] must be defined so that they do not conflict with each other” (para. 21).

[381]                     However, subsequent decisions of the Court confirm that Dagenais did not concern balancing under s. 7, and in fact “incorporates the essence of s. 1 of the Charter and the Oakes test” (R. v. Mentuck, 2001 SCC 76, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 442, at para. 27; see also R. v. N.S., 2012 SCC 72, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 726, at para. 35). These pronouncements are consistent with this Court’s decision in Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, 2013 SCC 72, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1101, at paras. 123 and 125, and Carter v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 5, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 331, at paras. 79-80, which confirm that s. 7 should focus on those who allege that they have been deprived of life, liberty or security of the person in a manner that does not accord with the principles of fundamental justice.

[382]                     In fact, this Court has asserted on multiple occasions that competing rights should be balanced under s. 1 of the Charter — a framework “especially well suited to the task of balancing” (R. v. Keegstra, 1990 CanLII 24 (SCC), [1990] 3 S.C.R. 697, at pp. 733-34, referring to Edmonton Journal v. Alberta (Attorney General), 1989 CanLII 20 (SCC), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1326, per Wilson J., concurring; see also B. (R.) v. Children’s Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto, 1995 CanLII 115 (SCC), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 315, at pp. 383-84; Ross v. New Brunswick School District No. 15, 1996 CanLII 237 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 825, at paras. 73-75; Harvey v. New Brunswick (Attorney General), 1996 CanLII 163 (SCC), [1996] 2 S.C.R. 876, at para. 30; Multani v. Commission scolaire Marguerite‑Bourgeoys, 2006 SCC 6, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 256, at para. 26; Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission) v. Whatcott, 2013 SCC 11, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 467, at para. 154; R. v. Sharpe, 2001 SCC 2, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45, at para. 154, per L’Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier and Bastarache JJ., concurring; Trinity Western University v. British Columbia College of Teachers, 2001 SCC 31, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 772, at para. 94, per L’Heureux-Dubé J., dissenting; Law Society of British Columbia, at para. 188, per Rowe J., concurring). As these precedents demonstrate, the Mills approach is a clear outlier in prescribing that Charter rights be “defined so that they do not conflict with each other” (para. 21).

[383]                     In any event, the majority does not explain why Mills is relevant in this case. Mills did not find that balancing was required merely because the records in that case engaged the complainant’s privacy interest. In that case the privacy interest was a Charter-protected right that was also an instance of the principles of fundamental justice. As the majority acknowledges (at para. 119), the complainants’ Charter rights are not engaged in this case. It is therefore not clear why or how the framework for “analyzing multiple Charter breaches” applies (para. 121; see also para. 115).

(b)         Charter Rights vs. Charter Values

[384]                     The Crown argues that even if it cannot be found that complainants’ Charter rights are engaged, courts can balance “Charter values” because they are relevant to the scope of the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7.

[385]                     The concept of “Charter values” originated in civil and administrative law cases, where Charter rights are not engaged, but the subject matter is similar to cases to which the Charter applies, for example defamation and free speech (see RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd., 1986 CanLII 5 (SCC), [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573, at p. 603; R. v. Salituro, 1991 CanLII 17 (SCC), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 654, at p. 675; Dagenais, at p. 876; Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto, 1995 CanLII 59 (SCC), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130, at paras. 91-98; M. (A.) v. Ryan, 1997 CanLII 403 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 157, at paras. 22-23; WIC Radio Ltd. v. Simpson, 2008 SCC 40, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 420, at paras. 2 and 16; Grant v. Torstar Corp., 2009 SCC 61, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 640, at paras. 44 and 46; Law Society of British Columbia, at para. 41). Since then, Charter values have been applied to develop the common law, as a tool of statutory interpretation, and as a constraint on administrative discretion (see M. Horner, “Charter Values: The Uncanny Valley of Canadian Constitutionalism” (2014), 67 S.C.L.R. (2d) 361, at pp. 364, 367 and 371).

[386]                     As noted, Charter values were first used in RWDSU to interpret the common law, rather than to affect internal balancing under s. 7. However, in Darrach, at para. 25, the Court appeared to introduce Charter values into the internal “balancing” in s. 7 when it relied on the notion of “rights or values” articulated in Mills, at paras. 61, 72 and 89, to limit the accused’s fair trial rights. The majority follows this approach while also adding into the mix other amorphous values like dignity and equality. How these should be considered is unclear.

[387]                     When introduced into the principles of fundamental justice, Charter values are used to limit the accused’s Charter rights without a clear basis being set out for doing so. As the Ontario Court of Appeal recently commented in McKitty v. Hayani, 2019 ONCA 805, 439 D.L.R. (4th) 504, at para. 90: “Charter values, unlike Charter rights, are not taken from a canonical text. There is no methodology to guide the degree of abstraction at which they are formulated, or to resolve claims of priority when they conflict.” Charter rights are constrained by their text and purposes. Values are potentially boundless, with few indications of their parameters. As I have noted in Law Society of British Columbia, at paras. 171-72, weighing values against rights is a subjective exercise that lends itself to conclusory reasoning. This lack of clarity is an impediment to applying a structured and consistent approach to adjudicating Charter claims.

[388]                     A finding that values supersede rights risks arbitrarily undermining those rights and poses serious risks to the rule of law. That is the case here. The majority advances somewhat abstract justifications for serious procedural limitations on fair trial rights. The majority states that “highly private” records implicate complainants’ “privacy and dignity” and “have the potential to engage truth-distorting myths” (paras. 162-63). These concerns are formulated at a very high level of generality. The majority does not specify the weight these considerations should be given in the s. 7 balancing, and why.

[389]                     It is beyond the scope of this case to consider what role Charter values should be accorded in civil and administrative proceedings. However, a proper and careful reading of this Court’s jurisprudence leads to the conclusion that Charter values have no place in the analysis of constitutional issues under s. 7. Charter values are the kinds of “moral claims” referred to in Carter, at paras. 79-81 (see also Bedford, at para. 125), that should properly be considered under s. 1. In saying this, I do not say that the result in Darrach is incorrect. Rather, I make the simple point that the methodology employed under the analysis in s. 7 should be clear, transparent and consistent with the structure of the Charter. 

(c)           Charter Rights vs. Societal Interests

[390]                     Another concept the Court has referred to in delineating the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7 is that of “societal interests”.

[391]                     The place of “societal interests” in the s. 7 balancing analysis has been a controversial subject since the earliest days of the Charter. The Court has been inconsistent as to how societal interests are weighed within s. 7 (see, in particular, Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada (Director of Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices Commission), 1990 CanLII 135 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 425; R. v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc., 1991 CanLII 39 (SCC), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 154; R. v. Swain, 1991 CanLII 104 (SCC), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 933; Rodriguez), attracting criticism for analytical instability and a lack of coherence. Different approaches have been taken by the Court and described in the literature (see T. J. Singleton, “The Principles of Fundamental Justice, Societal Interests and Section 1 of the Charter” (1995), 74 Can. Bar Rev. 446, at pp. 449 and 473; Lipton, at pp. 452-53).

[392]                     One approach holds that “societal interests” should not be considered at all when determining whether there has been a rights violation under s. 7. This was the Court’s view in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, at p. 517. However, if a violation of s. 7 is found, “societal interests” may be considered in the subsequent balancing exercise under s. 1 (R. v. Morgentaler, 1988 CanLII 90 (SCC), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 30; Carter, at paras. 79-80 and 95; R. v. Brown, 2022 SCC 18, at para. 70; Singleton, at p. 448; Lipton, at pp. 452-53 and 479).

[393]                     A second approach holds that, when considering whether there is a deprivation of “life, liberty and security of the person” in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice, those principles should only be balanced against other principles of fundamental justice. Any “other interests” should be considered under s. 1. Mills is widely considered to be an example of this approach, assuming, as discussed above, the benefits of the legislation referenced there legitimately qualified as principles of fundamental justice (see also R. v. Jarvis, 2002 SCC 73, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 757, at para. 68; Lipton, at p. 478).

[394]                     A third approach holds that “societal interests”, whether principles of fundamental justice or not, may be considered when delineating the scope of the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7. Examples of “societal interests” may include administrative efficiency or the effectiveness of law enforcement. Often there is no further balancing under s. 1 (see R. v. Beare, 1988 CanLII 126 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 387, at pp. 402-3; R. v. Hebert, 1990 CanLII 118 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151, at p. 180; Kindler v. Canada (Minister of Justice), 1991 CanLII 78 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 779, at pp. 833 and 852-54; Chiarelli v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), 1992 CanLII 87 (SCC), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 711, at p. 733; Malmo‑Levine, at paras. 98-99; R. v. Demers, 2004 SCC 46, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 489, at para. 45; Charkaoui v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 SCC 9, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 350, at paras. 20 and 63; R. v. Singh, 2007 SCC 48, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 405, at paras. 45-47; Singleton, at p. 448; Lipton, at p. 477).

[395]                     A fourth approach holds that “societal interests” should be balanced against the s. 7 right itself (that is liberty, life, or personal security) and not just the principle of fundamental justice that sets boundaries on the application of the right (see Cunningham v. Canada, 1993 CanLII 139 (SCC), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 143, at pp. 151-52; Lipton, at pp. 452-53 and 476).

[396]                     Finally, the Court adopted a fifth approach in Bedford. When considering whether there has been a violation under s. 7 and the principles of overbreadth, arbitrariness or gross disproportionality are at issue, it should be determined whether the effect on an individual’s life, liberty or personal security is in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice in a particular case. Whether such a deprivation is justified in light of the “overarching public goal” of the legislation may be considered under s. 1 (Bedford, at paras. 124-29; R. v. Smith, 2015 SCC 34, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 602, at para. 29).

[397]                     In Carter, at paras. 79-80, the Court responded to longstanding and continuing criticism of its various approaches to “societal interests” in s. 7 by affirming that societal interests should only be considered under s. 1. The Court explicitly stated that when “determining whether the deprivation of life, liberty and security of the person is in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7, courts are not concerned with competing social interests or public benefits conferred by the impugned law” (para. 79 (emphasis added)). Similarly, in Brown, our Court held that “[t]he equality and dignity interests of women and children . . . are appropriately understood as justification for the infringement by the state. . . . [T]he equality, dignity and security interests of vulnerable groups informed the overarching social policy goals of Parliament; they are best considered under s. 1” (para. 70 (emphasis added)).

[398]                     In their reasons, the majority seeks to distinguish Carter on the basis that they are not “balancing ‘competing moral claims’ but rather assessing the fairness of trial procedures” (para. 122, citing Carter, at para. 79). With respect, the majority is balancing the s. 11(d) rights of accused persons with “the privacy, dignity, and equality interests of complainants” (para. 119 (emphasis added)) to define the parameters of the accused’s entitlement to trial fairness under s. 7.

[399]                     In sum, in the present case, the Court is being asked to return to the method adopted in the specific context arising in Darrach and Mills, which does not otherwise conform to the Court’s recent pronouncements and, as explained below, is inconsistent with the structure of the Charter. These cases cannot support the propositions for which they are advanced by the Crown.

(2)         Conclusions on Section 7

[400]                     The ambiguities and lack of consistent structure in the Court’s s. 7 jurisprudence make it a grab-bag of “rights, values, and societal interests” — unclear and amorphous concepts of uncertain legal origin and status that can be chosen, à la carte, by a decision maker to arrive at a given result. The outcomes provide little certainty about the law for citizens and little predictability for litigants. This opens the door widely to conclusory decision-making.

D.           The Principles of Fundamental Justice Under Section 7 Are Being Relied Upon to Limit Section 11

(1)         How Permissible Internal Limits on Section 7 Rights Are Being Relied on to Introduce Limitations Into Section 11

[401]                     Not only are there difficulties in the Court’s s. 7 jurisprudence, the Court is now being invited to rely on the content of s. 7 to limit the rights protected by s. 11.

[402]                     Protections under s. 7 have been held to overlap with protections under ss. 11(c) and (d). For example, s. 7 rights that are also protected under s. 11 include:

-         The right of the accused to make full answer and defence (Dersch v. Canada (Attorney General), 1990 CanLII 3820 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1505, at p. 1514; R. v. Stinchcombe, 1991 CanLII 45 (SCC), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, at p. 336; R. v. Carosella, 1997 CanLII 402 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 80, at para. 29; R. v. McClure, 2001 SCC 14, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 445, at para. 3; Seaboyer);

-         The right of the accused to be presumed innocent until proven guilty (R. v. Pearson, 1992 CanLII 52 (SCC), [1992] 3 S.C.R. 665, at p. 682);

-         The right of the accused to cross-examine Crown witnesses without significant and unwarranted restraint (Lyttle, at para. 43);

-         The right of the accused to call evidence in their own defence (Seaboyer; R. v. Rose, 1998 CanLII 768 (SCC), [1998] 3 S.C.R. 262, at para. 2);

-         The right of the accused to fair procedures (R. v. Levogiannis, 1993 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 475; Rose, at para. 99; Dersch, at pp. 1514-17);

-         The right of the accused to take a completely adversarial stance to the prosecution (Stinchcombe, at p. 333).

[403]                     There are three ways through which limits in s. 7 are introduced into s. 11, all of which rely on similar theoretical underpinnings and all three of which the majority relies on here.

[404]                     The first approach finds that ss. 11(c) and 11(d) protect rights that illustrate principles of fundamental justice (Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, at p. 502), and therefore these may be balanced against other considerations under s. 7. When s. 7 is given priority in the analysis, it subsumes ss. 11(c) and 11(d) and the latter can be limited without a s. 1 analysis. This was the approach adopted in Mills and subsequently, in Darrach.

[405]                     The second approach is somewhat similar to the first. However, ss. 11(c) and 11(d) are not balanced against other principles of fundamental justice under s. 7, but are themselves defined following consideration of other interests because they are “inextricably intertwined” with s. 7 (Seaboyer, at p. 603). This analysis can be seen in Seaboyer, where McLachlin J. stated for the majority, at pp. 603-4, that “[t]he principles of fundamental justice reflect a spectrum of interests, from the rights of the accused to broader societal concerns”, and implied that the content of ss. 7 and 11(d) is equivalent and ascertained by looking to the scope of s. 7.

[406]                     The third approach holds that, because it is so closely related to s. 7, the definition of “fairness” in the s. 11(d) right to a fair trial includes considerations of the interests of the state and other parties. This methodology is exemplified by the reasons of Chief Justice McLachlin in R. v. Find, 2001 SCC 32, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 863, where she stated, at para. 28:

The ultimate requirement of a system of jury selection is that it results in a fair trial. A fair trial, however, should not be confused with a perfect trial, or the most advantageous trial possible from the accused’s perspective. As I stated in R. v. O’Connor, 1995 CanLII 51 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, at para. 193, “[w]hat constitutes a fair trial takes into account not only the perspective of the accused, but the practical limits of the system of justice and the lawful interests of others involved in the process. . . . What the law demands is not perfect justice, but fundamentally fair justice”. See also R. v. Carosella, 1997 CanLII 402 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 80, at para. 72; R. v. Lyons, 1987 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at p. 362; R. v. Harrer, 1995 CanLII 70 (SCC), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 562, at para. 14. At the same time, occasional injustice cannot be accepted as the price of efficiency: M. (A.) v. Ryan, 1997 CanLII 403 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 157, at para. 32; R. v. Leipert, 1997 CanLII 367 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 281.

[407]                     All of the above approaches have common features, which have at their core the conflation of s. 7 with the other “Legal Rights” in ss. 8 to 14 and the tendency to channel the entire constitutional analysis through s. 7. Such an analysis operates almost entirely outside the constitutional text, structure, and purposes of the various provisions.

[408]                     Although the majority states that they are not importing the limits of s. 7 into s. 11 in this case, that is how their analysis proceeds. Notably, the majority defines the right to a fair trial by reference to the perspectives of the accused, the complainant, the community and the criminal justice system at large (paras. 121 and 125). However, the right to a fair trial under s. 11(d) is one that appertains to the accused only. I do not see how this right of the accused can be limited by consideration of societal interests unless it is through the vehicle of the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7. I note again that, having regard to the architecture of the Charter, the proper methodology by which to have regard to such societal considerations is under s. 1 and not by using s. 7 as a mechanism to limit rights under s. 11.

(2)         Confusion Whether to Proceed First Under the Specific (Section 11) or the General (Section 7)

[409]                     Because of the lack of coherence in the approach to defining ss. 7 and 11, when courts are presented with a specific case, there is no clear methodology for choosing to deal with the general (s. 7) or the specific (s. 11) right first, or to deal with one but not the other.

[410]                     The Court’s approach to this issue has been inconsistent. In Canada (Attorney General) v. Whaling, 2014 SCC 20, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 392, at para. 76, the Court favoured proceeding with the specific right first, yet some cases continue to proceed ad hoc. Sometimes cases proceed under the general right — s. 7 — first (see, for example, R. v. Cawthorne, 2016 SCC 32, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 983, at para. 35). Sometimes, the Court’s approach varies within the same case. For example, in R. v. St-Onge Lamoureux, 2012 SCC 57, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 187, the Court dealt with some claims under s. 7 and some claims under s. 11 on the basis that some rights “most directly engage[d]” one section or the other (para. 125). This also appears to have been the approach followed in R. v. Boutilier, 2017 SCC 64, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 936, and R. v. Morrison, 2019 SCC 15, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 3.

[411]                     The lack of a settled approach is problematic, because by choosing to proceed under one or the other section, one may arrive at inconsistent results, or, as seen above, import irrelevant considerations from one section into another. For example, here the majority asserts (without explanation) that s. 7 and s. 11(d) are “co-extensive” (paras. 113-14), while giving primacy to s. 7 and avoiding s. 1 altogether.

(3)         The Specific Example of Evidence in Which a Complainant Has a Reasonable Expectation of Privacy

[412]                     The Court has a line of jurisprudence addressing situations that arise when an accused wishes to obtain or use evidence in which a complainant has a reasonable expectation of privacy and where restrictions on the use of this evidence are alleged to affect the accused’s fair trial rights. Due to their particular difficulty, these cases tend to demonstrate all of the above methodological problems, often at the same time. They illustrate the gradual blending of Charter rights, Charter values and societal interests within the principles of fundamental justice and how they have come to influence the interpretation of s. 11 and impose limits on its scope that are not found in its text and are not justified under the rigorous Oakes analysis of s. 1.

[413]                     In Seaboyer, the Court addressed Parliament’s first effort to regulate the use of evidence of complainants’ prior sexual history under s. 276 of the Criminal Code. Complainants’ privacy and security rights were not directly engaged by the legislation, but the arguments made in favour of the legislation contended that these goals needed to be considered when determining whether the legislation violated s. 7. As described above, McLachlin J. imported consideration of societal interests into s. 7 when she stated on behalf of the majority, at pp. 603-4:

A final point must be made on the ambit of s. 7 of the Charter. It has been suggested that s. 7 should be viewed as concerned with the interest of complainants as a class to security of person and to equal benefit of the law as guaranteed by ss. 15 and 28 of the Charter: Yola Althea Grant, “The Penetration of the Rape Shield: R. v. Seaboyer and R. v. Gayme in the Ontario Court of Appeal” (1989-1990), 3 C.J.W.L. 592, at p. 600. Such an approach is consistent with the view that s. 7 reflects a variety of societal and individual interests.

Crucially, McLachlin J. finished that statement by writing: “However, all proponents in this case concede that a measure which denies the accused the right to present a full and fair defence would violate s. 7 in any event” (p. 604).

[414]                     In R. v. O’Connor, 1995 CanLII 51 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, the Court considered the common law rules governing production of third party records in sexual assault trials. In dissent on this issue, L’Heureux-Dubé J. opined that “values that are fundamental to our common law” are the basis for the “principles of fundamental justice” and that complainants’ privacy and security of the person are such principles (paras. 61 and 113). She would have found that these Charter values should have been balanced against the accused’s right to a fair trial within s. 7.

[415]                     I note, parenthetically, that even L’Heureux-Dubé J.’s O’Connor dissent, while finding that complainants’ privacy and security may be weighed against the accused’s right to a fair trial, recognized that some documents are exempt from this weighing because they are necessary for the accused to defend against the subject matter of the charge. L’Heureux-Dubé J. commented that “witnesses have a right to privacy in relation to private documents and records (i.e. documents and records in which they hold a reasonable expectation of privacy) which are not a part of the Crown’s ‘case to meet’ against the accused” (para. 130 (emphasis added)). This crucial point has been eliminated in ss. 278.92 to 278.94. In this case the majority appears to suggest that introducing information relating to the subject matter of the charge is merely a tactical burden, rather than crucial to determining the truth of the matters in issue (paras. 66-67, 79 and 151-63).

[416]                     In Mills, the privacy and security interests of complainants were elevated to the status of principles of fundamental justice to be balanced against the right to a fair trial within s. 7 (para. 62). However, it should not be overlooked that the Court in Mills also considered that the legislation directly engaged complainants’ Charter rights because there was a seizure of records under s. 8. The privacy and security of complainants in that case were not merely Charter values or societal interests.

[417]                     In Darrach, the Court blended consideration of Charter rights and Charter values under the principles of fundamental justice. In that case, the legislation did not directly engage any of the complainant’s Charter rights. Nonetheless, the Court concluded, at para. 25, that “[i]n Seaboyer, the Court found that the principles of fundamental justice include the three purposes of s. 276 identified above: protecting the integrity of the trial by excluding evidence that is misleading, protecting the rights of the accused, as well as encouraging the reporting of sexual violence and protecting ‘the security and privacy of the witnesses’ (p. 606). This was affirmed in Mills, supra, at para. 72.” The Court reached this finding despite the distinctions between the status of complainants’ rights and interests in those prior cases. The holding in Darrach that Charter values are relevant to internal balancing under s. 7 finds no support in Mills or Seaboyer, on a careful reading of those cases.

[418]                     As well, Darrach blended s. 7 and ss. 11(c) and 11(d). At para. 23, the Court explained:

In R. v. Mills, 1999 CanLII 637 (SCC), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 668, the Court dealt with a claim that s. 11(d) was violated in combination with s. 7, and the Court analysed the issues under the rubric of s. 7 on the grounds that the fair trial specifically protected by s. 11(d) was itself a principle of fundamental justice under s. 7. In R. v. White, 1999 CanLII 689 (SCC), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 417, at paras. 40 and 44, Iacobucci J. described s. 11(c) as a procedural protection that underlies the principle against self-incrimination, which is also a principle of fundamental justice under s. 7. In both cases, the Court analysed the rights involved in the context of s. 7. [Emphasis added.]

[419]                     The Court in Darrach then proceeded to import the limits of s. 7 into ss. 11(c) and 11(d) so as to find no constitutional violation. An analysis under s. 1 was therefore not required (see para. 30).

[420]                     The majority states they are applying the current approach to the analysis. However, they reference Mills and Darrach and adopt the “blended” methodology I have described above, thereby defining s. 11 through s. 7. This is problematic for two reasons. First, the approach as to the order in which ss. 7 and 11 should be addressed was settled in Whaling, at para. 76. Second, the Court confirmed in Carter, at paras. 79-80, and even more recently in Brown, at para. 70, that consideration of “societal interests” should not be factored into the s. 7 balancing, but rather should be dealt with under s. 1. I do not see how the methodology adopted in Mills and Darrach can be reconciled with these subsequent authorities.

[421]                     I emphasize that, regardless of the methodology used, no case from this Court has held that protecting a complainant’s privacy interests always justifies limiting the accused’s right not to respond before the Crown has established the case to meet. Nor has any case from this Court found that access to, or the use of, evidence in which a complainant has a reasonable expectation of privacy never engages the accused’s fair trial rights (see Seaboyer; O’Connor; Mills; Darrach; Osolin; R. v. Shearing, 2002 SCC 58, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 33). To do so, the majority asserts that leading information to defend oneself is merely a tactical burden (see paras. 151-63 and 173-74) and appears to authorize compelled defence disclosure (see paras. 162-69). No judgment of this Court has undercut the accused’s right to a fair trial in so serious a way.

E.            Section 7 Cannot Operate to Limit Section 11 Rights as This Is Inconsistent With the Architecture of the Charter

[422]                     There is no basis in the Constitution for the approach whereby s. 7 can limit rights in ss. 8 to 14. This becomes evident when one examines the structure of the Charter and the places of ss. 7 and 11 within it.

(1)         The Relationship Between Section 7 and Section 11 of the Charter

[423]                     Both ss. 7 and 11 appear under the heading “Legal Rights”. As explained by E. Colvin in his article “Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms” (1989), 68 Can. Bar Rev. 560, at p. 574:

. . . “legal rights” cannot simply mean rights which are recognized in law. All Charter rights would be legal rights in this sense. The use of the term to describe a sub-category of Charter rights suggests that the included rights are of a special kind, different from the rights respecting the substantive content of law which are conferred in some other parts of the Charter.

[424]                     The grouping of ss. 7 and 11 into one subsection of the Charter suggests a relationship between their purposes and the purposes of other rights within that same grouping. Usually, “Legal Rights” are associated with the administration of justice (Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.), 1990 CanLII 105 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1123, at pp. 1172-73, citing Colvin, at pp. 573-74).

[425]                     In Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, the Court concluded that ss. 8 to 14 “are illustrative of deprivations of those rights to life, liberty and security of the person in breach of the principles of fundamental justice” (p. 502). However, they are not exhaustive of s. 7, which is broader (p. 502; Malmo-Levine, at para. 169, referring to Hebert, and Thomson Newspapers Ltd.; see also R. v. Généreux, 1992 CanLII 117 (SCC), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 259, at p. 311). Section 7 provides residual rights protections, where the specific rights in ss. 8 to 14 do not apply. However, the analysis cannot work in reverse to rely on any internal limits under s. 7 to limit the scope of the rights in s. 11. There is simply no basis in the Constitution for doing so.

(2)         Limiting Section 11 on the Basis of Section 7 Is Inconsistent With the Structure of the Charter, the Purposes of Both Provisions and Section 1

[426]                     Limiting s. 11 on the basis of s. 7 is inconsistent with the text and structure of the “Legal Rights” section of the Charter, the purposes of both provisions and s. 1.

[427]                     Textually, there is an internal balancing using the principles of fundamental justice in s. 7, but there are no corresponding textual limits in ss. 11(c) and 11(d). The text of the sections is not the same.

[428]                     Structurally, s. 11 rights can only be limited if the outcome is justified following a proportionality assessment under s. 1.

[429]                     As a practical matter, balancing s. 7 internally and using the outcome to limit s. 11 leads to a reversal of the burden of proof and a dilution of Charter protections. Under s. 11, an accused alleging a violation must prove it; if proven, the onus shifts to the state to justify the violation under s. 1 (Oakes, at pp. 136-37). By contrast, when there is a balancing of Charter rights, Charter values and societal interests under the principles of fundamental justice in s. 7, the burden is on the accused throughout. Accused persons must establish not only the content of the principle of fundamental justice that they allege is violated, but also that it is not outweighed by other considerations. Such an approach undermines the purpose of the broad protection of the right to a fair trial under s. 11 and the purpose of s. 1 to hold the state to the burden of proof to show that any limit is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.

[430]                     A further potentially anomalous result is that s. 11 may first be limited by s. 7 and then, when the usual s. 1 analysis is undertaken, s. 11 rights may be further limited. This implies that s. 11 rights may be limited once, importing limits from s. 7, and then again under s. 1. Yet does this result not follow logically from the majority’s approach?

[431]                     Most fundamentally, limiting s. 11 protections through s. 7 is contrary to the purposes of both ss. 7 and 11. Sections 11(c) and 11(d) are cast broadly in order to provide strong protections for fair trial rights. Section 7 is meant to be a broad, rights-conferring provision that provides residual protection to fair trial rights that may not be captured by s. 11. Yet in these appeals, the Crown and various interveners urge on the Court an approach whereby s. 7 operates to limit the broad rights in s. 11. This is not the proper function of s. 7. It undermines the Charter’s purpose as a counter-majoritarian instrument intended to protect accused persons from the excesses of state power. Rather than protecting the rights of accused persons, s. 7 is being used as the instrument to imperil that protection.

IV.         Suggested Interpretive Approach

[432]                     In order to bring coherence to the application of s. 7 and ss. 8 to 14 when constitutional claims allege violations of s. 7 as well as other sections of the Charter, the Court should adopt and consistently apply an interpretive approach that is in line with the structure and purpose of the Charter. Doing so is a matter of constitutional imperative.

[433]                     Where a specific Charter guarantee is pleaded along with the broader guarantee in s. 7, the specific guarantee should be addressed first. Unless a right is not captured under the specific Charter guarantee, there is no reason to proceed to s. 7. There is nothing new to this proposition. The Court has previously set out this approach in Whaling, at para. 76, citing R. v. Harrer, 1995 CanLII 70 (SCC), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 562, at para. 13, and Généreux, at p. 310 (see also Pearson).

[434]                     In the present case, specific Charter guarantees — ss. 11(c) and 11(d) — are pleaded along with the broader guarantee in s. 7. The first step is therefore to determine whether there is a violation of ss. 11(c) and 11(d), and, if so, whether it is justified under s. 1. If there is a violation that is not justified under s. 1, then the analysis stops there.

[435]                     If, however, there is no violation of the specific provisions, or there is a violation but it is found to be justified, the courts then look to s. 7. As noted at para. 425 above, violations of ss. 8 to 14 are illustrative of deprivations of s. 7 rights, but s. 7 is broader. In these circumstances, the courts must examine whether the rights protected under s. 7 are more extensive or different from those protected under the specific provision. If the answer is no, then no analysis is required under s. 7, since the result under s. 7 remains the same as the result under the specific provision. If the answer is yes, however, courts need to explain in what way it is more extensive or different. This analysis will define the scope of the right protected under s. 7 and the analysis that is required in order to find an infringement.

[436]                     When determining the scope of s. 7, courts should focus on the rights alleged by the rights claimant. For the reasons set out above, there is no place for values and societal interests in the internal balancing in s. 7. Such moral considerations should be weighed using the transparent proportionality analysis in s. 1 (Carter, at para. 79; Brown, at para. 70).

[437]                     This construction of s. 7, s. 11 and s. 1 conforms to the architecture of the Charter, provides for interpretation of the relevant provisions by reference to their own text and purposes, and offers clarity as to which party has the onus of proof at each stage of the analysis.

V.           Conclusion

[438]                     The limitation on the fair trial right is unjustified in this case. I agree with Justice Brown on the merits and would therefore hold that ss. 278.92 to 278.94 of the Criminal Code are unconstitutional and, therefore, of no force or effect, except as they apply to the existing s. 276 regime.

 

The following are the reasons delivered by

 

                  Côté J. —

I.               Overview

[439]                     I have had the benefit of reading the majority’s reasons as well as the dissenting reasons of Brown J. and Rowe J. I endorse the constitutional analyses of Brown J. and Rowe J. I agree with Brown J. that the record screening regime does not come close to passing constitutional muster. I am also in agreement with Rowe J.’s analytical approach in respect of s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. However, I disagree with the analyses and the conclusions of both the majority and Brown J. on the interpretation of “record” and “adduce”.

[440]                     I readily concede that there are issues with any interpretation of both of these words. Unfortunately, this is an inevitable consequence of the “ham-fisted” nature of the record screening regime (Brown J.’s reasons, at paras. 204 and 311). But in my view there are strong reasons to prefer narrow interpretations of both words. Even with narrow interpretations, however, I am of the view that the record screening regime remains unconstitutional. It is simply more constitutionally defective if either the majority’s interpretations or Brown J.’s interpretations are adopted.

[441]                     My reasons proceed in two parts. First, I explain why narrow interpretations of “record” and “adduce” should be adopted. Second, I briefly explain why, even if my narrower interpretations were adopted, Brown J.’s constitutional analysis remains overwhelmingly applicable.

II.            Statutory Interpretation

A.           The Definition of “Record” Excludes Communications Between the Complainant and the Accused

[442]                     In my view, a proper interpretation of “record” as defined in s. 278.1 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, excludes any communications — electronic or otherwise — between the accused and the complainant other than communications made in the context of a professional relationship in which there was an expectation of some degree of confidentiality. Such an interpretation is preferable because: (1) it better accords with the text of s. 278.1; (2) it better reflects the intention of Parliament; (3) it better aligns with the jurisprudence on the interpretation of the phrase “reasonable expectation of privacy”; and (4) it avoids many of the absurd results that inevitably follow from a broad interpretation.

(1)         Text of Section 278.1

[443]                     I begin my analysis with the text. Section 278.1 does not refer to communications — electronic or otherwise — in defining “record”. Communications between the complainant and the accused are not specifically enumerated as records in that section. There is no dispute that communications between the complainant and the accused may be captured by the enumerated categories (e.g. communications between a physician and a patient). The main interpretive question at issue, however, is whether communications between the complainant and the accused are included among the types of records that are not enumerated in the definition. That is, are they covered by the definition of “record” because they nonetheless contain personal information for which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy? In my view, any communications between the accused and the complainant that were not exchanged in the context of a professional relationship in which there was an expectation of some degree of confidentiality would not constitute a record.

[444]                     I agree with the majority that the interpretive principle of ejusdem generis (“of the same kind”) applies (para. 55). However, and with respect, I believe that the majority does not apply this principle properly. The majority relies on it to conclude that “[t]he common thread weaving through the enumerated records is that they contain information of an intimate and highly personal nature that is integral to the complainant’s overall physical, psychological or emotional well‑being”, explaining that this “could include, but is not limited to, discussions regarding mental health diagnoses, suicidal ideation, prior physical or sexual abuse, substance abuse or involvement in the child welfare system” (para. 55). With respect, the majority conflates the concept of “personal information” with that of a “reasonable expectation of privacy”. As Brown J. correctly notes at para. 233 of his reasons, although the diary in question in R. v. Shearing, 2002 SCC 58, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 33, contained only “mundane” entries, that did not eliminate the complainant’s privacy interest.

[445]                     In my view, a proper application of the ejusdem generis principle leads to the conclusion that communications between the complainant and the accused would not be included in the definition of “record”. All the enumerated records fall into one of two distinct categories: (1) records created in a professional context for which there is an expectation of some degree of confidentiality (i.e. medical, psychiatric, therapeutic, counselling, education, employment, child welfare, adoption, and social services records); or (2) records that are intended for the complainant’s exclusive personal use and review (i.e. personal journals and diaries). The phrase “reasonable expectation of privacy” must be interpreted in this context.

[446]                     The common thread weaving through the enumerated records, therefore, is the complainant’s reasonable expectation that such records will not be publicly disclosed. In short, the defining feature of the enumerated records is not the “highly personal nature” of the information; rather it is the complainant’s reasonable expectation that the information will remain private. Accordingly, unenumerated records will be documents containing personal information (broadly defined) that the complainant expects not to be disclosed. These could be either (1) records created in a professional context for which there is an expectation of some degree of confidentiality, even if the relationship is not strictly confidential, or (2) records that are intended for the complainant’s exclusive personal use and review.

[447]                     This interpretation of “record” is consistent with R. v. Quesnelle, 2014 SCC 46, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 390, in which this Court held that the Court of Appeal had erred “in concluding that the complainant could not have a reasonable expectation of privacy because the information was disclosed outside the context of a ‘trust‑like, confidential or therapeutic relationship’” (para. 38). Karakatsanis J., writing for the Court, emphasized the principle that a person may reveal information to an individual or an organization on the understanding that it will be used only for a specific purpose, commenting that “[w]hether a person is entitled to expect that their information will be kept private is a contextual inquiry” (para. 38).

[448]                     The relationship between the police and individuals reporting information to the police cannot be strictly classified as a “trust‑like, confidential or therapeutic relationship”. Nevertheless, Karakatsanis J. rightly stressed that, given the context in which the information had been divulged in that case, there was in effect an expectation of some degree of confidentiality. She stated the following:

People provide information to police in order to protect themselves and others. They are entitled to do so with confidence that the police will only disclose it for good reason. The fact that the information is in the hands of the police should not nullify their interest in keeping that information private from other individuals. [Emphasis added; para. 43.]

Ultimately, a strictly confidential relationship is not required; however, in Quesnelle, it was the relationship between the complainant and the police that grounded the expectation of some degree of confidentiality. That relationship formed the basis of a reasonable expectation that the police would only disclose the information for a good reason, and the complainant retained an interest in keeping the information private from others.

(2)         Legislative Context

[449]                     In addition to being consistent with the text of s. 278.1, a narrower interpretation of “record” is more consistent with other contextual factors — such as the section’s legislative evolution and legislative history. Legislative evolution “consists of the successive enacted versions of [a] provision from its inception to the version in place when the relevant facts occur” (R. Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (6th ed. 2014), at § 23.18). Legislative history, on the other hand, can be more narrowly construed as “the range of extrinsic materials relating to the conception, preparation and passage of a provision, from the earliest proposals for legislative change to royal assent” (Sullivan, at § 23.19).

[450]                     With respect to the section’s legislative evolution, the definition of “record” remains largely unchanged from the original definition that applied to the regime for the production of records by third parties.[2] This weighs heavily in favour of an interpretation that would exclude communications — electronic or otherwise — between a complainant and an accused. Given the absence of an explicit modification, the record screening regime introduced by the Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Department of Justice Act and to make consequential amendments to another Act, S.C. 2018, c. 29 (“Bill C‑51”), cannot have changed the meaning of “record” as defined in s. 278.1. Prior to the enactment of Bill C‑51, communications between the accused and the complainant were not contemplated as falling within the meaning of “record” under the regime for third party records. Such communications were already in the possession of the accused. In my view, by importing a definition of “record” from the regime for the production of third party records, which did not contemplate or include communications between the accused and the complainant, Parliament signaled an intention that such communications do not constitute records for the purposes of the record screening regime.

[451]                     With respect to legislative history, it is important to consider the mischief Bill C‑51 was intended to remedy. The majority mentions that Bill C‑51 was “Parliament’s response” to a 2012 report of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs (para. 9). The report acknowledged the existence of a legislative gap apparent after this Court’s decision in Shearing. The report included the following recommendation: “That the Government of Canada consider amending the Criminal Code to set out a procedure governing the admissibility and use during trial of a complainant’s private records, as defined in section 278.1 of the Criminal Code, which are not wrongfully in the hands of the accused” (Statutory Review on the Provisions and Operation of the Act to amend the Criminal Code (production of records in sexual offence proceedings): Final Report, at p. 20 (emphasis added)).

[452]                     Ultimately, Bill C‑51 was enacted to address a gap in the law that arose where an accused legally came into possession of a record such as a diary or a counselling record. This was the mischief Parliament sought to address. The mischief to be remedied was not the admission at trial of voluntary communications — such as text messages or emails — between the complainant and the accused. This again weighs heavily in favour of an interpretation of “record” that excludes electronic communications between an accused and a complainant.

[453]                     I acknowledge that there is other evidence regarding the legislative history, from the legislative proceedings, for example, that “suggest[s] that Parliament did indeed intend to capture digital conversations between the accused and [the] complainant” (Brown J.’s reasons, at para. 237). This includes references in the Parliamentary debate to the trial in R. v. Ghomeshi, 2016 ONCJ 155, 27 C.R. (7th) 17, and a proposal from defence lawyers to explicitly exclude electronic communications between the complainant and the accused from the record screening regime.

[454]                     Although this other evidence of Parliament’s intent is relevant, I would not give much weight to it. In Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), 1998 CanLII 837 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 35, this Court stated: “Although the frailties of Hansard evidence are many, this Court has recognized that it can play a limited role in the interpretation of legislation.” In my view, the frailties of this evidence of Parliament’s intent are apparent in the case at bar. Notwithstanding the stray and marginal remarks about the Ghomeshi trial and submissions made to Parliament by defence lawyers on the potential implications of language in a draft bill and how it could be improved, I am unconvinced that Parliament intended the record screening regime to apply to communications — electronic or otherwise — between the complainant and the accused. The countervailing evidence of Parliament’s intent that I have discussed — such as the section’s legislative evolution and the 2012 Senate Report — is quite simply more conclusive.

(3)         Jurisprudence on the Phrase “Reasonable Expectation of Privacy”

[455]                     The definition of “record” must also be interpreted in light of this Court’s jurisprudence on the meaning of “reasonable expectation of privacy”, a phrase that has been of particular significance in the jurisprudence relating to s. 8 of the Charter. In R. v. Jarvis, 2019 SCC 10, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 488, the Court concluded that the s. 8 jurisprudence may be instructive when it comes to interpreting privacy interests in non‑Charter contexts (paras. 58‑59). In my view, the interpretations of “record” by both the majority and Brown J. are less consistent with this Court’s jurisprudence and with the common law meaning of the phrase “reasonable expectation of privacy”. The balance of this Court’s jurisprudence favours a narrow interpretation.

[456]                     To be clear, I do not dispute that “[e]xpectations of privacy are contextual and must be assessed in light of the ‘totality of the circumstances’” (majority reasons, at para. 57, citing R. v. Patrick, 2009 SCC 17, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 579, at para. 26, and R. v. Edwards, 1996 CanLII 255 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128, at para. 45). However, the key contextual factor is this: An individual does not have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in communications vis‑à‑vis the recipient of the message. In the context of a trial in which the accused’s liberty is at stake, a complainant therefore does not have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in their communications with the accused. As a result, communications between the accused and the complainant — including communications relating to the subject matter of the charge — do not constitute records for the purposes of the record screening regime. The only exception to this category‑based approach relates to messages exchanged in the context of a professional relationship in which there is an expectation of some degree of confidentiality.

(a)         Meaning of “Reasonable Expectation of Privacy”

[457]                     In R. v. Marakah, 2017 SCC 59, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 608, a majority of this Court held that individuals can retain a reasonable expectation of privacy over the contents of their electronic communications. However, McLachlin C.J. distinguished the risk of dissemination to a private citizen from the risk of dissemination to the state (paras. 40‑41). As she mentioned, “[t]he issue is not who owns the device through which the electronic conversation is accessed, but rather whether the claimant exercised control over the information reflected therein” (para. 43 (emphasis in original)). McLachlin C.J. acknowledged that by sharing information, Mr. Marakah had accepted the risk that the information might then be shared with third parties, but she concluded that, “by accepting this risk, Mr. Marakah did not give up control over the information or his right to protection under s. 8” (para. 41).

[458]                     In my view, this Court’s decision in Marakah must be read in light of s. 8 of the Charter. As McLachlin C.J. explicitly stated: “The risk that the recipient could have disclosed it, if he chose to, does not negate the reasonableness of Mr. Marakah’s expectation of privacy against state intrusion” (para. 45 (emphasis added)). Moreover, by acknowledging that the recipient could have disclosed the information, McLachlin C.J. implicitly recognized that some control over the information had effectively been ceded to the recipient. This is a natural consequence of sharing information with others.

[459]                     This Court’s decision in R. v. Mills, 2019 SCC 22, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 320, likewise supports my narrower interpretation of “record”. The issue in Mills was whether the police had breached the accused’s right under s. 8 of the Charter by posing online as a 14‑year‑old girl and capturing the accused’s messages to the fictional child. Brown J. concluded that the accused’s expectation of privacy was objectively unreasonable, noting that the police were “simply responding to messages sent directly to them” (para. 29). In concurring reasons, Karakatsanis J. wrote: “. . . an individual cannot reasonably expect their words to be kept private from the person with whom they are communicating” (para. 42; see also para. 51). Moldaver J. concurred with the reasons of both Brown J. and Karakatsanis J., stating that they were both “sound in law” (para. 66). Martin J., in separate concurring reasons, did not dispute the general proposition that an individual cannot reasonably expect their words to be kept private from the person with whom they are communicating, but she instead held: “That general proposition does not and cannot apply when the state has secretly set itself up as the intended recipient” (para. 101).

[460]                     Both Marakah and Mills support my narrower interpretation of “record”. Although my interpretation is more category‑based, it nonetheless remains consistent with the fundamental premise in the jurisprudence that expectations of privacy are contextual. To reiterate, the key contextual factor is that an individual does not have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in communications vis‑à‑vis the recipient of the message.

[461]                     The only exception to this category‑based approach relates to messages exchanged in the context of a professional relationship in which there is an expectation of some degree of confidentiality. It is reasonable to conclude that a complainant has a reasonable expectation of privacy — vis‑à‑vis an accused psychologist or doctor, for example — in communications exchanged in the context of such a relationship. In such circumstances, the professional relationship and the corresponding expectation of some degree of confidentiality ground a reasonable expectation of privacy. This approach is therefore consistent with the principle that privacy interests include a “reasonable expectation that private information will remain confidential to the persons to whom and restricted to the purposes for which it was divulged” (R. v. Mills, 1999 CanLII 637 (SCC), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 668, at para. 108).

[462]                     In any event, I note that communications exchanged in the context of a professional relationship (e.g. emails with a psychologist) are clearly included in s. 278.1 as enumerated records. They would therefore automatically be subject to the record screening regime.

[463]                     I recognize that a distinction can be made between a complainant sharing private information with an accused and the accused disseminating that information in the context of a public trial. However, in the context of a trial for a sexual offence, it is difficult to see how — based on an objective assessment — a complainant can reasonably expect the accused not to rely on information the complainant had freely shared with the accused if the information is relevant to an issue at trial. Context matters. Where the accused’s liberty is at stake, a complainant’s expectation of privacy in communications with the accused is objectively unreasonable unless the information was disclosed in the context of a professional relationship in which there was an expectation of some degree of confidentiality.

[464]                     It is helpful, in my view, to highlight the implications of the majority’s approach to the complainant’s privacy interests, specifically as it relates to communications with the accused that pertain to the subject matter of the charge. According to the majority, a complainant “will often”, but not always, have a reasonable expectation of privacy in records of an explicit sexual nature, including communications with the accused relating to the subject matter of the charge (para. 65). The majority’s “content and context framework” (para. 67) is equivocal and indeterminate, as “evidence of an explicit sexual nature that relates to the subject matter of the charge may be caught by the record screening regime even if it is not s. 276 evidence” (para. 66 (emphasis added)).

[465]                     With respect, the majority’s approach fails fundamentally to assess whether the complainant’s expectation of privacy is objectively reasonable in the circumstances. It gives undue weight to the content of the communications, while simultaneously disregarding or minimizing other significant contextual factors, such as the fact that the accused is a party to the communications, the fact that the communications in question may relate to the subject matter of the charge and the fact that the accused’s liberty is at stake. In this way, the majority conflates the assessment of the complainant’s (possible) subjective expectation of privacy with the assessment of whether that expectation of privacy is objectively reasonable in the circumstances. The result of the majority’s confounding approach is twofold.

[466]                     First, no meaningful guidance is provided to counsel or to trial judges. Counsel for the accused must simply discern — with reference to the majority’s ill‑defined “type of content” (para. 55) and other “non-exhaustive” contextual factors (para. 57) — whether a message relating to the subject matter of the charge may or may not be subject to the record screening regime. Contrary to the majority’s statement, the test they have articulated for interpreting s. 278.1 will not “reduc[e] the need for motions for directions” (para. 104).

[467]                     Second, the majority’s conception of and approach to privacy is inconsistent with the idea that a reasonable expectation of privacy standard is normative rather than simply descriptive (R. v. Tessling, 2004 SCC 67, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 432, at para. 42; R. v. Spencer, 2014 SCC 43, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 212, at para. 18; Jarvis, at para. 68). Subject to the single exception I have discussed above, I fail to see how a complainant can have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in any messages exchanged with the accused that include information — whether explicit or inexplicit — pertaining to the subject matter of the charge. The trial context is determinative: the complainant has stepped forward with an accusation against the accused; the accused is being prosecuted in open court; the accused faces a loss of liberty; the accused has the right to make full answer and defence; the communications at issue were between the complainant and the accused; and the communications at issue contain information that directly pertains to the criminal accusation (i.e. the subject matter of the charge) against the accused. In these circumstances, the complainant does not have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the communications. The mere statement by the majority that its approach “take[s] into account the trial context” does not make it so (para. 62).

(b)         Content‑Neutral Analysis

[468]                     With respect, I am of the view that the majority is wrong to abandon the content‑neutral approach from the s. 8 jurisprudence. I say this for five reasons.

[469]                     First, there is nothing in the text of s. 278.1 that suggests that doing so is necessary. There is quite simply no reason to depart from the common law meaning of the phrase “reasonable expectation of privacy” and the content‑neutral approach that has been developed in relation to it.

[470]                     Second, a content‑neutral approach facilitates the operation of the record screening regime: it allows lawyers and judges to more easily assess whether a document is a “record” on its face. This would render the majority’s convoluted approach to records unnecessary and would have the significant benefit of largely averting the need for motions for directions.

[471]                     Third, the majority’s justification for jettisoning the content‑neutral approach is unpersuasive. The majority states that “it would be difficult to meaningfully assess or protect” (para. 49) a complainant’s privacy interests using a content‑neutral approach. However, as I explained above, the common thread weaving through the records enumerated in s. 278.1 is not the sensitivity of their content, but the expectation that they will not be publicly disclosed. All of the enumerated records are either (1) records created in a professional context for which there is an expectation of some degree of confidentiality or (2) records that are intended for the complainant’s exclusive personal use and review. The content of such records can vary dramatically — from information that is mundane to information that is deeply personal. Yet all of them are included in the record screening regime because the complainant’s expectation that they will not be disclosed is reasonable. The focus should therefore be on the expectation of privacy rather than on the content of the information.

[472]                     Fourth, the majority’s justification for jettisoning the content‑neutral approach is internally inconsistent with their own reasons as well as being inconsistent with Shearing. The majority states: “Records do not attract a reasonable expectation of privacy simply because of the medium used to convey them” (para. 49). The majority also notes, however, that “mundane information such as general emotional states, everyday occurrences or general biographical information would typically not give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy” (para. 56). This is clearly inconsistent with Shearing. The diary in Shearing contained only “very mundane” entries, yet this did not extinguish the complainant’s privacy interest (Shearing, at paras. 87 and 112). As well, the majority in the case at bar later emphasizes that “courts may consider where the record was shared and how it was created or obtained”, juxtaposing mediums like text messages that “may attract an enhanced reasonable expectation of privacy” with other mediums like social media that would attract a lower expectation of privacy (para. 60 (emphasis added)). Clearly, records can attract a reasonable expectation of privacy — regardless of their content — based on the medium used to convey the information.

[473]                     Fifth, the majority’s justification for abandoning the content‑neutral approach is inconsistent with the fundamental premise of the record screening regime. This regime specifically concerns records. It does not, contrary to the majority’s conclusion, concern “information of an intimate and highly personal nature that is integral to the complainant’s overall physical, psychological or emotional well‑being” (para. 54). If, for example, the accused learns that the complainant is dealing with “suicidal ideation” or “substance abuse” (para. 55) in the course of an oral conversation in which no record was created, the record screening regime would not apply. This entirely undermines the majority’s rationale for abandoning the content‑neutral approach to assessing whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. In the record screening regime, the medium — and the expectation of privacy that exists in the context of that medium — is determinative.

(4)         Absurd Results

[474]                     As this Court observed in Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes, “[i]t is a well established principle of statutory interpretation that the legislature does not intend to produce absurd consequences” (para. 27). There are three absurd results that would be averted by adopting a narrow category‑based approach to the interpretation of “record”.

[475]                     First, a category‑based approach would have significant practical benefits in terms of trial efficiency. If electronic communications between an accused and a complainant fall within the ambit of the record screening regime, an accused seeking to adduce hundreds of electronic communications into evidence will be required to contextually assess each message in order to determine whether it constitutes a “record”. Some of these messages may meet the majority’s threshold for “record” and some may not. The status of many messages, however, will remain ambiguous. Continual recourse to motions for directions — not contemplated in the regime — will be necessary. This added procedure will inevitably have an adverse impact on trial efficiency, thereby making trials for sexual offences even more unwieldly and complicated.

[476]                     Second, the majority’s interpretation of “record” will result in an absurd two-tiered system of admissibility that favours the Crown: the Crown can adduce any communications provided to it by the complainant, while the accused cannot adduce communications in its possession that were freely exchanged with the complainant. The majority purports to draw on the common law meaning of the phrase “reasonable expectation of privacy”. However, the majority interprets the phrase in a manner that affords the complainant greater protection than the accused in their electronic communications with each other, despite the fact that the accused’s communications will have been disclosed to the state. This is an absurd, and needless, consequence of the majority’s interpretation.

[477]                     Third, a broad interpretation of “record” will lead to the absurd consequence of having the record screening regime — needlessly and without a principled justification — create a distinction between information exchanged orally and information exchanged through electronic means. In Marakah, McLachlin C.J. characterized text messages as “part of an electronic conversation”, which, she observed, “reflects the technological reality of text messaging” (para. 17). The majority’s broad interpretation of “record” will now result in the record screening regime treating electronic communications differently than oral conversations merely because the electronic conversations were recorded. This is absurd. It is unclear how an individual retains more control (or why they should do so) over information shared with an accused individual via electronic means than they would over information shared orally.

(5)         Conclusion on the Interpretation of “Record”

[478]                     For the foregoing reasons, a narrow interpretation of “record” should be adopted. With respect, the majority’s approach to the interpretation of “record” is needlessly ambiguous, complicated and confusing. It is neither principled nor pragmatic.

B.            Plain Meaning of “Adduce” Should Be Adopted

[479]                     Sections 278.92 and 278.93 of the Criminal Code together are clear: they require an application only where an accused intends to introduce a copy of the actual record into evidence — “adduce” simply means adduce. An application is not required where an accused intends only to ask questions about the information contained in the record, and not to adduce the record in evidence. There are three reasons to prefer a narrow interpretation of “adduce”.

[480]                     First, the record screening regime is ultimately about the admissibility of “records”, in contrast to other statutory or common law schemes that govern the admissibility of a category of evidence (such as evidence under s. 276 of the Criminal Code or Scopelliti character evidence). Given that the record screening regime is focused on physical records rather than on a category of evidence, the plain meaning of “adduce” should be adopted, as it relates directly to the physical record. It is incongruous for the record screening regime to make all personal information presumptively inadmissible merely because the information happens to be documented in a record, and regardless of whether there was ever an intention to introduce — that is, adduce — that record in evidence.

[481]                     Second, interpreting “adduce” more broadly to include using the information contained in the record means that an accused who kept a record will be subject to the regime, whereas an accused who forgot about the existence of a record, lost the record, destroyed the record or learned about the information contained in it through an oral conversation will not be subject to the regime. There is an inherent incongruity in an interpretation of “adduce” that prevents one accused from using relevant information contained in a record merely because this accused possesses the best evidence of the information in question, whereas another accused will be permitted to use the same information (e.g. by asking questions during cross‑examination of the complainant) because the second accused does not possess a record containing the information.

[482]                     Third, the majority’s interpretation of “adduce” is, in my respectful view, highly problematic given their broad interpretation of “record”. Witnesses are generally permitted to give evidence about things said to them in conversations, provided the evidence is relevant and otherwise admissible. Given McLachlin C.J.’s description of text messaging as an “electronic conversation” (Marakah, at para. 17), it follows that an accused should be permitted to ask the complainant questions about any electronic conversations between them that are relevant to an issue at trial. Barring an evidentiary rule (like the one in s. 276) that prohibits the accused from producing certain types of evidence, an accused should also be permitted to testify about electronic conversations with the complainant. In R. v. Fliss, 2002 SCC 16, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 535, this Court held that the jury was entitled to hear from a police officer about a conversation with the accused, and that the officer was entitled to refresh his memory by any means, including a stimulus that would constitute inadmissible evidence (para. 8, per Arbour J.; paras. 43‑45, per Binnie J.). Similarly, in Mills (2019), Karakatsanis J. explained that, even if screenshots of messages between an accused and an undercover police officer could not be tendered as evidence, “the Crown could still call the officer to testify about what the accused said and the written record could be used to refresh the officer’s memory” (para. 54). In my view, the same approach must be taken with the record screening regime.

III.         Record Screening Regime Remains Unconstitutional

[483]                     Brown J. concludes that the record screening regime limits the accused’s rights under ss. 11(c), 11(d) and 7 of the Charter in four ways: (1) it forces accused persons to reveal their defence before the Crown has made out a case to meet, contrary to the principle against self‑incrimination, the right to silence, and the presumption of innocence; (2) it restricts the accused’s ability to cross‑examine Crown witnesses by giving the complainant a role in pre‑trial admissibility determinations; (3) it makes private records presumptively inadmissible when tendered by the defence, but presumptively admissible when tendered by the Crown; and (4) it sets a stricter test for admitting defence evidence than is warranted or constitutionally permissible (para. 203).

[484]                     Even with my narrower interpretations, Brown J.’s constitutional analysis remains overwhelmingly applicable. The record screening regime is simply more constitutionally defective based on the broader interpretations adopted by the majority. I briefly explain why Brown J.’s analysis remains applicable.

[485]                     First, the record screening regime continues to force accused persons to reveal their defence before the Crown has made out a case to meet even if my narrow interpretations of “record” and “adduce” were adopted. Thus, the regime continues to require pre‑trial disclosure — before the Crown has made out a case to meet — for various records and it continues to apply to “a broad swathe of evidence that is not inherently prejudicial or irrelevant” (Brown J.’s reasons, at para. 254).

[486]                     Second, it remains the case that the record screening regime restricts the accused’s ability to cross‑examine Crown witnesses by giving the complainant a role in pre‑trial admissibility determinations. Once again, Brown J.’s analysis applies even if my narrower interpretations were adopted. The record screening regime operates to give advance notice to the complainant and the Crown, providing them with detailed particulars of the evidence the accused wishes to adduce. Accordingly, the record screening regime limits “the accused’s ability to effectively cross‑examine the complainant, contrary to the presumption of innocence, the right to make full answer and defence and the right to a fair trial” (Brown J.’s reasons, at para. 263).

[487]                     Third, the record screening regime still makes private records presumptively inadmissible when tendered by the defence, but presumptively admissible when tendered by the Crown. My narrower interpretations of “record” and “adduce” do not affect this glaring issue with the regime. The record screening regime therefore continues to limit “the accused’s right to a fair trial under ss. 7 and 11(d)” (Brown J.’s reasons, at para. 290).

[488]                     Fourth, nothing in my interpretations of “record” and “adduce” affects how the record screening regime sets a stricter test for admitting defence evidence than is warranted or constitutionally permissible. Brown J.’s constitutional analysis on the heightened standard of “significant probative value” continues to apply (Brown J.’s reasons, at paras. 291‑97).

[489]                     None of these limits on the accused’s Charter rights can be justified under s. 1 of the Charter. I agree that the objective of the record screening regime is pressing and substantial. However, even with my narrower interpretations of “record” and “adduce”, the regime is not rationally connected to its objective, it is not minimally impairing, and its salutary effects do not outweigh its deleterious effects. I acknowledge that Brown J.’s analysis under s. 1 is not entirely applicable, as my narrower interpretations render the regime less broad and mitigate some of its deleterious consequences. Nevertheless, the bulk of Brown J.’s s. 1 analysis continues to apply.

[490]                     In conclusion, I concur with Brown J.’s constitutional analysis. I also concur with Brown J.’s analysis on the features a record screening regime might include in order to minimally impair the rights of accused persons and, therefore, be constitutional (Brown J.’s reasons, at para. 311).

IV.         Disposition

[491]                     In light of the foregoing reasons, I agree with the disposition of the appeals proposed by Brown J. and by Rowe J. (Brown J.’s reasons, at para. 320; Rowe J.’s reasons, at para. 438).

                    Rowe J. —

I.               Introduction

[1]                              This appeal arises from disciplinary proceedings pursued by the appellant, the Law Society of Saskatchewan (“Law Society”), against the respondent, Peter V. Abrametz. Mr. Abrametz was found guilty of four charges of conduct unbecoming a lawyer, and disbarred without a right to apply for readmission for almost two years.

[2]                              During the disciplinary proceedings, Mr. Abrametz applied for a stay of the proceedings on the basis of inordinate delay amounting to an abuse of process. His application was dismissed by the Hearing Committee for the Law Society (“Hearing Committee”), but allowed on appeal by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. The Law Society appeals from that decision.

[3]                              This appeal affords the Court the opportunity to address once again the doctrine of abuse of process as it relates to inordinate delay in the administrative context. This was recognized more than 20 years ago in Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), 2000 SCC 44, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 307. This appeal also allows us to clarify the standard of review applicable to questions of procedural fairness and to abuse of process in statutory appeals.

[4]                              I would allow the appeal. While the Court of Appeal correctly determined the standard of review, it failed to apply it properly. The Hearing Committee did not err when it concluded that there was no abuse of process.

II.            Facts

[5]                              Mr. Abrametz is a member of the Law Society of Saskatchewan. He has practiced in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, for 49 years.

A.           Pre-Charge Investigation

[6]                              In 2012, the Law Society commenced an audit investigation of Mr. Abrametz’s financial records due to apparent irregularities in the use of a trust account. On the eve of a visit by investigators to his office in December 2012, Mr. Abrametz self-reported to the Law Society that he had failed to promptly deposit more than $36,000 in fees into his office account.

[7]                              The Law Society’s investigation related to eight transactions by Mr. Abrametz. In seven of these, Mr. Abrametz had issued cheques to clients that were then endorsed by the clients and cashed by Mr. Abrametz. In the other case, he had issued three cheques to a fictitious person, endorsed that false name on the cheques and cashed them. In addition, Mr. Abrametz had on 11 occasions advanced money to clients, relating to settlement funds, charging them a flat 30 percent fee of the amount advanced, as well as a 30 percent contingency fee, and interest.

[8]                              The investigation also looked into whether some of these transactions were carried out to evade tax.

[9]                              In February 2013, Mr. Abrametz was served with a notice of intention to interim suspend. However, by agreement with the Law Society in March 2013, Mr. Abrametz was allowed to continue to practice, subject to certain conditions: Mr. Abrametz had to retain another lawyer to supervise and monitor his practice and trust account activities; he had to seek prior approval from this supervisor for withdrawals/cheques from any trust account; and he could not accept the return of trust cheques from clients, nor accept endorsed cheques to be cashed or negotiated. A second notice of intention to interim suspend was served in November 2014, but the Law Society and Mr. Abrametz again agreed that he could continue to practice under substantially similar conditions. Mr. Abrametz continued to practice under these conditions without incident while the Law Society investigation continued.

[10]                          In October 2014, the auditor submitted a final trust report to the Law Society.

[11]                          In October 2015, the Law Society issued a formal complaint containing seven charges against Mr. Abrametz and appointed a Hearing Committee.

B.            Post-Charge Prosecution

[12]                          A simultaneous investigation into Mr. Abrametz’s tax situation gave rise to litigation before the Court of Queen’s Bench between the Law Society and Mr. Abrametz regarding the scope of the Law Society’s investigatory powers: 2016 SKQB 134; 2016 SKQB 320, 408 D.L.R. (4th) 134.

[13]                          In March 2016, Mr. Abrametz applied to the Hearing Committee for an interim stay of the disciplinary proceedings until the resolution of the tax investigation. The Hearing Committee dismissed the request in August 2016.

[14]                          The Hearing Committee heard the disciplinary matter on May 17-19, August 9-10 and September 29, 2017. The conduct decision was rendered on January 10, 2018. Mr. Abrametz was found guilty of four of the seven charges. The four convictions were for matters disclosed in his self-report; they related to the advances to clients on settlement funds (referred to above).

[15]                          On July 13, 2018, Mr. Abrametz applied for a stay of proceedings on the basis that the time taken by the Law Society to investigate and decide his case constituted an abuse of process. The application was heard on September 18, 2018, at the same hearing as that for submissions regarding penalty. The stay application was dismissed on November 9, 2018, in the stay decision.

[16]                          On January 20, 2019, the penalty decision was rendered; the Committee ordered Mr. Abrametz disbarred without a right to apply for readmission until January 1, 2021.

[17]                          The conduct, stay and penalty decisions were published as one. In these reasons I address primarily the stay.

III.         Judgments Below

A.           Hearing Committee for the Law Society of Saskatchewan, 2018 SKLSS 8 (D. Chow, J. McCuskee and E. Sorestad)

[18]                          On the question of delay, the Hearing Committee found that Mr. Abrametz had made extensive efforts to conceal his actions. The Committee also referred to the complexity arising from the nature and number of allegations of conduct unbecoming and the number of client files and other documents that needed to be examined. The Hearing Committee also found that a significant share of delay in the proceedings should be attributed to Mr. Abrametz, due to his unavailability or the unavailability of his counsel. The Hearing Committee further noted that Mr. Abrametz had brought an application for a temporary stay of proceedings in April 2016.

[19]                          The Hearing Committee found that the delay was neither inordinate nor unacceptable given the complexity of the case, the extent of the investigation and the delay attributed directly to Mr. Abrametz’s conduct. The Hearing Committee also concluded that any prejudice that Mr. Abrametz may have experienced as a result of the delay was not so significant that continuation of the process would be so unfair to him that the public’s sense of fairness would be harmed, having regard to the Law Society’s mandate to protect the public.

B.            Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, 2020 SKCA 81 (Ottenbreit, Leurer and Barrington-Foote JJ.A.)

[20]                          Mr. Abrametz appealed the conduct, penalty and stay decisions to the Court of Appeal pursuant to s. 56(1) of The Legal Profession Act, 1990, S.S. 1990-91, c. L‑10.1.

[21]                          The Court of Appeal dismissed Mr. Abrametz’s conduct appeal but allowed the stay appeal.

[22]                          The Court of Appeal held that whether there had been delay constituting an abuse of process is a question of law, reviewable on the basis of correctness; the findings of fact underlying the stay decision are reviewable on the standard of palpable and overriding error.

[23]                          The Court of Appeal stated that Blencoe set a high threshold for finding an abuse of process where hearing fairness had not been compromised. The Court of Appeal concluded, nonetheless, that Mr. Abrametz was entitled to a stay.

[24]                          The Court of Appeal concluded that there were significant periods that were not adequately explained and that could not be justified by the scale and complexity of the proceedings. The Court of Appeal concluded that of the 53-month period in issue, only 18 months were inherent to the process, and only 2 ½ months were attributable to Mr. Abrametz. The remainder, totaling 32 ½ months, the Court of Appeal concluded, was undue delay. The Hearing Committee’s failure to reach that conclusion was the result of palpable and overriding errors (as referred to), and the Hearing Committee’s failure to apply the law correctly to the facts.

[25]                          The Court of Appeal concluded that there had been inordinate delay which resulted in significant prejudice to Mr. Abrametz, such that the public’s sense of decency and fairness would be affected. It concluded that this inordinate delay would bring the Law Society’s disciplinary process into disrepute. Mr. Abrametz’s application for a stay should have been granted by the Hearing Committee.

IV.         Analysis

A.           Standard of Review

[26]                          This case allows the Court to clarify the standard of review applicable to questions of procedural fairness and abuse of process in a statutory appeal. The Court received submissions from the parties and interveners on this point.

[27]                          In Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, the Court held that when the legislature provides for a statutory appeal mechanism from an administrative decision maker to a court, this indicates that appellate standards are to apply: paras. 33 and 36-52. While this proposition was stated in the context of substantive review, the direction that appeals are to be decided according to the appellate standards of review was categorical. Thus, where questions of procedural fairness are dealt with through a statutory appeal mechanism, they are subject to appellate standards of review.

[28]                          This does not depart from Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Khosa, 2009 SCC 12, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 339, and Mission Institution v. Khela, 2014 SCC 24, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 502, as those decisions related to judicial review and to the granting of prerogative writs. Here, we are dealing with a statutory appeal. As our Court has stated in Vavilov, at para. 36, “[w]here a legislature has provided that parties may appeal from an administrative decision to a court, either as of right or with leave, it has subjected the administrative regime to appellate oversight and indicated that it expects the court to scrutinize such administrative decisions on an appellate basis.”

[29]                          This case is a statutory appeal pursuant to The Legal Profession Act, 1990. Therefore, the standard of review is correctness for questions of law and palpable and overriding error for questions of fact and of mixed fact and law: Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235; Ward v. Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse), 2021 SCC 43, at paras. 24-25.

[30]                          Whether there has been an abuse of process is a question of law. Thus, the applicable standard of review is correctness.

B.            Inordinate Delay in Administrative Law

(1)         Introduction

[31]                          Administrative decision makers regularly decide issues that affect individuals’ rights, privileges and interests. This Court recognized the important role of administrative decision makers in Vavilov, at para. 4:

This area of the law concerns matters which are fundamental to our legal and constitutional order, and seeks to navigate the proper relationship between administrative decision makers, the courts and individuals in our society. In parallel with the law, the role of administrative decision making in Canada has also evolved. Today, the administration of countless public bodies and regulatory regimes has been entrusted to statutory delegates with decision-making power. The number, diversity and importance of the matters that come before such delegates has made administrative decision making one of the principal manifestations of state power in the lives of Canadians.

[32]                          Legislatures delegate authority to administrative decision makers because of their proximity and responsiveness to stakeholders, their ability to render decisions promptly, flexibly and efficiently, and their ability to provide simplified and streamlined proceedings that can promote access to justice: Vavilov, at para. 29.

(2)         The Doctrine of Abuse of Process

[33]                          The doctrine of abuse of process is rooted in a court’s inherent and residual discretion to prevent abuse of its process: Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79, 2003 SCC 63, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 77, at para. 35; Behn v. Moulton Contracting Ltd., 2013 SCC 26, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 227, at para. 39; R. v. Power, 1994 CanLII 126 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601, at p. 612; P. M. Perell, “A Survey of Abuse of Process”, in T. L. Archibald and R. S. Echlin, eds., Annual Review of Civil Litigation 2007 (2007), 243, at p. 243. The doctrine was recognized in R. v. Jewitt, 1985 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 128, at pp. 135-37, where the Court drew from Dubin J.A. in R. v. Young (1984), 1984 CanLII 2145 (ON CA), 40 C.R. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 329, where he stated that

there is a residual discretion in a trial court judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community’s sense of fair play and decency and to prevent the abuse of a court’s process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings. [Emphasis added; p. 135.]

[34]                          Abuse of process is a broad concept that applies in various contexts: C.U.P.E., at para. 36; Behn, at para. 39. In criminal proceedings, unfair or oppressive treatment of an accused can constitute an abuse of the court’s process and warrant judicial intervention: R. v. Cawthorne, 2016 SCC 32, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 983, at para. 25, citing Power, at pp. 612-15; Jewitt, at pp. 136-37; R. v. O’Connor, 1995 CanLII 51 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, at para. 59. In civil matters, it can warrant granting a motion to strike pleadings or to preclude relitigation of an issue: see Behn; Canam Enterprises Inc. v. Coles (2000), 2000 CanLII 8514 (ON CA), 51 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.), rev’d 2002 SCC 63 (CanLII), 2022 SCC 63, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 307.

[35]                          It is also characterized by its flexibility. It is not encumbered by specific requirements, unlike the concepts of res judicata and issue estoppel: Behn, at para. 40; C.U.P.E., at paras. 37-38. In Behn, at para. 40, LeBel J. referred with approval to Goudge J.A., dissenting, in Canam Enterprises Inc. (C.A.), where Goudge J.A. explained that the doctrine of abuse of process

engages the inherent power of the court to prevent the misuse of its procedure, in a way that would be manifestly unfair to a party to the litigation before it or would in some other way bring the administration of justice into disrepute. It is a flexible doctrine unencumbered by the specific requirements of concepts such as issue estoppel. [Emphasis added; para. 55.]

Such flexibility is important in the administrative law context, given the wide variety of circumstances in which delegated authority is exercised.

[36]                          The primary focus is the integrity of courts’ adjudicative functions, and less on the interests of parties: C.U.P.E., at para. 43; R. v. Conway, 1989 CanLII 66 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1659, at p. 1667; R. v. Scott, 1990 CanLII 27 (SCC), [1990] 3 S.C.R. 979, at p. 1007. The proper administration of justice and ensuring fairness are central to the doctrine: Behn, at para. 41; British Columbia (Workers’ Compensation Board) v. Figliola, 2011 SCC 52, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 422, at paras. 24-25 and 31. It aims to prevent unfairness by precluding “abuse of the decision-making process”: Figliola, at para. 34, citing Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., 2001 SCC 44, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 460, at para. 20.

[37]                          Such considerations underlie the courts’ concern with inordinate delay in the administrative context.

(3)         Abuse of Process in Administrative Proceedings

[38]                          In administrative proceedings, abuse of process is a question of procedural fairness: Blencoe, at paras. 105-7 and 121; G. Régimbald, Canadian Administrative Law (3rd ed. 2021), at pp. 344-350; P. Garant, with P. Garant and J. Garant, Droit administratif (7th ed. 2017), at pp. 766-67). This Court dealt with abuse of process as it relates to administrative delay in Blencoe. Our Court recognized that decision makers have, as a corollary to their duty to act fairly, the power to assess allegedly abusive delay.

[39]                          Mr. Blencoe, a former British Columbia Cabinet Minister, was accused by several women of sexual harassment. They filed complaints with the then British Columbia Council of Human Rights. Hearings were scheduled more than 30 months after the initial complaints were filed. Mr. Blencoe applied to have the proceedings stayed on the basis of abuse of process. While this Court declined to do so, it described circumstances when a stay could be ordered.

[40]                          The Court explained two ways in which delay may constitute an abuse of process.

[41]                          The first concerns hearing fairness. The fairness of a hearing can be compromised where delay impairs a party’s ability to answer the complaint against them, such as when memories have faded, essential witnesses are unavailable or evidence has been lost: Blencoe, at para. 102; D. J. M. Brown and J. M. Evans, with the assistance of D. Fairlie, Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada (loose-leaf), at § 9:57.

[42]                          This is not what is in issue in this appeal. Rather, the Court is concerned with a second category of abuse of process. Even when there is no prejudice to hearing fairness, an abuse of process may occur if significant prejudice has come about due to inordinate delay: Blencoe, at paras. 122 and 132.

[43]                          Blencoe sets out a three-step test to determine whether delay that does not affect hearing fairness nonetheless amounts to an abuse of process. First, the delay must be inordinate. Second, the delay must have directly caused significant prejudice. When these two requirements are met, courts or tribunals will proceed to a final assessment of whether the delay amounts to an abuse of process. Delay will amount to an abuse of process if it is manifestly unfair to a party or in some other way brings the administration of justice into disrepute: Behn, at paras. 40-41.

[44]                          The minority reasons in Blencoe concluded that there was an abuse of process, although the appropriate remedy was not a stay but rather an order for an expedited hearing and costs. In my view, the two sets of reasons in Blencoe can be read as complementing each other and expressing a coherent set of principles. The majority reasons set a higher threshold only for an abuse of process requiring a stay, and accepted that lesser remedies continue to be available where a stay is not warranted. With respect to when a stay of proceedings is warranted, the minority reasons recognized that a threshold of “shocking abuse” is necessary to justify a stay of proceedings (para. 155). Moreover, the minority reasons set a lower threshold for an abuse of process which might call for a lesser remedy, such as an order for an expedited hearing or costs.

(4)         Calls to “Jordanize” Blencoe

[45]                          The Court received submissions to the effect that since Blencoe, it has become more active in addressing institutional delays in criminal proceedings: see R. v. Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631. Mr. Abrametz and some of the interveners argue the Blencoe test needs to be revisited to bring it into conformity with contemporary approaches to delay. Mr. Abrametz refers to the “culture of complacency” in the criminal justice system addressed in Jordan: R.F., at paras. 88-104. Without asking for the direct adoption of the Jordan framework in administrative law, Mr. Abrametz sought to have this Court recognize inordinate delay as prejudicial in and of itself.

[46]                          Inordinate delay in administrative proceedings, as in other legal proceedings, is contrary to the interests of society. Decisions by administrative decision makers need to be rendered promptly and efficiently. Administrative delay undermines a key purpose for which such decision-making authority was delegated — expeditious and efficient decision-making.

[47]                          However, there are important reasons why Jordan does not apply to administrative proceedings. Jordan deals with the right to be tried within a reasonable time under s. 11(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom. No such Charter right applies to administrative proceedings. As such, there is no constitutional right outside the criminal context to be “tried” within a reasonable time.

[48]                          There are fundamental differences between criminal and administrative proceedings: Blencoe, at paras. 88-96. A human rights body’s investigation is aimed at determining what took place and seeks to settle the matter in a non-adversarial manner. The purpose of human rights proceedings is to eradicate discrimination, rather than to punish an offender: Blencoe, at paras. 94 and 126. Similar distinctions can be drawn between disciplinary and criminal matters. While the former are intended to regulate professional conduct within a limited private sphere of activity, the latter is intended to maintain public order and welfare for the broad public: R. v. Wigglesworth, 1987 CanLII 41 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 541, at p. 560.

[49]                          I will now deal more fully with the application of the doctrine of abuse of process to administrative delays.

(5)         First Requirement: Whether the Delay is Inordinate

[50]                          That a process took considerable time does not in itself amount to inordinate delay. Rather, one must consider the time in light of the circumstances of the case (Brown and Evans, at § 9:57-9:58; R. W. Macaulay, J. L. H. Sprague and L. Sossin, Practice and Procedure Before Administrative Tribunals (loose-leaf), at § 16:81; Blencoe, at para. 122). A process that seems lengthy may be justified on the basis of fairness.

[51]                          In determining whether delay is inordinate, the court or tribunal should consider the following contextual factors: (a) the nature and purpose of the proceedings, (b) the length and causes of the delay, and (c) the complexity of the facts and issues in the case. These factors are not exhaustive, such that additional contextual factors can be considered in a particular case.

(a)           The Nature and Purpose of the Proceedings

(i)            Introduction

[52]                          Many public bodies and regulatory agencies have been entrusted with decision-making authority as statutory delegates: Vavilov, at paras. 4 and 88. Their decisions vary in complexity and significance. Sometimes they involve technical considerations. Other times, common sense and an understanding of the practicalities of ordinary life suffice: Vavilov, at para. 88. Of necessity, time requirements inherent to each of these kinds of proceedings will vary.

(ii)           Disciplinary Proceedings

[53]                          The purposes of disciplinary bodies are to protect the public, to regulate the profession and to preserve public confidence in the profession: The Legal Profession Act, 1990, ss. 3.1 and 3.2; Pharmascience Inc. v. Binet, 2006 SCC 48, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 513, at para. 36; Finney v. Barreau du Québec, 2004 SCC 36, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 17, at para. 16; Fortin v. Chrétien, 2001 SCC 45, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 500, at para. 17; Pearlman v. Manitoba Law Society Judicial Committee, 1991 CanLII 26 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 869, at pp. 887-88; Wigglesworth, at p. 560; G. MacKenzie, Lawyers & Ethics: Professional Responsibility and Discipline (loose-leaf), at § 26:1. The client or patient is often in a vulnerable position in the professional relationship: Pharmascience Inc., at para. 36; Fortin, at para. 17. The public places great trust in the advice and services of professionals: Pharmascience Inc., at para. 36.

[54]                          Disciplinary proceedings are neither civil nor criminal, but rather sui generis: MacKenzie, at § 26:2; Béliveau v. Barreau du Québec (1992), 1992 CanLII 8689 (QC CA), 101 D.L.R. (4th) 324 (Que. C.A.). They maintain discipline within a limited sphere of private activity. Thus, as stated before, they differ from criminal matters, which are of a public nature, intended to promote order and welfare within a public sphere of activity: Wigglesworth, at p. 560; Canada (Attorney General) v. Whaling, 2014 SCC 20, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 392, at para. 45.

[55]                          In disciplinary proceedings, inordinate delay can be harmful to members of professional bodies, complainants and the public in general. Allegations of misconduct against a member can weigh heavily on that person. They can overshadow his or her professional reputation, career and personal life. Anxiety and stress caused by the uncertainty of the outcome and the stigma attached to outstanding complaints are good reasons to investigate and prosecute in a timely way. Disciplinary bodies have a duty to deal fairly with members whose livelihood and reputation are affected by such proceedings: MacKenzie, at § 26:1.

[56]                          Complainants, whether patients or clients, benefit from having their case proceed promptly, so that they can be heard and move on to put the matter behind them. Finally, the public at large expects professionals guilty of misconduct to be effectively regulated and properly sanctioned. Given their role to protect the public from harmful professional conduct, disciplinary bodies must ensure that the public’s concerns are addressed on a timely basis: Wachtler v. College of Physicians and Surgeons (Alta.), 2009 ABCA 130, 448 A.R. 317, at paras. 46-47. 

(b)         The Length and Causes of the Delay

[57]                          When an applicant submits that inordinate delay amounts to an abuse of process, courts and tribunals are called on first to ascertain the length and causes of the delay: Blencoe, at para. 122.

[58]                          The duty to be fair is relevant at all stages of administrative proceedings, including the investigative stage: D. P. Jones and A. S. de Villars, Principles of Administrative Law (7th ed. 2020), at p. 285; Garant, at pp. 655-57; Irvine v. Canada (Restrictive Trade Practices Commission), 1987 CanLII 81 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 181; Syndicat des employés de production du Québec et de l’Acadie v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), 1989 CanLII 44 (SCC), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 879; see, for example, Blencoe, at para. 123. When assessing the actual time period of delay, the starting point should be when the administrative decision maker’s obligations, as well as the interests of the public and the parties in a timely process are engaged. It should end when the proceeding is completed, including the time taken to render a decision.

[59]                          As noted, a lengthy delay is not per se inordinate; it may be justifiable when considered in context. For instance, a case will sometimes involve parallel criminal and administrative proceedings. Some disciplinary proceedings involve allegations of conduct that may be criminal, such as sexual misconduct, fraud and obstruction of justice: MacKenzie, at § 26:5. In some circumstances, disciplinary bodies will proceed while the criminal proceeding are outstanding. In other circumstances, suspension of the disciplinary proceedings to await the conclusion of criminal proceedings can be justified. This can be consistent with procedural fairness and not constitute an abuse of process, even if the delay that results is lengthy.

[60]                          In Sazant v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, 2012 ONCA 727, 113 O.R. (3d) 420 (leave to appeal refused, [2013] 2 S.C.R. xii), for example, allegations against the member involved multiple complainants who were likely to be called as similar fact witnesses in criminal proceedings. The College monitored progress of the criminal proceedings and proceeded to investigate when the criminal charges were stayed. This added to the time for the disciplinary process. However, as the Court of Appeal concluded, it would have been impractical and unfair to the member for the College to pursue disciplinary proceedings arising from the allegations of misconduct against him without waiting for the criminal proceedings to be resolved: para. 245.

[61]                          Besides considering the duration of the delay, the court or tribunal should consider the causes of the delay. This includes whether the applicant contributed to or waived parts of the delay: Blencoe, at para. 122.

[62]                          If the delay was caused by the party who complains of that delay, it cannot amount to an abuse of process: Blencoe, at para. 125; Diaz-Rodriguez v. British Columbia (Police Complaint Commissioner), 2020 BCCA 221, 39 B.C.L.R. (6th) 87, at para. 50; Camara v. Canada, 2015 FCA 43, 91 Admin. L.R. (5th) 13, at paras. 13-14. Nor will there be unfairness if the delay is an inherent part of a fair process.

[63]                          Delay can be waived. This can be explicit or implicit. Thus, if the applicant asked for suspension of the proceedings, or did not object to a suspension of proceedings while other investigations proceeded and acted in a way that unequivocally suggests they acquiesced to such delay, it can constitute a waiver: Diaz-Rodriguez, at para. 51.

[64]                          Finally, whether the administrative body used its resources efficiently should be considered in the analysis of inordinate delay. That said, insufficient agency resources cannot excuse inordinate delay in any case: Blencoe, at para. 135. Administrative tribunals have a duty to devote adequate resources to ensure the integrity of the process: see Hennig v. Institute of Chartered Accountants (Alta.), 2008 ABCA 241, 433 A.R. 221, at para. 31.

[65]                          In sum, the requirements of procedural fairness sometimes slow the pace at which the proceedings progress. Whether the resulting delays are justified will depend on the circumstances of each case.

(c)           The Complexity of the Facts and Issues in the Case

[66]                          The complexity of the facts and issues in a case will affect the time required to decide the matter. For example, sexual abuse allegations might entail difficult and time-consuming investigations. By contrast, large numbers of documents do not necessarily entail complexity, especially in a routine case dealing with issues in which the tribunal has experience. Assessing inordinate delay must account for the wide range of contexts in the administrative system.

(6)         Second Requirement: Significant Prejudice

[67]                          The requirement for significant prejudice is grounded in the foundations of the doctrine of abuse of process in administrative law. If delay alone was sufficient to lead to an abuse of process, it would be “tantamount to imposing a judicially created limitation period”: Blencoe, at para. 101. It is only where there is detriment to an individual that a court or a tribunal will conclude that there has been an abuse of process: Blencoe, at para. 109; Brown v. Assn. of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of British Columbia, [1994] B.C.J. No. 2037 (QL), 1994 CarswellBC 2980 (WL); Stefani v. College of Dental Surgeons (British Columbia) (1996), 1996 CanLII 877 (BC SC), 27 B.C.L.R. (3d) 34 (S.C.); Misra v. College of Physicians & Surgeons of Saskatchewan, (1988), 1988 CanLII 211 (SK CA), 52 D.L.R. 477 (Sask. C.A.). Furthermore, in some cases, delay by itself may be beneficial to the affected party. For example, if the affected party is facing the penalty of disbarment, delay in the administrative process might be welcomed by the affected party, insofar as it enables him or her to continue practicing. These are some of the reasons why the doctrine of abuse of process as it relates to administrative delay requires proof of significant prejudice.

[68]                          The reality is that an investigation or proceeding against an individual tends to disrupt his or her life. This was so in Blencoe, where the majority acknowledged that Mr. Blencoe and his family had suffered prejudice from the moment that sexual harassment allegations against him were made public. The Court concluded, however, that such prejudice could not be said to result directly from the delay in the human rights proceedings, but rather it resulted from the fact that such proceedings were undertaken: para. 133. It is the prejudice caused by inordinate delay that is relevant to the abuse of process analysis. That said, prejudice caused by the investigation of or proceedings against an individual can be exacerbated by inordinate delay. That is to be taken into account: paras. 68-73 and 133.

[69]                          Prejudice is a question of fact. Examples include significant psychological harm, stigma attached to the individual’s reputation, disruption to family life, loss of work or business opportunities, as well as extended and intrusive media attention, especially given technological developments, the speed at which information can travel today and how easy it is to access.

[70]                          In Misra, a doctor was suspended from practice for almost six years, while the College of Physicians and Surgeons chose to wait for years for the completion of criminal proceedings against him before proceeding with the disciplinary process. The criminal proceedings were eventually abandoned. Dr. Misra’s reputation had suffered; he had been unable to practice his profession; his professional prospects were diminished.

[71]                          In Investment Dealers Association of Canada v. MacBain, 2007 SKCA 70, 299 Sask. R. 122, lengthy delays exacerbated the harm to the applicant’s reputation by publicity from a disciplinary investigation. Profits from his business collapsed, then recovered to some degree as publicity around the initial investigation faded, only to be threatened again after the negative publicity around his business was revived years later when the notices of hearing were finally issued: paras. 40-41; see also Financial and Consumer Services Commission v. Emond, 2020 NBCA 42. This is the type of significant prejudice contemplated in Blencoe.

(7)         Conclusion: A Final Assessment

[72]                          The test for whether delay amounts to an abuse of process has three steps. First, the delay must be inordinate. This is determined on an assessment of the context overall. Second, the delay must have caused significant prejudice. When these two requirements are met, the court or tribunal is to conduct a final assessment as to whether abuse of process is established. This will be so when the delay is manifestly unfair to the party to the proceedings or in some other way brings the administration of justice into disrepute: Behn, at paras. 40-41.

[73]                          When an abuse of process is found, several remedies are available.

C.            Remedies

(1)         Introduction to Remedies for Abuse of Process

[74]                          Courts and tribunals must be mindful as to appropriate remedies in the various contexts in which abuse of process can occur: Blencoe, at para. 117; O’Connor, at para. 66, per L’Heureux-Dubé J., writing for a unanimous Court on this point. In this judgment, I will address the main remedies. The list that follows is not intended to be exhaustive. 

[75]                          Remedies for abuse of process can serve several purposes. They can compensate the applicant for the prejudice caused by the delay. They can serve as an incentive for the decision maker to address any problems of systemic delay. Remedies can also express the court or the tribunal’s concern relating to delay in the administrative system.

[76]                          As noted, the doctrine of abuse of process is broad; it can usefully be appreciated on a spectrum: see, in criminal matters, R. v. Regan, 2002 SCC 12, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 297, at para. 107. Various remedies are available, up to and including a permanent stay of proceedings. However, when this high threshold is not met, when there is inordinate delay and resulting prejudice, but it is “not significant enough that proceeding in its wake would, in and of itself, shock the community’s sense of fairness and decency” (Regan, at para. 107), then other remedies are available.

[77]                          Before addressing various remedies for delay amounting to abuse of process, I would make two preliminary points.

(a)           Internal tribunal procedure

[78]                          Addressing delay is an obligation on all parties. As soon as delay becomes a concern, the affected party should seek to use all available procedures to move matters forward. The tribunal may often have internal procedures for dealing with delay; the party complaining of delay should avail itself of these. Even if there are no such procedures, the affected party should raise the issue of delay on the record, by means such as correspondence or oral submissions.

[79]                          In most cases, the affected party should avail itself of the tribunal procedures first. If the affected party does not act in a timely manner to raise concerns about delay, this may be considered in determining the relevant remedy. That said, in considering whether an affected party has sought to move matters forward, one has to be mindful of practical impediments to doing so: see, for example, Wachtler, at para. 44. There may be exceptional cases where the affected party may ask the courts to step in, in accordance with the existing rules.

(b)         Mandamus

[80]                          Mandamus can be sought to compel administrative decision makers to carry out their duties and, in so doing, to limit delay in administrative proceedings: Blencoe, at para. 150. A party who believes he or she is facing undue delay can seek such a remedy, or an order for an expedited hearing, even before an abuse of process exists, rather than “waiting in the weeds” in the hopes of obtaining a stay at some future point: Blencoe, at para. 182. Mandamus may also be ordered as a remedy for an abuse of process if one is found.

[81]                          My comments here do not intend to change any of the standards applicable for obtaining an order of mandamus generally. They merely affirm that it may also be an appropriate tool to prevent and address abuse of process.

[82]                          Also, if used at the right moment, the remedy of an expedited hearing can protect the interests of all parties: Blencoe, at para. 182; D. J. Mullan and D. Harrington, “The Charter and Administrative Decision-Making: The Dampening Effects of Blencoe” (2002), 27 Queen’s L.J. 879 (QL), at pp. 908-9.

(2)         Stay of Proceedings

[83]                          A stay of proceedings is the ultimate remedy for abuse of process. It is “ultimate” because it is “final”; the process will be permanently stayed: Regan, at para. 53. In disciplinary matters, that means that charges will not be dealt with, any complaint will go unheard and the public will not be protected. Given these consequences, a stay should be granted only in the “clearest of cases”, when the abuse falls at the high end of the spectrum of seriousness: Blencoe, at para. 120, citing Power, at p. 616.

[84]                          The decision whether to grant a stay involves a balancing of public interests. On one hand, the public has an interest in ensuring that a tribunal established for its protection follows fair procedures, untainted by an abuse of process. On the other hand, the public has an interest in the resolution of administrative cases on the merits. A balance must be struck between the public interest in a fair administrative process untainted by abuse and the competing public interest in having the complaint decided on its merits: Blencoe, at paras. 118-21 and 154; Conway, at p. 1667; Robertson v. British Columbia (Commissioner, Teachers Act), 2014 BCCA 331, 64 B.C.L.R. (5th) 258, at paras. 78-80; Diaz-Rodriguez, at paras. 71-73; Law Society of Upper Canada v. Abbott, 2017 ONCA 525, 139 O.R. (3d) 290, at paras. 61-63 (leave to appeal refused, [2018] 1 S.C.R. v).

[85]                          When faced with a proceeding that has resulted in abuse, the court or tribunal must ask itself: would going ahead with the proceeding result in more harm to the public interest than if the proceedings were permanently halted? If the answer is yes, then a stay of proceeding should be ordered. Otherwise, the application for a stay should be dismissed. In conducting this inquiry, the court or tribunal may have regard to whether other available remedies for abuse of process, short of a stay, would adequately protect the public’s interest in the proper administration of justice.

[86]                          A stay will be more difficult to obtain where the charges are more serious. For example, in Diaz-Rodriguez, a police officer faced disciplinary proceedings because he used a police baton to repeatedly strike a young man on the head. He also attempted, after the fact, to lay (apparently) unfounded charges, including assaulting a police officer; being intoxicated in a public place; and causing a disturbance: para. 72. The Court of Appeal concluded that in this context, the public interest in fairness in the administrative process did not outweigh the public interest in having the matter proceed to a resolution on its merits: para. 73 (see also: Robertson, at paras. 79-80; R. (J.) v. College of Psychologists (British Columbia) (1995), 33 Admin. L.R. 2(d) 174 (B.C.S.C.), at para. 10). The same was also true in Sazant, in which Dr. Sazant faced allegations of sexual misconduct against children. There was a strong public interest in having the case considered on the merits, despite the length of the delay: para. 248.

[87]                          Even if rare, stays of proceedings are sometimes warranted. An example is MacBain where the charge against an investment dealer did not involve complex factual or legal issues, and he did not contribute to or waive the delay. As well, the Investment Dealers Association failed to provide an explanation for the delay (three years and eight months). When the Court of Appeal heard the case, almost seven years had passed since the commencement of the investigation. Moreover, the member was seriously affected, his business declined greatly, and his personal life was adversely impacted: para. 41.

[88]                          Finally, in the present case, the Court of Appeal considered that the absence of complainants was relevant in the weighing of competing interests; in effect, the absence of complainants favoured for a stay: paras. 209-10. I cannot agree. The absence of a complainant is a neutral factor. The public at large expects a professional who is guilty of misconduct to be effectively regulated and properly sanctioned. A professional misconduct hearing involves more than the interests of those affected; rather one needs to consider “the effect of the individual’s misconduct on both the individual client and generally on the profession in question. This public dimension is of critical significance to the mandate of professional disciplinary bodies”: Adams v. Law Society of Alberta, 2000 ABCA 240, 266 A.R. 157, at para. 6.

(3)         Other Remedies: Reduction in Sanction and Costs

[89]                          When an abuse of process is established, but the abuse is not such that a stay of proceedings is warranted, other remedies may be appropriate: Blencoe, at para. 117; Brown and Evans, at § 9:60.

[90]                          The threshold to grant such remedies will be lower than that required for a stay. While proof of significant prejudice is required to establish an abuse of process, the remedies ordered may vary according to the degree of prejudice. A high degree of prejudice may justify a stay. Lesser, but nevertheless significant prejudice, could justify other remedies. In such cases, the public interest can be properly served by continuation of the proceedings, while the applicant receives some compensation for the abuse that he or she suffered.

[91]                          In the context of a disciplinary tribunal, I will address two further remedies: a reduction in sanction and/or costs.

(a)           Reduction in Sanction

[92]                          When a member is found guilty of professional misconduct, the tribunal must determine the appropriate sanction.

[93]                          As noted, the Law Society’s disciplinary process has as its purposes the protection of the public, regulation of the profession and preservation of public confidence in the legal profession. These purposes are relevant to deciding the sanction to be imposed.

[94]                          A wide range of penalties is possible, from a reprimand to a lifetime revocation of a licence to practice. Various factors, including the presence of an abuse of process, can be considered when determining the appropriate sanction (see J. T. Casey, The Regulation of Professions in Canada (loose-leaf), at § 14:3; J.  G. Villeneuve et al., Précis de droit professionnel (2007), at pp. 246-49; MacKenzie, at § 26:18). Since Blencoe, numerous tribunals and courts have taken abuse of process into account as an attenuating factor in deciding an appropriate sanction.

[95]                          Wachtler provides an example of how delay can be a factor in determining what disciplinary sanctions should be imposed. The Court of Appeal reduced the member’s penalty given the length of the proceedings. The member had received a penalty including a three-month suspension and a costs award against him following disciplinary proceedings by the College of Physicians and Surgeons: paras. 9-10. The Court of Appeal found that the College had failed to properly consider the lengthy delay in the case. The Court of Appeal concluded that although the member had shown that he suffered some prejudice, he was unable to demonstrate that the prejudice was such as would justify a stay: para. 36. Instead, the Court of Appeal reduced the sentence to a one-month suspension (which had already been served) and set aside the costs award: paras. 45-46 and 49.

[96]                          The threshold for a reduction in the sanction will be particularly high when the presumptive penalty is licence revocation. Given the gravity of the misconduct generally required for such a penalty to be imposed, setting it aside might imperil public confidence in the administration of justice, rather than enhance it.

[97]                          For example, in Abbott, the Court of Appeal dealt with a lawyer who had engaged in professional misconduct where licence revocation was the presumptive penalty, as he had knowingly participated in mortgage fraud: para. 17. The Hearing Division of the Law Society Tribunal revoked the lawyer’s licence to practice. Given the lengthy delay in the proceedings, the Appeal Division of the Law Society Tribunal reversed this decision, set aside the penalty of licence revocation and substituted a two-year suspension. The Divisional Court dismissed the appeal from the Appeal Division. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and reinstated the penalty of licence revocation: see paras. 88-90 and 98.

[98]                          As noted, abuse of process can be viewed on a spectrum. To convert a presumptive licence revocation into a lesser penalty requires a significant abuse of process, one at the high end of the spectrum. Moreover, under no circumstances should the adjustment of the penalty undermine the purposes of the disciplinary process, notably the protection of the public and its confidence in the administration of justice. For these reasons, a remedy that substitutes a licence revocation for a lesser penalty will generally be as difficult to receive as a stay. Both may equally undermine a professional body’s responsibility to regulate the profession. 

(b)         Costs

[99]                          Courts faced with applications for review of administrative delay have the discretion to set aside an order of costs against a party or to order costs against the administrative agency. This can be done in the exercise of the court’s discretion relating to costs. As Blencoe illustrates, even where inordinate delay does not amount to abuse of process, it may still justify an award of costs against the agency: para. 136.

(4)         Conclusion

[100]                     A stay of proceedings, a reduction in sanction, or variation of an award of costs are possible remedies. This is not an exhaustive list. Various tribunals may be empowered by their enabling statutes to grant other remedies. They should not hesitate to use such tools to combat inordinate delay amounting to an abuse of process. 

V.           Summary

[101]                     Where delay has not affected the fairness of a hearing, the test to determine if the delay amounts to an abuse of process has three steps:

1.               First, the delay must be inordinate. This is determined on an assessment of the context overall, including the nature and purpose of the proceedings, the length and causes of the delay, and the complexity of the facts and issues in the case; and

2.               Second, the delay itself must have caused significant prejudice;

3.               When these two requirements are met, the court or tribunal should conduct a final assessment as to whether abuse of process is established. This will be so when the delay is manifestly unfair to a party to the litigation or in some other way brings the administration of justice into disrepute.

[102]                     When an abuse of process is found, various remedies are available. In rare cases, where going ahead with the proceeding results in more harm to the public interest than if the proceedings were halted, a permanent stay of proceedings will be justified. When this threshold is not met, other remedies exist, including reduction of sanction and a variation in any award of costs.

VI.         Application to the Present Case

[103]                     The Hearing Committee found that the delay did not amount to an abuse of process given the complexity of the case, the scale of the investigation and the delay that could be attributed directly to Mr. Abrametz’s conduct. The Hearing Committee also concluded that Mr. Abrametz failed to demonstrate that he suffered significant prejudice from the delay.

[104]                     The Court of Appeal substituted its own views with respect to the foregoing, and concluded that there had been an abuse of process such that a stay was warranted.

[105]                     The Court of Appeal did not err in identifying the applicable standard of review: paras. 71-75. However, it failed to apply it properly. Deference should have been accorded to the Hearing Committee as to its findings of fact and of mixed fact and law. It was not. Instead, the Court of Appeal made its own findings of fact. With respect, this was not open to them.

[106]                     Regarding the remedy, the Court of Appeal purported to stay the proceedings; however, while it set aside the penalty and costs award imposed by the penalty decision, it allowed the findings of professional misconduct to stand: para. 217. This unusual result is more akin to a reduction in sanction, rather than a stay. Nonetheless, such an order could only have been made if there was an abuse of process in Mr. Abrametz’s case. The three-step test I have previously described to determine if delay amounts to an abuse of process applies. As I will explain, none of the requirements were met.

A.            The Delay Was Long, But Not Inordinate

[107]                     The audit started on December 4, 2012. The Hearing Committee heard the disciplinary matter between May and September of 2017, and rendered the conduct decision on January 10, 2018. Mr. Abrametz applied for a stay of proceedings on July 13, 2018, that is after the conduct decision, but before the Penalty Hearing was scheduled. The Penalty Hearing took place on September 18, 2018. In the same hearing, the Hearing Committee dealt with the application for a stay. The stay decision was rendered on November 9, 2018.

[108]                     From the start of the audit in December 4, 2012, to the stay decision, on November 9, 2018, about 71 months passed. This delay gives rise to serious concern. However, considered contextually, the delay was not inordinate.

[109]                     The Hearing Committee found that the delay in preparing the report was reasonable. In so doing it had regard to the complexity of the case and the scale of the investigation: at paras. 357 and 364. Further it found that the delay was caused largely by Mr. Abrametz; it noted that 14 ½ months of delay were attributable to Mr. Abrametz or his counsel’s unavailability: para. 360. It also considered Mr. Abrametz’s application to put proceedings on hold pending a different matter before the Court of Queen’s Bench, as well as Mr. Abrametz’s complaint against Mr. Huber, the Law Society’s disciplinary counsel, as contributing to delay: paras. 360-61.

[110]                     While the Court of Appeal acknowledged that it should defer to the Hearing Committee’s findings of fact, it proceeded to do otherwise, on the basis that the Committee has made a series of palpable and overriding errors.

[111]                     The Court of Appeal concluded that the Hearing Committee committed such errors of fact both as to the scale and complexity of the investigation. In arriving at this conclusion, the Court of Appeal reviewed in detail the evidence presented before the Hearing Committee. The court acknowledged that the auditor, Mr. Allen, described his investigation as “considerable” and said it was “exceptionally difficult” and that he produced a final report of more than a thousand pages. However, it concluded that “volume and complexity are not the same”. It found that there is little evidence of what Mr. Allen did during certain periods. The Court determined that Mr. Allen should have finished his report by June 2013 based on the draft report (specifically its page count), the lack of “particulars” of what Mr. Allen did other than complete his trust report, and Mr. Huber’s time records: paras. 182-88.

[112]                     The Court of Appeal further proceeded to make its own findings by analyzing the evidence and, based on this, characterizing each time period so as to determine the time it considered to be undue delay.

[113]                     One must ask, under a deferential standard of review, is this what appellate courts are called on to do? The “primary role” of the Hearing Committee was “to weigh and assess voluminous quantities of evidence”: Housen, at para. 18. An appellate court is not free to interfere with factual conclusions merely because it disagrees with the weight to be assigned to the underlying evidence: para. 23; Benhaim v. St‑Germain, 2016 SCC 48, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 352; Hydro-Québec v. Matta, 2020 SCC 37, at para. 33. An error is palpable if it is plainly seen and if all the evidence need not be reconsidered in order to identify it, and is overriding if it has affected the result: Hydro-Québec, at para. 33; H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 SCC 25, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401, at paras. 55‑56 and 69‑70; Salomon v. Matte‑Thompson, 2019 SCC 14, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 729, at para. 33.

[114]                     The Court of Appeal departed from its proper role when it substituted its own findings of fact, notably on the scale and the complexity of the investigation. The Hearing Committee’s conclusions were grounded in the evidence before it, in particular, the affidavit of the auditor of the Law Society, Mr. Allen. The Court of Appeal gave no deference to the Hearing Committee’s findings, and simply reweighed this evidence and substituted its own findings.

[115]                     The Court of Appeal found that there were errors in the Hearing Committee’s conclusions regarding the delay attributable to Mr. Abrametz: para. 193. However, the Hearing Committee’s finding that, at a certain point, Mr. Abrametz stopped cooperating in the investigation was supported by uncontroverted evidence. There was no proper basis for the Court of Appeal to contradict the Hearing Committee’s attribution of certain delays to Mr. Abrametz.

[116]                     In short, applying the standard of palpable and overriding error, there was no proper basis for the Court of Appeal to set aside the Hearing Committee’s findings that the delay was not inordinate.

B.            There Was No Significant Prejudice to Mr. Abrametz

[117]                     Mr. Abrametz identified four types of prejudice that he said were caused by the delay: the media attention; the practice conditions; the impact on his health; and the impact on his family and employees. The Hearing Committee concluded that none of these claims, individually or cumulatively, amounted to significant prejudice that was caused by the delay. The Court of Appeal disagreed; it concluded that Mr. Abrametz suffered significant prejudice.

(1)         Media Attention

[118]                     The Hearing Committee accepted that Mr. Abrametz’s reputation suffered as a result of media attention, but concluded that he had failed to demonstrate that this arose from the delay rather than the fact that he was subject to investigation and prosecution. The adverse publicity occurred over a short period early in 2018. The Hearing Committee found that the hearing gave rise to media attention, rather than the period of the investigation which preceded it.

[119]                     The Court of Appeal concluded that the Hearing Committee erred by failing to consider that Mr. Abrametz practiced under a cloud of suspicion for more than four years. It considered, in particular, that members of the bar and Mr. Abrametz’s staff knew that he was being investigated and was practicing under supervision as a result of misconduct allegations. This was so because the Law Society publishes information relating to disciplinary proceedings on its website.

[120]                     With respect, the issue is not whether the proceedings were disclosed as they were, but whether Mr. Abrametz suffered significant prejudice from such disclosure. The Hearing Committee found he suffered “some degree of stress”, but not significant prejudice: para. 335. In all this, no palpable and overriding error was identified that warranted the Court of Appeal’s substitution of its own view.

(2)          Practice Conditions

[121]                     Regarding the practice conditions, the Hearing Committee did not accept Mr. Abrametz’s submission that these caused him significant prejudice; the Hearing Committee did so based on the fact that Mr. Abrametz consented to the conditions, they were not overly restrictive of his practice and they were consistent with the Law Society’s mandate to protect the public. It also noted that most of the allegations against Mr. Abrametz were determined to be well founded. The Hearing Committee held that Mr. Abrametz had been unable to provide evidence that he suffered from the conditions in the five years before the disciplinary hearing. He had not argued that the practice conditions impacted his billings or his caseload or the time typically required by him to process his files. Thus, he had provided no evidence that the practice conditions significantly impacted the viability or profitability of his practice.

[122]                     The Court of Appeal took the view that neither Mr. Abrametz’s consent to the conditions nor the fact that he was found guilty of most of the charges were relevant. However, the court failed to address the core of the Hearing Committee’s analysis on this point, which turned on the lack of evidence of any prejudice resulting from the conditions. Mr. Abrametz was not suspended and he continued to practice until the hearing. Thus, the Court of Appeal failed to set out a proper basis for interfering with the finding that Mr. Abrametz did not suffer significant prejudice from the conditions on his practice.

(3)          The Impact on Mr. Abrametz’s Health, Family and Employees

[123]                     The Hearing Committee was not persuaded that the minor medical condition complained of by Mr. Abrametz and the stress experienced by his family and employees were connected to the delay. Here again, no palpable and overriding error was identified that would justify the Court of Appeal’s substitution of its own views.

(4)          Conclusion on the Requirement of Significant Prejudice

[124]                     It was not shown that the Hearing Committee committed any palpable and overriding error when it concluded that Mr. Abrametz failed to demonstrate any significant prejudice. The Court of Appeal erred by interfering with its findings of fact and findings of mixed fact and law. Even if one could view the remedy ordered by the Court of Appeal as a reduction in sanction, and although the threshold to grant such remedy is lower than that required for a stay, proof of significant prejudice is nonetheless required as part of the three-step test to establish an abuse of process. There was no such proof in this case.

C.            Conclusion on Abuse of Process

[125]                     Since the Hearing Committee has not been shown to have erred in its finding that there was no inordinate delay or significant prejudice to Mr. Abrametz, there is no basis to set aside its conclusion that there was no abuse of process in this case. Consequently, it is not necessary to proceed to the next step and consider what remedy should be ordered.

[126]                     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the actions of the Law Society were not above reproach. The Law Society is entrusted with self-regulation of the profession, and by extension an aspect of the rule of law. The Law Society should be keenly aware of the importance of justice being done in a timely way; it should make every effort to safeguard procedural fairness. In all this, the Law Society should set an example for its own members.

VII.      Conclusion

[127]                     I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and remit the matter to the Court of Appeal to address the outstanding grounds of appeal. Costs are awarded to the Law Society in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.

 

The following are the reasons delivered by

 

                    Côté J. —

I.               Overview

[128]                     I have had the opportunity to read the reasons of my colleague Rowe J. I disagree with the majority’s disposition of this appeal. In my view, the delay in these proceedings amounted to an abuse of process, and the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal did not err in quashing the penalty for professional misconduct imposed on the respondent, Peter V. Abrametz (2020 SKCA 81). My disagreement with the majority, however, also extends to the legal principles governing the assessment of inordinate delay in administrative proceedings.

[129]                     Without referring to any precedents on procedural fairness review, my colleague relies on Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, for the proposition that appellate standards of review apply in the present case. Yet our Court’s jurisprudence is clear: the question of whether an administrative decision maker has complied with its duty of fairness is subject to the standard of correctness — regardless of the existence of an appeal mechanism. I see no reason to revisit this well‑established starting point.

[130]                     Nor do I agree with the majority’s reframing of the test for whether administrative delay amounts to an abuse of process. This Court recognized in Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), 2000 SCC 44, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 307, that inordinate delay — on its own — is a breach of procedural fairness and thus abusive. An applicant need not demonstrate “significant prejudice” for unfair conduct to constitute an abuse of process; this requirement applies only where a stay of proceedings is sought.

[131]                     The case law on abuse of process confirms that this common law doctrine focuses on the integrity of the justice system rather than the particular interests of litigants. Inordinate delay, I stress, risks bringing the administration of justice into disrepute. For this reason alone, courts must sanction it whenever it is brought to their attention. They possess a wide range of remedial tools — including declarations, costs, orders for an expedited hearing, reductions in penalty, and stays of proceedings — to grant relief that is proportionate to the abuse of process. In determining the appropriate remedy, courts must consider the length, causes, and effects of delay as well as the public interest.

[132]                     Applying this framework to the case at bar, I agree with the analysis of the Court of Appeal. The appellant, the Law Society of Saskatchewan, subjected Mr. Abrametz to disciplinary proceedings spanning a period of more than 6 years, 32 ½ months of which remain unexplained. The delay grossly exceeded the inherent time requirements of this case; it is plainly inordinate and, as a result, abusive. This undue delay caused serious prejudice to Mr. Abrametz and also affected his employees, all of whom experienced additional stress from the unjustified extension of the proceedings.

[133]                     In these circumstances, the Court of Appeal rightly sanctioned the Law Society’s abuse of process by ordering that the penalty for Mr. Abrametz’s professional misconduct be set aside. I would accordingly dismiss the appeal.

II.            Abuse of Process and Inordinate Delay in Administrative Proceedings

[134]                     I begin my analysis by discussing the framework for assessing abuse of process resulting from inordinate delay in administrative proceedings. I do so because the standard of review depends on the parameters of the test for abuse of process arising from administrative delay. Here, the majority posits that the final assessment of whether delay constitutes an abuse of process is a question of law subject to correctness review, but that findings made with respect to the “requirements” of this test, including inordinate delay, are entitled to deference. Yet as I explain, the doctrine of abuse of process is unencumbered by specific requirements at common law. Inordinate delay is one of the manifestations of abusive conduct that undermines the integrity of the justice system. Therefore, the test for abuse of process arising from administrative delay is based entirely on the “inordinate delay” standard, the application of which is a question of law.

[135]                     To be more specific, the majority purportedly relies on Blencoe in articulating a three‑step test for determining whether delay in administrative proceedings amounts to an abuse of process. The test begins with two requirements: inordinate delay and significant prejudice caused by the delay. Where both requirements are met, there is a final step at which the court must assess whether the delay amounts to an abuse of process because it is manifestly unfair to a party or otherwise brings the administration of justice into disrepute.

[136]                     With respect, I am of the view that this framework rests on a mistaken understanding of the doctrine of abuse of process. Under the majority’s approach, even inordinate delay that directly causes significant prejudice is not per se abusive, as the last step of its test indicates. Not only is this proposition doctrinally flawed, but it results in an unduly elevated standard that is disproportionate to the remedies available for abusive delay, which range from a mere declaration to a stay of proceedings. Simply put, the majority’s test is so onerous that it invites complacency in administrative proceedings.

[137]                     This Court rightly recognized in Blencoe that inordinate delay — on its own — is a breach of the duty of fairness. In my view, courts should distance themselves from such procedural unfairness by calling it what it is: an abuse of process. Prejudice is not a necessary condition for delay to be inordinate, although it may contribute to such a finding. Evidence of prejudice, I add, remains highly significant at the remedial stage, since the remedy must be proportionate to the abuse of process. This is consistent with the central principle laid down by the majority in Blencoe — namely that courts may grant a stay of proceedings only in the “clearest of cases”, where the applicant has demonstrated significant prejudice arising from inordinate administrative delay.

A.           Doctrine of Abuse of Process at Common Law

[138]                     The doctrine of abuse of process “has its roots in a judge’s inherent and residual discretion to prevent abuse of the court’s process” (Behn v. Moulton Contracting Ltd., 2013 SCC 26, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 227, at para. 39; Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79, 2003 SCC 63, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 77, at para. 35). This common law doctrine “is used in a variety of legal contexts” (Toronto v. C.U.P.E., at para. 36; see also Behn, at para. 39). Moreover, the analysis of abuse of process at common law “dovetail[s]” with that of the procedural rights guaranteed in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (R. v. Regan, 2002 SCC 12, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 297, at para. 50; see also R. v. O’Connor, 1995 CanLII 51 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, at para. 71). The remedies for abuse of process at common law may, however, diverge from those available under s. 24(1) of the Charter (O’Connor, at para. 68).

[139]                     The doctrine of abuse of process “is characterized by its flexibility” and “is unencumbered by specific requirements” (Behn, at para. 40; see also Toronto v. C.U.P.E., at para. 42). The test for abuse of process — in all of its applications — is whether the impugned conduct affects adjudicative fairness or would otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute (Blencoe, at para. 115; Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Harkat, 2014 SCC 37, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 33, at para. 106; R. v. Nixon, 2011 SCC 34, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 566, at para. 68; R. v. Anderson, 2014 SCC 41, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 167, at paras. 49‑50; O’Connor, at paras. 60‑64; R. v. Babos, 2014 SCC 16, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 309, at para. 31; Regan, at para. 49; Behn, at para. 39; United States of America v. Cobb, 2001 SCC 19, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 587, at paras. 36‑40; R. v. Scott, 1990 CanLII 27 (SCC), [1990] 3 S.C.R. 979, at p. 1007; R. v. Power, 1994 CanLII 126 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601, at p. 616). In sum, an abuse of process may arise from two often interrelated categories: adjudicative unfairness and harm to the integrity of the justice system.

[140]                     Abuse of process must be disentangled analytically from a stay of proceedings, which is but one of the remedies available at common law to redress abusive conduct (Regan, at para. 53; Blencoe, at para. 117; see also S. Coughlan, “Threading Together Abuse of Process and Exclusion of Evidence: How it Became Possible to Rebuke Mr. Big” (2015), 71 S.C.L.R. (2d) 415, at pp. 425‑29; F. Lowery, “Abuse of Process: The Need for Structure” (2014), 20 Auckland U. L. Rev. 223, at pp. 234 et seq.). It is crucial to draw this distinction because the threshold for demonstrating abusive conduct is much lower than the one for obtaining a stay of proceedings.

[141]                     This Court has established stringent requirements for granting a stay of proceedings due to the “drastic” nature of this remedy (Regan, at para. 53). It is only in the “clearest of cases” that courts may stay proceedings (O’Connor, at paras. 68 and 82; R. v. Carosella, 1997 CanLII 402 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 80, at para. 52; Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Tobiass, 1997 CanLII 322 (SCC), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 391, at para. 59; Blencoe, at para. 118; Regan, at para. 53; R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, at para. 17; Babos, at para. 31; R. v. Sullivan, 2022 SCC 19, at para. 95). An applicant must satisfy the following test to obtain a stay:

(1)      there must be prejudice to the fairness of the trial or the integrity of the justice system that will be manifested, perpetuated or aggravated through the conduct of the trial, or by its outcome;

(2)        there must be no alternative remedy capable of redressing the prejudice; and

(3)        where it is unclear whether a stay is warranted after the first two steps, the court is required to balance the interests in favour of granting a stay, such as denouncing misconduct and preserving the integrity of the justice system, against the interest that society has in having a final decision on the merits (Sullivan, at para. 95; Babos, at para. 32; Regan, at paras. 54‑57; Tobiass, at paras. 90‑92; O’Connor, at paras. 75‑82).

This test also applies to abusive delay in administrative proceedings, as indicated by Bastarache J.’s references to the “clearest of cases” threshold in Blencoe, at paras. 118 and 120.

[142]                     With respect, I am of the view that the majority’s reasons conflate the doctrine of abuse of process with the test for stays of proceedings, which are only a subset of the remedies that courts may order to sanction abusive conduct. The majority thus fails to distinguish between, on the one hand, the test for whether conduct amounts to an abuse of process and, on the other hand, the test for whether a stay of proceedings is warranted in the circumstances (O’Connor, at para. 72). The former is flexible and unencumbered by particular requirements; the court must simply determine whether the impugned conduct undermines adjudicative fairness or the integrity of the justice system. The latter establishes an onerous threshold that is met only in the clearest of cases, where the applicant satisfies specific, stringent requirements.

[143]                     One final point concerning abuse of process is in order. This common law doctrine has always focused on the integrity of the justice system rather than the interests of particular litigants, as Arbour J. underscored in Toronto v. C.U.P.E., at para. 43:

In all of its applications, the primary focus of the doctrine of abuse of process is the integrity of the adjudicative functions of courts. Whether it serves to disentitle the Crown from proceeding because of undue delays (see Blencoe, supra), or whether it prevents a civil party from using the courts for an improper purpose (see Hunter, supra, and Demeter, supra), the focus is less on the interest of parties and more on the integrity of judicial decision making as a branch of the administration of justice. In a case such as the present one, it is that concern that compels a bar against relitigation, more than any sense of unfairness to a party being called twice to put its case forward, for example. When that is understood, the parameters of the doctrine become easier to define, and the exercise of discretion is better anchored in principle. [Emphasis added.]

Stated differently, the doctrine of abuse of process “transcends the interests of litigants and focuses on the integrity of the entire system” (Ontario v. O.P.S.E.U., 2003 SCC 64, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 149, at para. 12 (emphasis added); see also I.A.T.S.E., Stage Local 56 v. Société de la Place des Arts de Montréal, 2004 SCC 2, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 43, at para. 16).

[144]                     In other words, courts must condemn conduct that, if left unsanctioned, would “leave the impression that the justice system condones conduct that offends society’s sense of fair play and decency” (Babos, at para. 35; see also Toronto v. C.U.P.E., at para. 43). This is the primary concern addressed by the doctrine of abuse of process at common law, and it is independent of any prejudice suffered by litigants subject to such abusive conduct.

B.            Abusive Delay in Administrative Proceedings

(1)         Overview of the Blencoe Framework

[145]                     This Court’s decision in Blencoe was a significant jurisprudential step in addressing the issue of delay in administrative proceedings. In that case, Bastarache J., writing for a five‑judge majority, and LeBel J., dissenting in part, both recognized that inordinate administrative delay amounts to an abuse of process, even when the hearing is not unfair to the applicant. Bastarache and LeBel JJ. further agreed that courts possess multiple remedial options to sanction abusive delay under administrative law principles. In my view, their opinions broadly complement each other, and their teachings should be reaffirmed in the present case.

[146]                     As the following passage makes clear, Bastarache J.’s majority opinion focused on the high threshold to be met for an applicant to obtain a stay of proceedings — the only remedy sought by the applicant in that case:

In my view, there are appropriate remedies available in the administrative law context to deal with state-caused delay in human rights proceedings. However, delay, without more, will not warrant a stay of proceedings as an abuse of process at common law. Staying proceedings for the mere passage of time would be tantamount to imposing a judicially created limitation period. In the administrative law context, there must be proof of significant prejudice which results from an unacceptable delay. [Emphasis added; citations omitted; para. 101.]

Relying on the jurisprudence on stays of proceedings, Bastarache J. reaffirmed that the “power [to order a stay] can be exercised only in the ‘clearest of cases’” (para. 118). I note that the guidance provided by Bastarache J. concerning the “clearest of cases” threshold for obtaining a stay of proceedings corresponds precisely to the test for abuse of process laid down by the majority in this case.

[147]                     The threshold for obtaining a stay of proceedings set out in Blencoe may be summarized as follows. First, the delay must be “unreasonable or inordinate” so as to constitute a breach of the duty of fairness (para. 121). Bastarache J. stressed that “[t]here is no abuse of process by delay per se” (para. 121); the delay must be “clearly unacceptable” in the circumstances of the case (para. 115). To determine whether the delay is inordinate, the court must undertake a contextual assessment of “the nature of the case and its complexity, the facts and issues, the purpose and nature of the proceedings, whether the respondent contributed to the delay or waived the delay, and other circumstances of the case” (para. 122). Second, the delay must “have directly caused a significant prejudice” (para. 115). Where both requirements are met, the court must consider whether the public interest favours halting the proceedings (para. 120).

[148]                     LeBel J., for his part, took a more holistic approach to abuse of process arising from inordinate delay in administrative proceedings. While he noted that “[w]hoever asks for a stay of proceedings carries a heavy burden” (para. 180), he focused on the “lower threshold of unreasonable delay that might warrant some kind of judicial action and different, less radical, remedies than a stay in the administrative proceedings” (para. 155). Indeed, LeBel J. stressed that inordinate delay is a breach of procedural fairness and thus abusive. He discussed three possible remedies for abusive delay in administrative proceedings: a stay of proceedings, an order for an expedited hearing, and costs (para. 179).

[149]                     Under LeBel J.’s approach, the court must first balance three contextual factors (as opposed to requirements) in assessing whether the delay is inordinate, at para. 160:

(1)   the time taken compared to the inherent time requirements of the matter . . .;

 

(2)   the causes of delay beyond the inherent time requirements of the matter . . .; and

 

(3) the impact of the delay, considered as encompassing both prejudice in an evidentiary sense and other harms to the lives of real people impacted by the ongoing delay. [Emphasis deleted.]

Where the court concludes that the delay is inordinate, it must turn its attention to the appropriate remedy in the circumstances. The selection of the remedy requires the court to weigh the three contextual factors listed above as well as other competing interests — including those of the community and, where applicable, of other private litigants (para. 178).

(2)         Inordinate Delay Is Abusive — Irrespective of Prejudice

[150]                     As noted above, Toronto v. C.U.P.E. confirms that inordinate delay in administrative proceedings belongs to the category of abusive conduct that undermines the integrity of the administration of justice — regardless of its effects on the interests of litigants (para. 43). It follows that courts may condemn administrative delay as abusive even where there is no evidence of prejudice. However, prejudice remains a highly significant consideration in determining the appropriate remedy.

[151]                     The majority in this case proffers two reasons for its position that “significant prejudice” is required for an abuse of process to arise from administrative delay. Its first justification is that sanctioning abuse of process in the absence of significant prejudice would be “tantamount to imposing a judicially created limitation period” (para. 67, citing Blencoe, at para. 101, where Bastarache J. referred to stays of proceedings only). With respect, this assertion is plainly wrong, and it is symptomatic of the conflation of abuse of process with the remedy of a stay of proceedings. Far from establishing a limitation period, alternative remedies allow the claim to proceed but condemn state conduct that undermines the integrity of the justice system. Indeed, I cannot help but mention the irony in the proposition that LeBel J.’s proposed remedy for abusive delay in Blencoe — an order for an expedited hearing — is akin to a statutory limitation period.

[152]                     I am troubled, to say the least, by the second justification offered by the majority — namely that “delay by itself may be beneficial to the affected party. For example, if the affected party is facing the penalty of disbarment, delay in the administrative process might be welcomed by the affected party, insofar as it enables him or her to continue practicing” (para. 67). It is trite law that professional bodies bear the onus of proving the misconduct of persons subject to their jurisdiction. Those who have done nothing wrong will not “benefit” from administrative delay, even if they are allowed to maintain their practice. It is thus improper for courts to consider the unproven “benefits” flowing from administrative delay, since to do so assumes that applicants are guilty of the disciplinary charges brought against them.

[153]                     In any event, the additional stress caused by inordinately long administrative proceedings may very well be prejudicial, regardless of whether the applicant prevails on the merits. I reiterate that professional bodies, like other administrative decision makers, owe a duty of fairness to professionals subject to disciplinary proceedings. The existence and scope of this duty are independent of the outcome of the adjudication. Inordinate delay — in all cases — is procedurally unfair and thus abusive.

(3)         Remedies at Common Law

[154]                     Where the applicant has demonstrated that the delay is inordinate, the next step in the analysis is for the court to determine the appropriate remedy in the circumstances. Courts possess an extensive arsenal of remedial tools to sanction and redress abusive conduct, ranging from a declaration to a stay of proceedings. The choice of remedy for an abuse of process — be it at common law or under s. 24(1) of the Charter — falls within the trial judge’s discretion (Tobiass, at para. 87; Regan, at para. 117; R. v. Bjelland, 2009 SCC 38, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 651, at paras. 15 and 51; R. v. Bellusci, 2012 SCC 44, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 509, at paras. 17‑18; Babos, at para. 48). As noted above, applicants must satisfy a specific test to obtain a stay of proceedings, but other remedies are not subject to that test.

[155]                     Originally, a stay of proceedings was seen as the only remedy available for an abuse of process at common law (see, e.g., L’Heureux‑Dubé J.’s obiter dictum in O’Connor, at para. 68). However, in Blencoe, Bastarache J. rightly noted that there is “no support for the notion that a stay is the only remedy available in administrative law proceedings”, and he stressed that “[o]ther remedies are available”, without elaborating on them (para. 117). In the context of inordinate delay, LeBel J. mentioned orders for costs and orders for an expedited hearing as alternative remedies.

[156]                     There exist other remedial options at common law to redress abusive administrative delay, including reductions in sanction, orders for the exclusion of evidence, and declarations. Traditional prerogative writs such as mandamus may of course complement these remedies. In short, courts have a wide discretion to grant remedies for abusive conduct that account for the circumstances of each case.

[157]                     The guiding principle in determining the appropriate remedy is proportionality. LeBel J.’s approach in Blencoe requires courts to consider the nature and magnitude of the prejudice as primary factors — alongside the length and causes of the delay — in selecting a remedy proportionate to the abuse of process. As mandated by Blencoe, the applicant must demonstrate “significant prejudice” to obtain a stay of proceedings for inordinate delay in the administrative law context (para. 101), but this standard does not apply to alternative remedies.

[158]                     Under LeBel J.’s approach, prejudice remains an integral part of the analysis in that it dictates the proper judicial response to the abuse of process. The absence of any prejudice entails that, in certain cases, a declaration of abuse of process may be the only appropriate redress. Although less drastic than other remedies, declaratory relief allows the judiciary to distance itself from abusive conduct and to deter administrative decision makers from ignoring delays in subsequent proceedings (Vancouver (City) v. Ward, 2010 SCC 27, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 28, at para. 37).

[159]                     In the final analysis, this approach avoids the unfortunate inference that courts condone inordinate delay where the applicant fails to meet the high threshold of “significant prejudice”. I echo LeBel J.’s vehement criticism of avoidable delays in Blencoe: “Unreasonable delay in administrative proceedings is illegal under administrative law” (para. 162 (emphasis added)). In my view, it is incumbent on courts to condemn such conduct as an abuse of process whenever it is brought to their attention.

III.         Standard of Review

A.           Inconsistency With Khela

[160]                     The majority purports to “clarify” the standard of review applicable to questions of procedural fairness in a statutory appeal. It does so, however, without meaningfully considering Mission Institution v. Khela, 2014 SCC 24, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 502 — the governing authority on this point of law — or any other case relating to the duty of procedural fairness. I see no reason to revisit the foundations of Khela.

[161]                     In Khela, LeBel J. unambiguously confirmed for a unanimous court that “the standard for determining whether the decision maker complied with the duty of procedural fairness will continue to be ‘correctness’” (para. 79; see also Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Khosa, 2009 SCC 12, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 339, at para. 43, referring to Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190; C.U.P.E. v. Ontario (Minister of Labour), 2003 SCC 29, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 539, at para. 100; Toronto v. C.U.P.E., at para. 15 (applying the correctness standard to the issue of abuse of process); Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1999 CanLII 699 (SCC), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, at paras. 55‑62 (applying the reasonableness standard to the “substantive aspects” of the decision only)). Moreover, the framework articulated by this Court for assessing questions of procedural fairness applies irrespective of any appeal mechanism, although the existence of appeal rights is a relevant consideration in determining the content of the common law duty of fairness (Baker, at para. 24).

[162]                     Despite this clear statement in Khela, the majority asserts that “where questions of procedural fairness are dealt with through a statutory appeal mechanism, they are subject to appellate standards of review” (para. 27). This is so, in its view, because of this Court’s categorical direction in Vavilov that appeals are to be decided according to appellate standards of review.

[163]                     But the assertion on which the majority relies was made in the context of substantive review — in which the presumptive standard of review is reasonableness, by contrast with Khela. Indeed, the passages of Vavilov cited by my colleague (at paras. 27‑28) established the principle that “[the legislature] may direct that derogation from the presumption of reasonableness review is appropriate by providing for a statutory appeal mechanism from an administrative decision maker to a court, thereby signalling the application of appellate standards” (Vavilov, at para. 33 (emphasis added); see also para. 36).

[164]                     With respect, the mere reference to Vavilov — a judgment that was rendered in a different context and that excluded procedural fairness review from its purview — does not suffice to oust Khela and other directly applicable precedents. Indeed, in Vavilov, at para. 23, this Court expressly excluded issues of procedural fairness from the framework developed in that case — and rightly so. The central “conceptual basis” for the presumption of reasonableness review in the Vavilov framework is “respect for the legislature’s institutional design choice to delegate certain matters to non-judicial decision makers through statute” (para. 26). Moreover, “the consideration of expertise is folded into the new starting point . . ., namely the presumption of reasonableness review” (para. 58). Neither of these considerations applies where procedural fairness is in issue.

[165]                     First, the duty of procedural fairness exists independently of statutorily confined administrative regimes. It is a “general common law principle” incrementally developed by courts over multiple decades of jurisprudence (Cardinal v. Director of Kent Institution, 1985 CanLII 23 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 643, at p. 653; see also Khela, at para. 82; Canada (Attorney General) v. Mavi, 2011 SCC 30, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 504, at para. 38; Dunsmuir, at para. 87; Mount Sinai Hospital Center v. Quebec (Minister of Health and Social Services), 2001 SCC 41, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 281, at para. 22; Ocean Port Hotel Ltd. v. British Columbia (General Manager, Liquor Control and Licensing Branch), 2001 SCC 52, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 781, at paras. 18‑22; Baker, at paras. 20‑28; Knight v. Indian Head School Division No. 19, 1990 CanLII 138 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 653, at p. 669; Martineau v. Matsqui Institution Disciplinary Board, 1979 CanLII 184 (SCC), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 602; Kane v. Board of Governors (University of British Columbia), 1980 CanLII 10 (SCC), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1105; Attorney General of Canada v. Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, 1980 CanLII 21 (SCC), [1980] 2 S.C.R. 735; Nicholson v. Haldimand‑Norfolk Regional Board of Commissioners of Police, 1978 CanLII 24 (SCC), [1979] 1 S.C.R. 311).

[166]                     The legislature’s delegation of authority to make decisions within a given administrative regime has little to do with the question of whether the process conforms to fairness requirements at common law, or whether such requirements have been ousted expressly or by necessary implication by the enabling statute (see Baker, at paras. 21‑28; Ocean Port, at para. 22). Using Baker as a concrete example, I reject the proposition that an immigration officer empowered by the Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I‑2, to make administrative decisions was entitled to deference from a court applying the common law test for impartiality. In that case, L’Heureux‑Dubé J. rightly circumscribed the scope of deference to the “substantive aspects” of the decision (paras. 55 and 62).

[167]                     In my view, deference to substantive decisions presupposes that the administrative process is fair and thus subject to review by courts on a correctness standard. The proposition that procedural fairness underlies reasonableness review is ingrained in the Vavilov framework itself. This Court emphasized in Vavilov that “the focus of reasonableness review must be on the decision actually made by the decision maker, including both the decision maker’s reasoning process and the outcome” (para. 83). Consequently, courts cannot accord deference to an administrative decision maker who fails to give reasons in circumstances where doing so is required at common law. The same reasoning applies to other types of procedural unfairness as well.

[168]                     Second, the application of common law principles falls squarely within the expertise of the judiciary. For example, this Court stressed in Toronto v. C.U.P.E. that abuse of process in the context of relitigation “is clearly outside the sphere of expertise of a labour arbitrator who may be called to have recourse to [it]” (para. 15; see also C.U.P.E. v. Ontario, at para. 100: “It is for the courts, not the Minister, to provide the legal answer to procedural fairness questions.”). Likewise, this Court’s reasoning in Dunsmuir indicates that courts must have the last word on the application of the duty of fairness, at para. 84:

We can see nothing problematic with a grievance adjudicator considering a public law duty of fairness issue where such a duty exists. It falls squarely within the adjudicator’s task to resolve a grievance. However, as will be explained below, the proper approach is to first identify the nature of the employment relationship and the applicable law. Where, as here, the relationship is contractual, a public law duty of fairness is not engaged and therefore should play no role in resolving the grievance.

[169]                     The standard of correctness must remain the starting point of the analysis in the context of procedural fairness review. The majority’s reliance on the existence of an appeal mechanism as the determinative factor undermines Khela, as it overlooks this starting point. Admittedly, the majority’s approach usually leads to the same result where the enabling statute establishes an appeal mechanism. Since procedural fairness is a legal standard, the assessment of whether an administrative decision maker complied with this duty is a question of law subject to correctness review on appeal (R. v. Shepherd, 2009 SCC 35, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 527, at para. 20; R. v. Dussault, 2022 SCC 16, at para. 26; R. v. Le, 2019 SCC 34, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 692, at para. 23; R. v. Katigbak, 2011 SCC 48, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 326, at para. 68).

[170]                     Nevertheless, the present case illustrates that appellate standards of review significantly diverge from Khela when it comes to remedial issues. I explained above that the choice of remedy for abuse of process is discretionary. It is well established in this Court’s jurisprudence that “an appellate court will be justified in intervening in a trial judge’s exercise of his discretion only if the trial judge misdirects himself or if his decision is so clearly wrong as to amount to an injustice”, and that “where a trial judge exercises her or his discretion, that decision cannot be replaced simply because the appellate court has a different assessment of the facts” (Regan, at para. 117, quoting Tobiass, at para. 87; see also Bjelland, at para. 15; Bellusci, at paras. 17‑18; Babos, at para. 48). This deferential approach is a far cry from the one adopted in this Court’s precedents on the duty of fairness at common law.

B.            Standard of Review Applicable to Questions of Procedural Fairness

[171]                     I acknowledge the need to clarify the framework for determining the standard of review applicable to questions of procedural fairness. Multiple judges and authors have underscored the untenable uncertainty plaguing the jurisprudence on procedural fairness review (see, e.g., Bergeron v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 FCA 160, 474 N.R. 366, at paras. 67‑71, per Stratas J.A. (describing the state of the law as a “jurisprudential muddle”); D. McKee, “The Standard of Review for Questions of Procedural Fairness” (2016), 41 Queen’s L.J. 355). While clarifications are warranted, I believe this Court should draw on its existing jurisprudence to articulate a principled approach.

[172]                     The governing authority on procedural fairness review, as mentioned above, is Khela. In that case, LeBel J. confirmed that the question of whether an administrative body has complied with its duty of procedural fairness is, in principle, subject to correctness review (para. 79). Nevertheless, legislatures may — within constitutional bounds — oust the common law and specify the applicable standard of review by statute (Khosa, at para. 18; R. v. Owen, 2003 SCC 33, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 779, at paras. 31‑33; Vavilov, at paras. 34‑35; Dunsmuir, at paras. 30‑31; see, e.g., Administrative Tribunals Act, S.B.C. 2004, c. 45, s. 58(2)(b)).

[173]                     I now turn to the passages in this Court’s jurisprudence that, according to some judges and authors, have muddled the analysis of the standard of review applicable to questions of procedural fairness. The first source of uncertainty flows from the remark in Khela that the decision maker was “entitled to a margin of deference” and to “[s]ome deference” on specific points, at para. 89:

Section 27(3) [of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act] authorizes the withholding of information when the Commissioner has “reasonable grounds to believe” that should the information be released, it might threaten the security of the prison, the safety of any person or the conduct of an investigation. The Commissioner, or his or her representative, is in the best position to determine whether such a risk could in fact materialize. As a result, the Commissioner, or the warden, is entitled to a margin of deference on this point. Similarly, the warden and the Commissioner are in the best position to determine whether a given source or informant is reliable. Some deference is accordingly owed on this point as well. If, however, certain information is withheld without invoking s. 27(3), deference will not be warranted, and the decision will be procedurally unfair and therefore unlawful. [Emphasis added.]

[174]                     This passage illustrates two important propositions from Khela. First, the content of the duty of fairness may be determined by statute, subject to constitutional limitations. The provision at issue in Khela, s. 27(3) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, S.C. 1992, c. 20, derogates from the general common law right to information in the context of decisions on matters such as inmate transfers, but the Court recognized that this provision does not eliminate the constitutionally‑protected right to habeas corpus. Second, administrative decision makers are entitled to deference regarding their underlying findings of fact. The Court adopted a deferential approach to the highly contextual assessments of risk and reliability upon which decisions under s. 27(3) depend.

[175]                     Although the Court emphasized in Khela that compliance with the duty of fairness is a question of law, it reaffirmed the longstanding principle that courts cannot establish fairness requirements in a vacuum: “. . . the concept of procedural fairness is eminently variable and its content is to be decided in the specific context of each case” (Knight, at p. 682; Baker, at para. 21; Moreau‑Bérubé v. New Brunswick (Judicial Council), 2002 SCC 11, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 249, at paras. 74‑75; Council of Canadians with Disabilities v. VIA Rail Canada Inc., 2007 SCC 15, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 650, at para. 231; Dunsmuir, at para. 79). Accordingly, where the administrative decision maker has made factual determinations with respect to the underlying context, such findings are entitled to deference. Institutional constraints on the administrative decision maker are also important contextual factors (see Baker, at para. 27).

[176]                     The second source of uncertainty flows from this Court’s statement in VIA Rail Canada Inc., that “[c]onsiderable deference is owed to procedural rulings made by a tribunal with the authority to control its own process” (para. 231; see also Baker, at para. 27). In my view, this assertion may be reconciled with more recent jurisprudence and remains good law.

[177]                     Indeed, Khela mandates only that the question of compliance with the duty of procedural fairness be subject to the correctness standard; all procedural rulings falling within the bounds of fairness are entitled to deference. For example, while an opportunity for a party to make submissions may be required at common law in a given context, the administrative decision maker might opt for a hearing, written submissions, or both. Where all three options satisfy the duty of fairness, the reviewing court should not substitute its view for that of the administrative decision maker concerning the most appropriate procedure.

[178]                     As this Court stated in Moreau‑Bérubé, “[e]valuating whether procedural fairness, or the duty of fairness, has been adhered to by a tribunal requires an assessment of the procedures and safeguards required in a particular situation” (para. 74). J. M. Evans, writing extrajudicially, has rightly emphasized that “the duty of fairness connotes a legally imposed minimum, not optimal, standard of procedural propriety” (“Fair’s Fair: Judging Administrative Procedures” (2015), 28 C.J.A.L.P. 111, at p. 121 (emphasis deleted)). Consequently, the reviewing court’s role is not to dictate the “correct” or most “fair” procedure in the circumstances, but rather to ensure that minimum fairness requirements are met.

[179]                     This Court’s jurisprudence on procedural fairness review may thus be synthesized as follows. The reviewing court must apply the correctness standard to questions of compliance with the duty of procedural fairness as defined by the common law or by statute. The requirements of fairness are context-dependent, and deference is owed to the administrative decision maker’s underlying findings of fact. In reviewing procedural issues, the court’s role is to determine whether the proceedings comport with minimum fairness requirements in a particular situation. Stated differently, the court must refrain from dictating what it considers to be the optimal procedure among the options that meet this standard.

C.            Standard of Review in the Context of Inordinate Administrative Delay

[180]                     Applying appellate standards of review, the majority asserts that for questions of procedural fairness and abuse of process in a statutory appeal “the applicable standard of review is correctness” because “[w]hether there has been an abuse of process is a question of law” (para. 30). I agree with this conclusion (albeit for different reasons), but I cannot subscribe to the majority’s articulation of the standard of review in the context of inordinate administrative delay.

[181]                     According to the majority, the standard of palpable and overriding error applies to the two requirements of its test, namely inordinate delay and significant prejudice. The third step of the test, which requires the court to “conduct a final assessment as to whether abuse of process is established” (para. 101), is subject to the standard of correctness.

[182]                     I disagree with the position that courts owe deference to an administrative decision maker’s conclusion on whether delay is inordinate. As discussed above, inordinate delay constitutes an abuse of process on its own; it is the legal standard against which an administrative body’s conduct is measured. I reiterate that the application of a legal standard to the facts is a question of law subject to correctness review (Shepherd, at para. 20; Dussault, at para. 26; Le, at para. 23; Katigbak, at para. 68).

[183]                     My conclusion is buttressed by the jurisprudence on the right to be tried within a reasonable time under s. 11(b) of the Charter. In R. v. Yusuf, 2021 SCC 2, at para. 2, this Court endorsed the Ontario Court of Appeal’s formulation of the standard of review applicable to s. 11(b) rulings: “Deference is owed to a trial judge’s underlying findings of fact. Characterizations of periods of delay and the ultimate decision concerning whether there has been unreasonable delay are reviewable on a standard of correctness” (R. v. Pauls, 2020 ONCA 220, 149 O.R. (3d) 609, at para. 40). Moreover, it is noteworthy that both Mr. Abrametz and the Law Society invoked R. v. Virk, 2021 BCCA 58, 403 C.C.C. (3d) 492, in which the British Columbia Court of Appeal similarly held that the standard of correctness applies to a trial judge’s conclusion on the unreasonableness of delay (paras. 23‑24).

[184]                     Although the remedies for them differ, unreasonable delay at common law and unreasonable delay under s. 11(b) are conceptually equivalent; they represent the same manifestation of an abuse of process. Given that unreasonable delay is a question of law in criminal proceedings, the same must be true in the context of administrative proceedings. As L’Heureux‑Dubé J. concluded in O’Connor, “there is no real utility in maintaining two distinct analytic regimes” for abuse of process at common law and abusive conduct contrary to the Charter (para. 71). Here, and with respect, the majority’s application of a deferential standard of review to the requirement of inordinate delay creates unwarranted incoherence in the law.

[185]                     Therefore, I would articulate the standard of review for assessing delay in administrative proceedings as follows. The reviewing court owes deference to the administrative decision maker’s underlying findings of fact — notably on the length, causes, and effects of the delay. The characterization of periods of delay, the conclusion on whether the delay is inordinate, and the remedy for abuse of process are all subject to correctness review.

IV.         Application

[186]                     In discussing the delay in this case, the majority acknowledges that “the actions of the Law Society were not above reproach” (para. 126). With respect, this is a major understatement.

[187]                     I conclude without hesitation that the magnitude of the undue delay in this case, which amounted to 32 ½ months in total, meets the “clearly unacceptable” threshold established in Blencoe (para. 115). This inordinate delay caused stress and related health issues to Mr. Abrametz, who was also subject to intrusive conditions for maintaining his legal practice. His employees were adversely affected as well by these unjustifiably long proceedings.

[188]                     In my view, the length of the unexplained delay and the extent of the prejudice it caused require a correspondingly serious remedy. I conclude that the Court of Appeal rightly ordered that the penalty imposed on Mr. Abrametz be set aside. His disbarment would not serve the public interest.

A.           Inordinate Delay

[189]                     The Law Society initiated its audit investigation of Mr. Abrametz in December 2012. The Law Society’s auditor, Mr. Allen, completed a trust report about 23 months later, in October 2014. Almost a full year elapsed before the Law Society issued a formal complaint against Mr. Abrametz in October 2015. The parties litigated certain procedural matters before the commencement of the hearing in May 2017. The penalty decision rendered by the Law Society’s Hearing Committee in January 2019 brought the disciplinary proceedings to an end. By then, the proceedings had been going on for approximately 73 months — or just over 6 years since the beginning of the investigation.

[190]                     In my view, the delay was plainly inordinate in the circumstances, and I say this regardless of the standard of review. The Law Society failed to provide justifications for several lengthy gaps, particularly at the investigatory stage, where most of the undue delay occurred. Cumulatively, the periods of unexplained delay are “clearly unacceptable” and thus inordinate within the meaning of Blencoe.

[191]                     In its brief analysis of delay, the Hearing Committee made only findings of a general nature: the investigation was complex and extensive; Mr. Abrametz cooperated with Mr. Allen initially but ceased to do so in May 2015; and around 14 months of delay were attributable to the unavailability of Mr. Abrametz’s counsel. The Hearing Committee did not determine the inherent time requirements of any step in the proceedings, nor did it address the substantial gaps in the investigation in particular.

[192]                     Given the blatantly excessive delay in this case, it was incumbent on the Hearing Committee to carefully assess the justifications for the time taken at each key step of the investigation. It merely referred to the affidavit of Mr. Huber, counsel for the Law Society. But neither this affidavit nor the rest of the record discloses any reasonable justifications for the gaps in the proceedings.

[193]                     I disagree with the majority’s assertion that “[t]he Court of Appeal departed from its proper role” in assessing whether the delay was inordinate (para. 114). In the absence of a thorough analysis by the Hearing Committee, the Court of Appeal rightfully made an independent assessment of the periods of delay at every key step of the proceedings. While the Hearing Committee’s findings of fact are entitled to deference, I reiterate that the characterization of periods of delay and the overall conclusion on whether the delay was inordinate are subject to the standard of correctness.

[194]                     After carefully reviewing the record, I substantially agree with the Court of Appeal’s meticulous analysis, and I accept its conclusion that 32 ½ months of delay in the proceedings were unjustified. This case is not a close call. I agree with the Court of Appeal that “[t]his delay did not marginally overshoot what might have been considered appropriate. . . . [I]t so grossly exceeded the inherent requirements of this case as to be ‘clearly unacceptable’ within the meaning of Blencoe” (para. 197 (CanLII)).

[195]                     Given the Court of Appeal’s thorough analysis, it is unnecessary to review each step of the proceedings in detail. I nonetheless address below the relevance of the Hearing Committee’s findings on the complexity of the investigation and on Mr. Abrametz’s lack of cooperation.

(1)         Complexity of the Investigation

[196]                     The complexity of the investigation cannot account for the Law Society’s inactivity between the beginning of the audit investigation and the issuance of the formal complaint, the period during which most of the unexplained delay occurred.

[197]                     The proceedings started on the right track. In February 2013, only two months into the investigation, the Law Society’s Conduct Investigation Committee (“CIC”) issued a notice of intention to interim suspend Mr. Abrametz based on the information he had self‑reported. This notice referred to all the charges of which Mr. Abrametz was eventually found guilty, almost six years later. Moreover, as early as March 2013, Mr. Allen completed a draft trust report that, according to the Court of Appeal, already contained most of the content and attachments that were used in the final trust report (para. 188). The same month, after negotiating with the CIC, Mr. Abrametz signed an undertaking allowing him to maintain his legal practice under stringent conditions.

[198]                     The final trust report, however, was completed by Mr. Allen no less than a year and a half later, in October 2014. The record contains scant evidence of any work done by Mr. Allen during that 19‑month period, as the Court of Appeal pointed out: there are no “particulars of when Mr. Allen spent . . . time” reviewing client files and other documents, nor is there any “evidence of what he did in 2014, other than the bare fact that he completed his final trust report on October 30, 2014” (para. 19). Given the deficient explanations offered by the Law Society, the Court of Appeal did not err in finding 15 months of unexplained delay between the draft and the final trust report.

[199]                     Similarly, after the completion of the trust report, the Law Society inexplicably took an additional 12 months to issue the formal complaint against Mr. Abrametz in October 2015. The formal complaint, I observe, merely reiterated the charges specified in a report prepared by the CIC — the draft of which was reasonably complete by March 2015, or 4 ½ months after the trust report. Yet from that point, the Law Society took over 7 months to issue the formal complaint, a four‑page document that substantially reproduced the content of its draft report. Mr. Huber’s time records, unsurprisingly, reveal that he worked only a few hours per month on this file during that period. In this context, the Court of Appeal’s conclusion that there were 6 months of undue delay between the trust report and the formal complaint seems inevitable.

[200]                     To recap, by the time the Law Society issued the formal complaint, the investigation had already been plagued by 21 months of undue delay. It is not worthwhile to examine the other steps of the proceedings in detail. Much of the subsequent undue delay may be attributed to the lack of direction in the investigation and, in particular, the undue focus on Mr. Abrametz’s alleged tax evasion.

[201]                     As early as October 2013, Mr. Allen became aware of the tax issue, but his progress was stalled by Mr. Abrametz’s refusal to disclose his financial records the following month. As the Court of Appeal explained, “a decision was made to focus on the tax issue — which the [Law Society] had allowed to languish since . . . October 2013 — rather than expeditiously moving the other charges forward at the same time” (para. 190). The Law Society inexplicably waited until September 2015 to bring an application under s. 63 of The Legal Profession Act, 1990, S.S. 1990‑91, c. L‑10.1, to obtain the financial records sought by Mr. Allen two years earlier.

[202]                     Simply put, the time and resources dedicated to the tax issue — which was far more complex than the charges for conduct unbecoming a lawyer — derailed the proceedings. This emphasis was misplaced because the charges laid out in the formal complaint sufficed to have Mr. Abrametz disbarred. Had the Law Society focused on swiftly bringing these charges from the outset, the investigation and prosecution could have proceeded within a reasonable timeframe. The harm had already been done by the time the Law Society communicated its decision to bifurcate the proceedings in July 2015.

(2)         Cooperation

[203]                     The Hearing Committee noted that “[w]hile the Member initially cooperated with the investigation, that cooperation ceased in May of 2015” (2018 SKLSS 8, at para. 357 (CanLII)). This finding relates to Mr. Abrametz’s resistance to disclosing his tax records — which was evident as early as October 2013, when he refused to respond to Mr. Allen’s tax-related questions. In all other matters, Mr. Abrametz was cooperative. I further note that the bulk of the unexplained delay occurred prior to May 2015.

[204]                     In any event, this finding rests on a mistaken interpretation of The Legal Profession Act, 1990. The Law Society was required by law to make an application under s. 63 to obtain the financial records that Mr. Abrametz refused to disclose. Characterizing Mr. Abrametz as “uncooperative” for reasonably opposing the disclosure of his personal financial records would effectively nullify this procedural protection.

[205]                     It is noteworthy that the Law Society attempted to obtain the same financial records by issuing subpoenas to Mr. Abrametz and his accountants under s. 39 of The Legal Profession Act, 1990. The Court of Queen’s Bench quashed these subpoenas as an abuse of process, holding that the Law Society was improperly seeking to discover documents by circumventing the s. 63 process and related hearing. The need for judicial oversight implies that Mr. Abrametz justifiably opposed the production of his financial records. Given the ambiguity that surrounded the scope of the Law Society’s investigatory powers prior to adjudication, it was an error to conclude that Mr. Abrametz was uncooperative.

[206]                     Not only did the Law Society commit an abuse of process by improperly issuing subpoenas, but it also made a frivolous submission in defending its decision to do so. The Law Society argued that Mr. Abrametz did not have standing to challenge the subpoenas served on his accountants for the production of his personal financial records. Needless to say, conduct of this nature is not conducive to the efficient and timely progression of disciplinary proceedings.

B.            Prejudice

[207]                     The Hearing Committee found that the prejudice in this case did not meet the threshold for obtaining a stay of proceedings. I would not interfere with this finding, although I note that the prejudice was far from negligible. Regarding causation, however, the Hearing Committee erred in asserting that there was no causal connection between the unexplained delay and the prejudice.

(1)         Nature and Magnitude

[208]                     The most detrimental effect of the delay was the stress suffered by Mr. Abrametz and his employees. Mr. Abrametz was monitored for high blood pressure resulting from this stress. Importantly, the Hearing Committee considered this prejudice only in analyzing Mr. Abrametz’s claim under s. 7 of the Charter. I note that the requirements in the s. 7 context are demonstrably higher than the “significant prejudice” threshold for obtaining a stay of proceedings. Indeed, the majority in Blencoe stressed that “anxiety, stress and stigma” do not engage the liberty and security interests protected by s. 7 (para. 97). Nonetheless, it also recognized that “significant psychological harm to a person, or . . . stigma to a person’s reputation” caused by inordinate delay may warrant a stay of proceedings (para. 115).

[209]                     Therefore, it is important to bear in mind that the Hearing Committee’s characterization of the prejudice in this case reflected an onerous Charter standard that Mr. Abrametz did not have to satisfy under the Blencoe framework. The Hearing Committee’s findings that Mr. Abrametz suffered “some degree of stress” and that he had a related “minor medical condition” (paras. 335 and 337) were understandable in discussing s. 7 of the Charter. But such detrimental effects must be taken seriously in assessing the magnitude of the prejudice pursuant to administrative law principles. Moreover, the Hearing Committee acknowledged that Mr. Abrametz’s employees experienced stress throughout the proceedings (para. 338; A.R., vol. I, at p. 352).

[210]                     Read contextually, the Hearing Committee’s assessment of the prejudice does not preclude the conclusion that the detrimental effects suffered by Mr. Abrametz and his employees were serious, even if they were not so significant as to justify a stay of proceedings. In my view, this is the only reasonable interpretation of the circumstances: a sword of Damocles hung over Mr. Abrametz’s professional career for several years — and unduly so for a period of 32 ½ months. This inordinate delay also affected his employees, who worked in precarious circumstances far longer than necessary.

[211]                     The intrusive conditions imposed by the Law Society on Mr. Abrametz’s legal practice constituted an additional form of prejudice, albeit a less serious one. The Hearing Committee erred in considering the fact that “the majority of the allegations lodged against the Member were determined by this Hearing Committee to be well founded” (para. 352). This remark worryingly suggests that the Hearing Committee’s analysis of prejudice might have been tainted by its conclusions on Mr. Abrametz’s guilt. To reiterate, professional bodies owe a duty of fairness to all persons subject to their proceedings — including those in breach of their professional obligations. Inordinate delay is abusive, irrespective of the outcome of the proceedings.

[212]                     Unlike the Court of Appeal, I am not taking account of the reputational harm suffered by Mr. Abrametz. There is no reviewable error in the Hearing Committee’s finding that this harm was caused by the hearing itself rather than by the delay. The Hearing Committee noted that “[t]he Member has not pointed to any publicity, adverse or otherwise, of the proceedings between 2013 and 2018. The publicity occurred over a short period of time early in 2018” (para. 350). With respect, the Court of Appeal erred in interfering with this finding.

(2)         Causation

[213]                     I part ways with the Hearing Committee on the assessment of causation in respect of the stress experienced by Mr. Abrametz and his employees. In the Hearing Committee’s view, there was no causal link between the delay and these detrimental effects. However, this conclusion flowed from the application of an erroneous legal standard of causation. The Hearing Committee stated that it had to be “satisfied that any delay in the investigation or hearing process is the contributing cause to the harm that the Member may have experienced due to the stress” (para. 336 (emphasis added)).

[214]                     Although deference applies to findings on causation, it is wrong in law to suggest that prejudice must have a single contributing cause. Indeed, the Hearing Committee effectively applied a “but for” causation test. Yet this Court stated in Blencoe that causation is established where delay is “a contributing cause” (para. 68 (emphasis added)). In that case, Bastarache J. assumed, without deciding, that the delay had “exacerbated” the stigma suffered, although he expressed doubt about whether reputational damage could depend on the duration of the proceedings (para. 71). LeBel J., for his part, acknowledged that “delay was not the only cause” of the prejudice, but he concluded that the delay had “contributed significantly to its aggravation” (para. 177).

[215]                     Even if we adopt Bastarache J.’s approach to causation in Blencoe, the nature of the prejudice in this case is not akin to reputational damage. Reputation “is quickly ruined and difficult to re-establish” (Blencoe, at para. 71), whereas the effects of stress are continuous, and thus directly dependent on the duration of the proceedings. Common sense dictates that an unjustified delay of 32 ½ months in career‑altering proceedings would, at minimum, be a contributing cause of the stress experienced by the affected person. The Hearing Committee’s findings on the lack of causation thus cannot stand.

[216]                     I note, once more, that the outcome of disciplinary proceedings cannot inform the assessment of prejudice and causation. In this case, the proceedings were not the original cause of the prejudice. Nevertheless, the unexplained delay undoubtedly contributed to the detrimental effects suffered by Mr. Abrametz and his employees by unduly extending the proceedings by 32 ½ months.

C.            Remedy

[217]                     As a preliminary matter, I emphasize that the Court of Appeal did not grant a stay of proceedings, despite its characterization of the remedy it ordered:

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal on the ground that the Hearing Committee erred by dismissing Mr. Abrametz’s application to stay the proceedings as a result of undue delay constituting an abuse of process. The [Law Society] proceedings which were commenced by the Formal Complaint are stayed. In the result, the penalty and costs award imposed by the Penalty Decision are set aside. The findings of professional misconduct stand. [Emphasis added; para. 217.]

A stay of proceedings — the “ultimate remedy” (Tobiass, at para. 86) — annuls the disposition as well as the legal and factual bases on which it rests. By maintaining Mr. Abrametz’s convictions, the Court of Appeal effectively quashed the penalty rather than staying the proceedings.

[218]                     Given the nature of the remedy at issue, I will not address the test articulated by this Court for determining whether proceedings should be stayed (see above, at para. 141). Instead, my analysis focuses on the justifications for setting aside Mr. Abrametz’s penalty. I am of the view that the Court of Appeal ordered the correct remedy in the circumstances of this case.

[219]                     The guiding principle in selecting the remedy for an abuse of process is proportionality. Courts have multiple remedial options at their disposal, ranging from a declaration to a stay of proceedings. The remedy must be proportionate to the severity of the abusive conduct, having regard to the length of the unexplained delay and the nature and magnitude of the prejudice it caused. Considerations relating to the public interest complement this contextual analysis.

[220]                     In this case, the length of the inordinate delay militates in favour of a strong remedy. Simply put, the Law Society demonstrably failed to comply with its duty of procedural fairness toward Mr. Abrametz. The periods of unexplained delay substantially exceeded the inherent time requirements of the case and are “clearly unacceptable” within the meaning of Blencoe. In my view, courts should not hesitate to condemn such procedural unfairness. Accordingly, the remedy of setting aside the penalty is apposite because it signals to the Law Society — and to administrative bodies more generally — that unacceptable delay brings the administration of justice into disrepute.

[221]                     The prejudice in this case does not meet the high threshold required for a stay of proceedings, but it is far from negligible. For an unexplained period of 32 ½ months, Mr. Abrametz and his employees experienced undue stress arising from these career-altering disciplinary proceedings. Mr. Abrametz was monitored for high blood pressure, a medical condition attributable to these stressful circumstances. He was also subject to intrusive conditions in order to maintain his legal practice. These prejudicial effects, taken together, are serious.

[222]                     Overall, the nature and magnitude of the prejudice, considered in light of the length of the unexplained delay, warrant a correspondingly serious remedy, if perhaps not a stay. This factor thus supports the quashing of the penalty imposed by the Hearing Committee.

[223]                     Finally, the public interest would not be served by maintaining the penalty imposed by the Law Society on Mr. Abrametz. It is true that he was found guilty of serious breaches of his professional obligations. However, multiple considerations convince me that the protection of the public does not require Mr. Abrametz’s disbarment at this point. The Law Society took swift action to impose stringent conditions on his legal practice in order to prevent further misconduct. He was closely monitored by the Law Society for over four years — during which time his conduct was exemplary, according to the Hearing Committee (para. 395). Prior to the misconduct investigated by the Law Society, Mr. Abrametz was a longstanding practitioner with no disciplinary record. Additionally, I note that none of his clients complained of his actions.

[224]                     In short, Mr. Abrametz has already paid a hefty price for his misconduct, and he has proved that his practice is no longer a matter of concern for the protection of the public. The remedy ordered by the Court of Appeal does not annul the proceedings or their outcome, as a stay would. The consequences of staying the proceedings would be much more serious: “Charges that are stayed may never be prosecuted; an alleged victim will never get his or her day in court; society will never have the matter resolved by a trier of fact” (Regan, at para. 53). Here, the allegations of professional misconduct were debated at a public hearing that attracted media attention. The Hearing Committee’s findings of guilt stand — as does the stigma flowing from them. These convictions leave an indelible mark on Mr. Abrametz’s disciplinary record, which may be accessed by members of the public at their convenience. In this context, the justifications for punishing Mr. Abrametz no longer hold; the penalty of disbarment would not be in the public interest.

V.           Conclusion

[225]                     No less than 6 years elapsed between the beginning of the Law Society’s audit investigation and its penalty decision, 32 ½ months of which were unjustified. This inordinate delay caused serious prejudice to Mr. Abrametz and his employees. In these circumstances, the Court of Appeal correctly sanctioned this abuse of process by ordering that the penalty for professional misconduct — but not the convictions themselves — be set aside.

[226]                     For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

I.               Overview

[1]                             Does the Copyright Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-42, require that users pay two royalties to access works online, even though accessing the same work offline requires paying only one royalty?

[2]                             The answer to this question depends on the correct interpretation of s. 2.4(1.1) of the Copyright Act. Section 2.4 (1.1) modifies the definition of s. 3(1)(f) by holding a work is communicated to the public as soon as it is made available in a way “that allows a member of the public to have access to it from a place and at a time individually chosen by that member of the public”. The Copyright Board of Canada concluded that s. 2.4(1.1) deems the act of making works available to be a separately protected and compensable activity. In practical terms, this meant that users needed to pay two royalties to access works online — a royalty for “making works available” and an additional royalty when the work was actually downloaded or streamed. The Board reasoned that this was the only interpretation that would fulfill Canada’s obligations under art. 8 of the 1996 WIPO Copyright Treaty, Can. T.S. 2014 No. 20, which requires that member countries give authors the exclusive right to control the act of making works available.

[3]                             The Federal Court of Appeal overturned the Board’s decision. It concluded that the Board focused too much on art. 8’s meaning, rather than s. 2.4(1.1)’s meaning. Had it properly interpreted s. 2.4(1.1), the Board would have seen that Parliament did not intend to subject downloads and streams to two royalties.

[4]                             The appellants, the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (“SOCAN”) and Music Canada, ask that this Court overturn the Court of Appeal’s decision and adopt the Board’s interpretation of s. 2.4(1.1).

[5]                             I cannot agree with the Board’s interpretation of s. 2.4(1.1). The Copyright Act does not exist solely for the benefit of authors. Its overarching purpose is to balance authors’ and users’ rights by securing just rewards for authors while facilitating public access to works. When this balance is achieved, society is enriched. Authors are encouraged to produce more works, and users gain access to works which they can use to inspire their own original artistic and intellectual creations.

[6]                             The principle of technological neutrality helps the Copyright Act balance the rights of authors and users. This principle holds that, absent parliamentary intent to the contrary, the Copyright Act should not be interpreted so as to favour or discriminate against any form of technology. It protects authors and users by ensuring that works attract the same rights and give rise to the same royalties regardless of the technological means used to distribute the works.

[7]                             The Board’s interpretation departs from the principle of technological neutrality. It requires that users pay additional royalties to access works online. Requiring that users pay additional royalties based on the mode of the work’s distribution violates the principle of technological neutrality and shifts the balance between users’ and authors’ rights that has underpinned the Copyright Act for decades decisively in favour of authors.

[8]                             The Board’s interpretation is not required by art. 8 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty. The Board’s interpretation of s. 2.4(1.1) would fulfill Canada’s obligations under art. 8. But other interpretations of s. 2.4(1.1) that are more consistent with its text, context, and purpose also conform to art. 8. In my view, s. 2.4(1.1) clarifies two things: (1) s. 3(1)(f) applies to on-demand technologies, and (2) a work is performed as soon as it is made available for online streaming. This interpretation of s. 2.4(1.1) is technologically neutral and allows Canada to fulfill its obligations under art. 8 through a combination of the performance, reproduction, and authorization rights in s. 3(1). If a work is streamed or made available for on-demand streaming, the author’s performance right is engaged. If a work is downloaded, the author’s reproduction right is engaged. If a work is made available for downloading, the author’s right to authorize reproductions is engaged. There are no gaps in protection.

[9]                             As this interpretation of s. 2.4(1.1) is more consistent with its text, context, and purpose, I would adopt it over the Board’s. If a work is downloaded or made available for downloading, s. 3(1)(f) is not engaged. If a work is made available for streaming and later streamed, s. 3(1)(f) is only engaged once. It follows that I would dismiss the appeal.

II.            Facts

[10]                        In 1997, Canada signed the WIPO Copyright Treaty. The WIPO Copyright Treaty is one of two treaties negotiated in 1996 for the purpose of adapting international copyright rules to new and emerging technologies.

[11]                        The WIPO Copyright Treaty sets out a number of protections that member countries are to provide to authors. Of relevance to this appeal is art. 8, which provides that,

     [w]ithout prejudice to the provisions of Articles 11(1)(ii), 11bis(1)(i) and (ii), 11ter(1)(ii), 14(1)(ii) and 14bis(1) of the Berne Convention, authors of literary and artistic works shall enjoy the exclusive right of authorizing any communication to the public of their works, by wire or wireless means, including the making available to the public of their works in such a way that members of the public may access these works from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.

[12]                        In 2012, the Copyright Modernization Act, S.C. 2012, c. 20 (“CMA”), amended the Copyright Act. Among other changes, the CMA introduced three “making available” provisions: ss. 2.4(1.1), 15(1.1)(d), and 18(1.1)(a). Sections 15(1.1)(d) and 18(1.1)(a) apply to performances and sound recordings and are not at issue in this appeal.[1] Section 2.4(1.1) applies to original works. It amends s. 3(1)(f) — which gives authors the right to “communicate the work to the public by telecommunication” — by clarifying that,

     [f]or the purposes of [the Copyright Act], communication of a work or other subject˗matter to the public by telecommunication includes making it available to the public by telecommunication in a way that allows a member of the public to have access to it from a place and at a time individually chosen by that member of the public.

[13]                        Shortly after the CMA received royal assent, but before it came into force, this Court released two important decisions on the scope of s. 3(1)(f): Entertainment Software Association v. Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada, 2012 SCC 34, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 231 (“ESA”), and Rogers Communications Inc. v. Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada, 2012 SCC 35, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 283. ESA held that the transmission of a musical work over the Internet that results in a download is not a communication by telecommunication under s. 3(1)(f). Rogers concluded that on-demand streams were captured by s. 3(1)(f).

[14]                        After ESA and Rogers were released and after the CMA came into force, the Board received submissions on the meaning of s. 2.4(1.1). SOCAN, which administers the s. 3(1)(f) right to “communicate” musical works on behalf of copyright owners, submitted that s. 2.4(1.1) requires that users pay tariffs[2] (i.e., royalties) when they post works on the Internet in a way that allows the public to access the work. These royalties would be payable irrespective of whether the works are subsequently transmitted to a member of the public by way of download, stream, or not at all.

III.         Decisions Below

A.           Copyright Board of Canada, 2017 CanLII 152886

[15]                        The Board accepted SOCAN’s position. It reasoned that s. 2.4(1.1) deems making a work available to be a “communication” to the public regardless of whether any subsequent transmission occurs and regardless of whether a subsequent transmission is a download or a stream. This meant that two royalties would be payable when a work is distributed online: (1) when it is made available online and (2) when the work is actually streamed or downloaded. The Board’s reasoning relied heavily on art. 8 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty, which it read as requiring that member countries provide a separate and compensable protection for the act of “making a work available”.

B.            Federal Court of Appeal, 2020 FCA 100, [2021] 1 F.C.R. 374 (Pelletier, Stratas and Near JJ.A.)

[16]                        The Federal Court of Appeal held that the Board’s decision was unreasonable. Regarding the standard of review, the Court of Appeal noted that the jurisprudence prior to Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, required reviewing the Board’s interpretation of s. 2.4(1.1) on a standard of correctness. However, after Vavilov, this jurisprudence was uncertain. While the Court of Appeal identified strong reasons for reviewing the Board’s decision on a standard of correctness, it applied the standard of reasonableness because it had not received submissions on the issue.

[17]                        The Court of Appeal concluded that the Board placed too much weight on art. 8 when interpreting s. 2.4(1.1). Rather than focusing on what art. 8 means, the Board should have focused on what s. 2.4(1.1) means. Had it done so, the Board would have seen that Parliament did not intend to create a new compensable making available right.

[18]                        While the Court of Appeal rejected the Board’s interpretation of s. 2.4(1.1), it did not explain what s. 2.4(1.1) means — it simply rejected the Board’s interpretation of s. 2.4(1.1) and quashed the Board’s decision.

IV.         Parties’ Positions

A.           Appellants

[19]                        The appellants ask this Court to affirm the Board’s interpretation of s. 2.4(1.1). They argue that the Board correctly concluded that s. 2.4(1.1) deems the act of making works available to be a “communication” under s. 3(1)(f). A royalty is therefore payable whenever a work is made available for downloading or streaming. If the work is later downloaded, another reproduction royalty is payable. If the work is later streamed, another performance royalty is payable.

B.            Respondents

[20]                        The respondents ask this Court to reject the Board’s interpretation of s. 2.4(1.1). They argue that s. 2.4(1.1) does not require that users pay two royalties to download or stream works. If a work is downloaded, only a single reproduction royalty is payable. If a work is streamed, only a single performance royalty is payable. Correctly interpreted, s. 2.4(1.1) simply clarifies that a work is “performed” as soon as it is “made available” for on-demand streaming. At that point, a royalty is payable. If the work is later streamed by a user, no additional royalty is payable because the stream is part of one continuous act of performance that began when the work was “made available” for streaming.

V.           Issues

[21]                        This appeal raises three issues:

(a)     What is the appropriate standard of review?

(b)   What role does the WIPO Copyright Treaty play in interpreting s. 2.4(1.1)?

(c)   Does s. 2.4(1.1) entitle authors to an additional “making available” royalty?

VI.         Analysis

A.           Issue 1: What Is the Appropriate Standard of Review?

(1)         Prior Jurisprudence Needs to Be Reconsidered in Light of Vavilov

[22]                        Prior to Vavilov, the Board’s decisions on the scope of rights in the Copyright Act were reviewed on the standard of correctness: see, for example, Rogers, at paras. 10-20; Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. SODRAC 2003 Inc., 2015 SCC 57, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 615 (“CBC”), at para. 35.

[23]                        These pre-Vavilov cases held that correctness was appropriate because the Board and courts have concurrent first instance jurisdiction over some aspects of the Copyright Act. In infringement actions, the scope of rights under the Act is routinely brought before courts for interpretation. Similarly, the Board may need to decide the scope of rights in the Act in order to set tariffs, as occurred in this case: Rogers, at paras. 12-13. Given this shared jurisdiction, the pre-Vavilov cases concluded that correctness was appropriate because it minimized the risk of conflicting statutory interpretations and gave effect to legislative intent: Rogers, at paras. 12-15; CBC, at para. 35.

[24]                        In Vavilov, this Court reconsidered its standard of review jurisprudence. It simplified the law by holding that courts should review administrative decisions on a standard of reasonableness except when doing so would undermine legislative intent or the rule of law: paras. 17 and 69.

[25]                        Vavilov overtook the prior jurisprudence: para. 143. Cases from this Court applying a correctness standard to the Board’s decisions therefore need to be reconsidered in light of Vavilov.

(2)         Concurrent First Instance Jurisdiction Should Be Recognized as a Sixth Category of Correctness

[26]                        Vavilov recognized five categories for correctness review: legislated standards of review, statutory appeal mechanisms, constitutional questions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole, and questions related to the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies (paras. 17 and 69). None of these categories justifies applying a correctness standard of review to situations of concurrent administrative and court first instance jurisdiction.

[27]                        Nevertheless, I would apply a correctness standard of review to the Board’s decision. Vavilov did not “definitively foreclose the possibility that another category could be recognized as requiring a derogation from the presumption of reasonableness review”: Vavilov, at para. 70. In rare and exceptional circumstances, new correctness categories can be recognized when applying reasonableness would undermine legislative intent or the rule of law in a manner analogous to the five correctness categories discussed in Vavilov at paras. 23 and 70.

[28]                        This is one of those rare and exceptional circumstances where it is appropriate to recognize a new category of correctness review: when courts and administrative bodies have concurrent first instance jurisdiction over a legal issue in a statute. Applying correctness to these issues accords with legislative intent and promotes the rule of law.

(a)           Legislative Intent

[29]                        Reasonableness is the standard of review that, in most instances, gives best effect to legislative intent. When the legislature has granted exclusive jurisdiction to an administrative decision maker, courts presume that the legislature wanted that decision maker to operate without undue judicial interference: Vavilov, at para. 24.

[30]                        When the legislature expressly involves the court in the administrative scheme, this presumption no longer applies. That is why legislated standards of review and statutory appeal mechanisms give rise to a correctness standard of review. Such statutory features indicate legislative intent for judicial involvement and a desire to subject those decisions to appellate standards of review: Vavilov, at para. 36.

[31]                        When the legislature enacts a statute that gives concurrent first instance jurisdiction to courts and administrative bodies, the legislature expressly involves the courts. Like legislated standards of review and statutory appeal mechanisms, concurrent first instance jurisdiction signals a legislative intent for judicial involvement. By conferring such jurisdiction, it should be inferred that the legislature wanted to subject those decisions to appellate standards of review.

[32]                        My colleague suggests that, because there is no statutory appeal mechanism or legislated standard of review, a sixth correctness category cannot be recognized on the basis of legislative intent. With respect, this argument misconceives the question at issue. If there were legislated standards of review or statutory appeal mechanisms, the Board’s decision would already be reviewed for correctness under those established correctness categories. There would be no reason to consider a sixth category of correctness. When there is no statutory appeal mechanism or legislated standard of review (or other established correctness category), the question is whether correctness is nevertheless appropriate because applying reasonableness would undermine legislative intent in a manner analogous to the established correctness categories. Since that is the case here, a sixth category of correctness is justified on the basis of legislative intent.

(b)         Rule of Law

[33]                        The presumption of reasonableness must give way to considerations aimed at maintaining the rule of law, which requires that certain questions be answered consistently and definitively: Vavilov, at para. 53. Legal inconsistency “is antithetical to the rule of law”: Vavilov, at para. 72.

[34]                        Applying reasonableness to the Board’s interpretation of the rights in the Copyright Act creates two legal inconsistencies. First, it subjects the same legal issue to different standards of review depending solely on whether the issue arises before the Board or the courts. As this Court explained in Rogers, at para. 14,

     [i]t would be inconsistent for the court to review a legal question on judicial review of a decision of the Board on a deferential standard and decide exactly the same legal question de novo if it arose in an infringement action in the court at first instance. It would be equally inconsistent if on appeal from a judicial review, the appeal court were to approach a legal question decided by the Board on a deferential standard, but adopt a correctness standard on an appeal from a decision of a court at first instance on the same legal question.

[35]                        Second, differing standards of review could lead to conflicting statutory interpretations. For example, the Board could interpret s. 2.4(1.1) as requiring that users pay a performance royalty when works are downloaded, while a court could interpret the provision such that no such royalties are payable in those circumstances.

[36]                        This raises different concerns than the potential for inconsistent decisions within an administrative body. In Vavilov, at para. 72, this Court declined to recognize a correctness category for legal questions on which there is persistent discord within an administrative body for three reasons: (1) ensuring that administrative bodies remain independent, as the legislature intended, requires tolerating some inconsistencies; (2) a robust reasonableness review can adequately manage the serious rule of law concerns that emerge when the law is indeterminate; and (3) the point at which internal discord becomes serious enough to warrant a correctness standard is impossible to define in the abstract. None of these rationales justifies maintaining a reasonableness standard of review when courts and administrative bodies have concurrent first instance jurisdiction.

[37]                        First, when there is concurrent first instance jurisdiction, the legislature has expressly involved the courts in the interpretation of a statute. While one may contemplate a degree of inconsistency within an administrative body regarding the interpretation of a statute, no such inconsistency can be tolerated when a court interprets a statute. When the legislature confers first instance concurrent jurisdiction, that necessarily carries with it the implication that, absent legislative direction to the contrary, courts will operate by their settled standards, as explained in Vavilov, at para. 37.

[38]                        Second, the more methodologically rigorous reasonableness review developed in Vavilov cannot adequately deal with an inconsistency in statutory interpretation between courts and administrative bodies. Vavilov offered guidance as to how to manage persistent discord within administrative bodies at paras. 129-32. But, other than telling administrative bodies to consider relevant judicial decisions, at para. 112, it offers little guidance on managing differing decisions between courts and tribunals. In those circumstances, unless the statute allows for only one reasonable interpretation, discord could persist indefinitely: see para. 124.

[39]                        Third, this correctness category can be defined with precision. It will apply when courts and administrative bodies have concurrent first instance jurisdiction over a legal issue in a statute. Such situations are rare. “Concurrent jurisdiction at first instance seems to appear only under intellectual property statutes where Parliament has preserved dual jurisdiction between the tribunals and the courts”: Rogers, at para. 19. Administrative bodies will also continue to benefit from the presumption of reasonableness in other circumstances. The Board’s decision on tariff rates, for example, will continue to be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness as that is a matter that comes within the Board’s exclusive jurisdiction.

(3)         Conclusion: Standard of Review

[40]                        Recognizing concurrent first instance jurisdiction between courts and administrative bodies as a sixth category of correctness review gives effect to legislative intent and promotes the rule of law. I will therefore review the Board’s decision under the standard of correctness.

[41]                        I wish to emphasize that these reasons do not purport to change when it is appropriate to recognize a new correctness category. Vavilov contemplated that new correctness categories could be recognized only in rare and exceptional circumstances. Courts should only recognize new correctness categories when doing so is “consistent with the framework and the overarching principles set out in [Vavilov]”: para. 70. This is one of those circumstances.

[42]                        Nor do these reasons depart from Vavilov. Contrary to my colleague’s assertion, this Court never “chose not to make first instance concurrent jurisdiction an exception”: para. 125 (emphasis in original). When this Court wanted to reject the possibility of a certain correctness category, it did so expressly: see Vavilov, at paras. 71-72. Concurrent first instance jurisdiction was not discussed in Vavilov. Accordingly, I seek to give effect to Vavilov by considering whether treating concurrent first instance jurisdiction as a new correctness category furthers the framework and principles in Vavilov. With respect, I say that it is my colleague who departs from precedent by effectively reading the possibility of further correctness categories out of Vavilov.

B.            Issue 2: What Role Does the WIPO Copyright Treaty Play in the Interpretation of Section 2.4(1.1)?

[43]                        The Court of Appeal criticized the Board for focusing on the meaning of art. 8 in the WIPO Copyright Treaty, rather than the meaning of s. 2.4(1.1) in the Copyright Act. The parties also disagree on how much focus should be placed on art. 8. This case therefore calls for a reiteration of the role international treaties play in statutory interpretation.

(1)         A Treaty Is Relevant at the “Context” Stage of Statutory Interpretation

[44]                        A treaty should be considered when interpreting statutes that purport to implement the treaty, in whole or in part. The treaty is relevant at the context stage of the statutory interpretation exercise: Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1999 CanLII 699 (SCC), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, at para. 70; B010 v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 SCC 58, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 704, at para. 49; R. Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (6th ed. 2014), at §18.30.

[45]                        There is no need to find textual ambiguity in a statute before considering the treaty. The modern approach to statutory interpretation requires interpreting the statute’s text in its “entire context”. The statute’s context includes any relevant international legal obligations: National Corn Growers Assn. v. Canada (Import Tribunal), 1990 CanLII 49 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1324, at pp. 1371-72; Crown Forest Industries Ltd. v. Canada, 1995 CanLII 103 (SCC), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 802, at para. 50; Sullivan, at §18.26.

[46]                        If a statute implements a treaty without qualification, the interpretation of the statute needs to be wholly consistent with Canada’s obligations under the treaty: Office of the Children’s Lawyer v. Balev, 2018 SCC 16, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 398, at para. 31. If the statute is less explicit as to the extent to which it gives effect to a treaty, the weight given to obligations under the treaty will depend on the circumstances of the case, such as the treaty’s specificity and the statute’s text: Rahaman v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 FCA 89, [2002] 3 F.C. 537, at para. 36. Where the text permits, legislation should be interpreted so as to comply with Canada’s treaty obligations, in accordance with the presumption of conformity: R. v. Hape, 2007 SCC 26, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 292, at para. 53; Németh v. Canada (Justice), 2010 SCC 56, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 281, at para. 34; B010, at para. 48.

(2)         Courts Must Always Give Effect to the Statute’s Meaning

[47]                        The presumption of conformity is an aid to interpretation. The task remains to give effect to legislative intent. The separation of powers requires that courts give effect to a statute that demonstrates legislative intent not to comply with treaty obligations: Hape, at para. 53. Negotiation, signing, and ratification of treaties are acts of the executive. Once ratified, treaties do not automatically become part of domestic law; rather, they are given effect through domestic legislation: Sullivan, at §18.36.

[48]                        Accordingly, while a treaty can be highly relevant to statutory interpretation, it cannot overwhelm clear legislative intent. The court’s task is to interpret what the legislature (federally and provincially) has enacted and not subordinate this to what the federal executive has agreed to internationally. It is always the domestic statute that governs because “[i]nternational law cannot be used to support an interpretation that is not permitted by the words of the statute”: Kazemi Estate v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 2014 SCC 62, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 176, at para. 60.

(3)         Application

[49]                        Article 8 forms a relevant part of the context of s. 2.4(1.1). The CMA’s preamble states that it was enacted in part to implement the “norms” of the WIPO Copyright Treaty. The wording of art. 8 and s. 2.4(1.1) is similar. As well, shortly after Parliament passed the CMA, Canada ratified the WIPO Copyright Treaty. An explanatory memorandum placed before the House of Commons regarding the treaty states that “Canada’s recent [CMA] was developed with a view to implementing the rights and protections of the WIPO Copyright Treaty, thereby putting Canada in a position to ratify”: condensed book (Music Canada), at p. 15. I am satisfied that these facts indicate that Parliament intended to fulfill Canada’s obligations under art. 8 through s. 2.4(1.1). That provision should therefore be interpreted so as to fulfill Canada’s obligations under art. 8, to the extent possible given the Copyright Act’s text.

C.            Issue 3: Does Section 2.4(1.1) Entitle Authors to an Additional “Making Available” Royalty?

[50]                        The Board concluded that s. 2.4(1.1) deems making a work available to be a “communication” under s. 3(1)(f), regardless of whether any subsequent transmission occurs and regardless of whether a subsequent transmission is a download or a stream. Therefore, the Board reasoned, as soon as a work is made available online, s. 3(1)(f) is triggered and a royalty is payable. If the work is later downloaded or streamed, another royalty is payable. This interpretation means that distributing works online requires paying two royalties — one when the work is made available and another when the work is downloaded or streamed.

[51]                        I am not persuaded that this is the proper reading of s. 2.4(1.1). While this interpretation is one means to fulfill Canada’s obligations under art. 8, it is inconsistent with the text, structure and purpose of the Copyright Act. Further, art. 8 does not require this interpretation. If s. 2.4(1.1) is read as clarifying two things — (1) that s. 3(1)(f) applies to on-demand streams and (2) a work is performed as soon as it is made available for streaming — then Canada would also fulfill its obligations under art. 8. Either interpretation would fulfill Canada’s obligations under art. 8, but the latter interpretation is more consistent with the text, structure and purpose of the Copyright Act. For that reason, it is the latter interpretation, not the one adopted by the Board, that should be given effect.

[52]                        My analysis in this section will proceed in five parts. I will explain why the Board’s interpretation (1) is inconsistent with s. 2.4(1.1)’s text and structure; (2) undermines the purpose of the Copyright Act; and (3) is not required by art. 8. I will then (4) offer my own interpretation of s. 2.4(1.1) and (5) explain why this interpretation allows Canada to fulfill its obligations under art. 8 through a combination of the performance, reproduction, and authorization rights in s. 3(1).

(1)         Text and Structure

[53]                          To understand the text of s. 2.4(1.1), one must understand the basic scheme of the Copyright Act.

[54]                        The opening paragraph of s. 3(1) of the Copyright Act exhaustively sets out three copyright interests that authors have in their works: the right to (1) produce or reproduce a work in any material form; (2) perform a work in public; or (3) publish an unpublished work. Section 3(1)(a) to (j) is “illustrative” of these three broad copyrights: ESA, at para. 42. For example, s. 3(1)(f), which gives authors the right to “communicate the work to the public by telecommunication”, illustrates an activity that falls within the broader right to perform a work in public. It is not a standalone or sui generis copyright in addition to the general rights described in s. 3(1): ESA, at paras. 25-27 and 42.

[55]                        The rights enumerated in s. 3(1) are distinct. A single activity can only engage one of the three copyright interests. When a song is downloaded, for example, only the author’s reproduction right is engaged. Similarly, when a work is streamed, only the author’s performance right is engaged: ESA, at para. 41. Authors are entitled to royalties for use of their works when an activity engages one of the copyright interests in s. 3(1).

[56]                        To determine which copyright interest is engaged by an activity, one must examine what that activity does to the copyrighted work. A performance is impermanent — “[w]hen it is over, only the memory remains”: Bishop v. Stevens, 1990 CanLII 75 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 467, at p. 479. Performances also allow authors to retain more control over their works than reproductions, as performed works can be withdrawn from the user after the performance is over. Accordingly, when an activity allows a user to experience a work for a limited period of time, the author’s performance right is engaged. A reproduction, by contrast, gives a user a durable copy of a work: Théberge v. Galerie d’Art du Petit Champlain inc., 2002 SCC 34, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 336, at paras. 42 and 47; ESA, at para. 35. Authors lose significantly more control over their works when they are reproduced. Once reproduced, authors cannot limit when, how, or the number of times a user experiences the work. Accordingly, activities that give users a durable copy of a work engage the author’s reproduction right.

[57]                        An activity that does not engage one of the three copyright interests in s. 3(1) or the author’s moral rights[3] is not a protected or compensable activity under the Copyright Act. In Théberge, for example, this Court held that authors could not prevent users from re-fixing their works on other canvasses because that activity did not engage the author’s reproduction, performance, or first publication rights. Even though altering the work in this manner was undoubtedly an “activity” in a physical sense, it was not a protected or compensable activity because there is no right of “fixation” in s. 3(1) of the Act.

[58]                        The Board’s interpretation of s. 2.4(1.1) is inconsistent with the text of s. 2.4(1.1) and the scheme of the Copyright Act. In ESA and Rogers, this Court explained that, since downloads and streams were single protected activities, authors could charge one royalty when users access works as downloads or streams — a reproduction royalty for downloads or a performance royalty for streams. The Board’s interpretation is entirely inconsistent with the holdings in ESA and Rogers. It would allow authors to charge two royalties for a single protected activity. If a work is downloaded, a user would pay (1) a performance royalty for making the work available and (2) a reproduction royalty for the download. If a work is streamed, a user would pay two performance royalties: (1) a performance royalty for making the work available and (2) another performance royalty for the stream.

[59]                        There is nothing in the text of s. 2.4(1.1) to indicate that this was Parliament’s intent. Section 2.4(1.1) is located in the “Interpretation” Division of the Act. It modifies the scope of an author’s performance right by modifying the definition of s. 3(1)(f). Since a download is a single protected activity that never engages s. 3(1)(f), I fail to see how modifying the definition of s. 3(1)(f) transforms downloads into two separately compensable activities. Similarly, I do not see how s. 2.4(1.1) transforms a single activity like streaming into two separately compensable performances. While I accept that the act of “making a work available” is a separate physical activity from the act of a user downloading or streaming a work, it does not follow that it is a separately compensable activity. Had Parliament intended to treat the act of making available as a new separately compensable activity, the way to do so would have been to add “making available” as a fourth copyright interest in the opening paragraph of s. 3(1), rather than as a modification to the scope of s. 3(1)(f).

[60]                        I do not accept SOCAN’s argument that this case is similar to CBC. In CBC, this Court found that the CBC had to pay separate reproduction royalties each time it made synchronization and broadcast incidental copies of a work. Two reproduction royalties were appropriate in that case because there were two protected activities in issue: (1) synchronization copying and (2) broadcast incidental copying. Since each activity created a separate durable copy of the work, each activity was protected and engaged the author’s reproduction interest: Théberge. But in this case, like in ESA and Rogers, there is only one protected activity in issue: either a download or a stream.

[61]                        For these reasons, I find no textual support for the Board’s interpretation of s. 2.4(1.1).

(2)         Purpose of the Copyright Act

[62]                        The Board’s interpretation of s. 2.4(1.1) also undermines the purpose of the Copyright Act because it violates the principle of technological neutrality.

[63]                        The principle of technological neutrality holds that, absent parliamentary intent to the contrary, the Copyright Act should not be interpreted in a way that either favours or discriminates against any form of technology: CBC, at para. 66. Distributing functionally equivalent works through old or new technology should engage the same copyright interests: Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada v. Bell Canada, 2012 SCC 36, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 326, at para. 43; CBC, at para. 72. For example, purchasing an album online should engage the same copyright interests, and attract the same quantum of royalties, as purchasing an album in a bricks-and-mortar store since these methods of purchasing the copyrighted works are functionally equivalent. What matters is what the user receives, not how the user receives: ESA, at paras. 5-6 and 9; Rogers, at para. 29. In its summary to the CMA, which precedes the preamble, Parliament signalled its support for technological neutrality, by stating that the amendments were intended to “ensure that [the Copyright Act] remains technologically neutral”.

[64]                        The Board’s interpretation of s. 2.4(1.1) violates the principle of technological neutrality because it requires that users pay additional royalties to access works online. To illustrate, consider a retailer that allows customers to purchase a digital or physical copy of an album. Regardless of whether the work is sold digitally or physically, the author’s reproduction interest in s. 3(1) is engaged because the user receives a durable copy of the work: ESA, at para. 31. The author is therefore entitled to a reproduction royalty. But under the Board’s interpretation of s. 2.4(1.1), purchasing the album online would entitle the author to an additional royalty — a performance royalty for making the work available for online purchase. Similarly, streaming the album online would require paying a “making available performance” royalty and a “streaming performance” royalty. But playing that same album on the radio would only require paying one performance royalty. Requiring that users pay additional royalties based solely on the mode of the work’s distribution violates the principle of technological neutrality.

[65]                        The appellants concede that the Board’s interpretation of s. 2.4(1.1) is not technologically neutral. They submit, however, that Parliament intended to derogate from the principle by passing s. 2.4(1.1). Because works can only be “made available” online — since there is no bricks-and-mortar way for the public to access a work at a time and place of their choosing — the appellants submit that Parliament must have intended to impose additional royalties on works distributed online.

[66]                        This is entirely unpersuasive. Clear legislative intent would be needed to derogate from the principle of technological neutrality given its central importance to the scheme of the Copyright Act. To appreciate why, it is necessary to situate the principle within the Act.

[67]                        Copyright law does not exist solely for the benefit of authors: York University v. Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency (Access Copyright), 2021 SCC 32, at paras. 90-91. Its overarching purpose is to balance users’ and authors’ rights. It does this by securing just rewards for authors while facilitating “public access to and dissemination of artistic and intellectual works, which enrich society and often provide users with the tools and inspiration to generate works of their own”: Access Copyright, at para. 92; see also Théberge, at paras. 30-31.

[68]                        The Copyright Act uses various tools to achieve this balance. Fair dealing, for example, promotes this balance by allowing “users to engage in some activities that might otherwise amount to copyright infringement”: Bell, at para. 11; see also Access Copyright, at para. 90. Similarly, the idea/expression dichotomy protects this balance by extending copyright protection to only original artistic expressions, not original ideas. This ensures that the public can freely use new ideas to inspire their own original works: CCH Canadian Ltd. v. Law Society of Upper Canada, 2004 SCC 13, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 339, at para. 8; A. Drassinower, “Copyright Is Not About Copying” (2012), 125 Harv. L. Rev. F. 108, at p. 111.

[69]                        Like fair dealing and the idea/expression dichotomy, the principle of technological neutrality is a tool for balancing users’ and authors’ rights. It ensures that authors retain the same rights over their works regardless of the technological means used to distribute those works. If the Copyright Act entitles authors to receive a certain royalty when their work is reproduced or performed offline, technological neutrality preserves an author’s right to receive that same royalty when their work is reproduced or performed online. As a corollary, it also protects users by preventing authors from extracting more royalties merely because their work is reproduced or performed online. As Professor Carys J. Craig explains in “Technological Neutrality: (Pre)Serving the Purposes of Copyright Law”, in M. Geist, ed., The Copyright Pentalogy: How the Supreme Court of Canada Shook the Foundations of Canadian Copyright Law (2013), 271,

     [t]his principled recognition of copyright as requiring a sensitive public policy balance, rather than simply the protection of a private property right, has had a marked impact on the landscape of Canadian copyright law. If copyright in general requires this balance, then it must surely follow that copyright in the digital era requires the preservation of this balance, which must mean that the law should have the same effect (produce a similar balance of rights and interests) whether applied offline or online. [Emphasis in original; p. 292.]

[70]                          With this context in mind, I am not persuaded that, in adopting s. 2.4(1.1), Parliament intended to derogate from the principle of technological neutrality. The principle of technological neutrality is designed to operate precisely in situations like the present case, where a novel technology emerges that has no clear traditional equivalent. In those circumstances, courts must look at what that new technology does to the substance of the work by examining which, if any, of the copyright interests in s. 3(1) are engaged by this new method of distributing a work. If that new technology gives users durable copies of a work, the author’s reproduction right is engaged. If the new technology gives users impermanent access to the work, the author’s performance right is engaged. What matters is what the user receives, not how the user receives it.

[71]                          With that said, copyright is a creature of statute. Parliament can therefore always choose to derogate from the principle of technological neutrality: Keatley Surveying Ltd. v. Teranet Inc., 2019 SCC 43, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 418, at para. 40. But derogating from this principle means significantly altering the balance between users’ and authors’ rights that has been foundational to the Copyright Act for decades: Keatley, at paras. 43-44. In this case, it would tilt the balance significantly in favour of authors. Users would face increased costs and be penalized for using certain new and improved technologies.

[72]                        Thus, courts should not conclude that Parliament intended to derogate from the principle of technological neutrality unless there is strong evidence that this was Parliament’s intent: see, for example, CBC, at paras. 50-51. That is not the case here. As discussed, the text of s. 2.4(1.1) and its placement in the Copyright Act does not support the view that Parliament wanted to make downloads and streams subject to two royalties. Further, as I will discuss next, giving effect to the WIPO Copyright Treaty does not demand this interpretation.

[73]                        Since there is no persuasive basis for concluding that Parliament intended to derogate from the principle of technological neutrality, s. 2.4(1.1) should be interpreted in a way that is technologically neutral: reproducing or performing a work online or offline should engage the same copyright interests and require the same royalties.

(3)         Section 2.4(1.1)’s Statutory Context: Article 8

[74]                        The Board did not err when it concluded that art. 8 requires that member countries give authors the right to control the act of making works available, in addition to any download or stream that might later occur. Authors should have recourse against individuals who upload their works online in a way that makes them available for downloading or streaming, even if the work is never actually downloaded or streamed.

[75]                        But I part company with the Board in its conclusion that this obligation requires imposing additional royalties on downloaded or streamed content. The WIPO Copyright Treaty does not demand that member countries create a new compensable “making available right” to satisfy art. 8. Member countries simply need to ensure that authors can control the physical act of making their works available. This control can be provided through any combination of rights. Accordingly, while I agree that the act of “making a work available” is a separate physical activity from a download or stream, I disagree with the view that the act of “making a work available” gives rise to distinct communications to the public (i.e., distinct performances). The making available of a stream and a stream are both protected as a single communication to the public, while the making available of a download is protected as an authorization to reproduce, and the download is protected as a reproduction.

[76]                        I expand on these points below, beginning with an examination of the goals of art. 8.

(a)           Article 8’s Goals

[77]                        Article 8 has two goals: (1) clarify that on-demand transmissions are captured by the right to communicate works to the public; and (2) ensure that authors can control the act of making their works available online. To understand these goals, it is necessary to understand the problem that art. 8 was designed to address.

[78]                        There is no “international copyright” law. However, many states have signed international treaties that require that they provide authors with certain protections in domestic copyright legislation. The 1886 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, 828 U.N.T.S. 221, for example, requires that member countries give authors an exclusive right to reproduce a work or perform a work in public. Canada’s Copyright Act, 1921, S.C. 1921, c. 24, was based on, and designed to implement, the Berne Convention: C. Foong, The Making Available Right: Realizing the Potential of Copyright’s Dissemination Function in the Digital Age (2019), at p. 54; L. Bently and B. Sherman, Intellectual Property Law (4th ed. 2014), at pp. 40-41; D. Vaver, Intellectual Property Law: Copyright, Patents, Trade-marks (2nd ed. 2011), at p. 55; ESA, at para. 13, citing Bishop, at pp. 473-74.

[79]                        The Berne Convention has been updated from time-to-time to respond to new technologies: L. E. Harris, Canadian Copyright Law (4th ed. 2014), at p. 59. In 1928, for example, the Berne Convention was updated to clarify that radio communications should be treated as an extension of the existing performance right: ESA, at para. 16.

[80]                        The Berne Convention needed to be updated again in response to on˗demand technologies. By the 1990s, it was clear the Berne Convention protected authors when their works were distributed through traditional “push” technologies like radio and cable broadcasts. But it was not clear whether it also protected authors when their works were distributed through newer “pull” technologies like on-demand transmissions. While it was possible to read the Berne Convention as applying to on-demand technologies, uncertainty existed: S. Ricketson and J. C. Ginsburg, International Copyright and Neighbouring Rights: The Berne Convention and Beyond (2nd ed. 2005 (reprinted 2010)), vol. I, at p. 742; Foong, at pp. 56-57; M. F. Makeen, “Video streaming and the communication to the public right in the United States and European Union”, in T. Aplin, ed., Research Handbook on Intellectual Property and Digital Technologies (2020), 246, at p. 253; Rogers, at para. 43.

[81]                        Article 8 resolved this ambiguity: Foong, at p. 60. It clarified that the right of “communication to the public” (an existing Berne Convention right) applied to on˗demand transmissions:

     The WCT’s principal innovation is its specification that the right of communication to the public includes a right of “making available. . .”. This right targets on-demand transmissions (whether by wire or wireless means), for it makes clear that the members of the public may be separated both in space and in time. . . . [I]t was possible to interpret the Berne Convention to cover at least wired on-demand transmissions of certain kinds of works, but it was not clear that the Berne Convention required member states to extend the communication to the public right to these transmissions. The WCT therefore supplies the missing mandate. . . . [Emphasis in original.]

      (Ricketson and Ginsburg, at p. 746; see also explanatory notes on art. 8 (then art. 10) in Diplomatic Conference on Certain Copyright and Neighboring Rights Questions, Basic Proposal for the Substantive Provisions of the Treaty on Certain Questions Concerning the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works to be Considered by the Diplomatic Conference, Doc. CRNR/DC/4, August 30, 1996, at notes 10.11 and 10.13.)

[82]                        Article 8’s first goal was therefore to clarify that the right to communicate works to the public (a performative activity) applied to on-demand technology. This was “neither a reaffirmation nor a novelty, for it resolves an ambiguity as to whether the old communication to the public rights accommodated or excluded ‘pull technologies’”: J. C. Ginsburg, “The (New?) Right of Making Available to the Public”, in Columbia Law School Public Law & Legal Theory Working Paper Group, Working Paper No. 04-78 (2004), at p. 12; see also J. Reinbothe and S. von Lewinski, The WIPO Treaties 1996: The WIPO Copyright Treaty and The WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty — Commentary and Legal Analysis (2002), at pp. 102 and 109; Makeen, at pp. 253-54; J. S. McKeown, Fox on Canadian Law of Copyright and Industrial Designs (4th ed. (loose-leaf)), at § 21:59.

[83]                        Article 8’s second goal was to ensure that authors could control when their works were made available online. The appellants, respondents, and their experts generally agree that art. 8 requires that member countries give authors the right to control the act of offering their works for downloading or streaming. The academic literature overwhelmingly supports this view: Reinbothe and von Lewinski, at p. 108; Bently and Sherman, at p. 45; United States Copyright Office, The Making Available Right in the United States: A Report of the Register of Copyrights (February 2016), at pp. 13-14; B. B. Sookman, Sookman: Computer, Internet and Electronic Commerce Law (loose-leaf), at § 3:90. As Cheryl Foong explains,

     [c]ertain characteristics of the making available right can be outlined. As the provision of mere accessibility is sufficient to infringe the right, it is not necessary to prove that an actual transmission has occurred. In this way, article 8 of the WCT lowered the communication right’s threshold of protection and enlarged its scope. [p. 79]

[84]                        Similarly, as Ricketson and Ginsburg wrote, “[i]t is not necessary that the offer be accepted: ‘making available’ embraces incipient as well as effected communications” (p. 747).

[85]                        This persuasively establishes that art. 8 requires that member countries give authors the right to control when and how their work is made available for downloading or streaming. This conclusion is in full accordance with the wording of art. 8, which entitles authors to control the act of making a work available in a way that the public “may access” it. Actual transmission is not required. It is also supported by the explanatory notes accompanying art. 8 (then art. 10), which explain that the relevant act protected by art. 8 is the “initial act” of providing “access” to the work:

      10.10 The second part of Article 10 explicitly states that communication to the public includes the making available to the public of works, by wire or wireless means, in such a way that members of the public may access these works from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. The relevant act is the making available of the work by providing access to it. What counts is the initial act of making the work available, not the mere provision of server space, communication connections, or facilities for the carriage and routing of signals. It is irrelevant whether copies are available for the user or whether the work is simply made perceptible to, and thus usable by, the user. [Emphasis added.]

[86]                        This conclusion is also consistent with the WIPO Copyright Treaty’s purpose: to fill potential gaps in the Berne Convention created by the emergence of new Internet technologies. There would be significant gaps in protection if copyright owners had no recourse against individuals who illicitly make works available online for downloading or streaming.

[87]                        But this conclusion does not require reading s. 2.4(1.1) as creating a new compensable “making available right”. Under the WIPO Copyright Treaty’s “umbrella solution”, member countries can protect the act of making a work available through various means. This is the issue to which I turn next.

(b)         The Umbrella Solution

[88]                        To recap, art. 8 obliges member countries to do two things: (1) protect on˗demand transmissions and (2) give authors the right to control when and how their work is made available for downloading or streaming. It does not, however, tell member countries how to give effect to these obligations. To accommodate different legal traditions and different drafting techniques among member countries, the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted an “umbrella solution”: each state could decide how to fulfill its art. 8 obligations. Member countries could provide for art. 8 protections through “an explicit making available right or provide effective coverage of the right through a combination of pre˗existing rights”: Foong, at pp. 62-63; see also Makeen, at p. 254; R. Keller, “Moving Toward a Balanced ‘Making Available Right’ in Canada” (2014), 27 I.P.J. 213, at pp. 221-22. As the explanatory text accompanying art. 8 (then art. 10) emphasizes:

      10.21 It is strongly emphasized that Article 10 does not attempt to define the nature or extent of liability on a national level. This proposed international agreement determines only the scope of the exclusive rights that shall be granted to authors in respect of their works. Who is liable for the violation of these rights and what the extent of liability shall be for such violations is a matter for national legislation and case law according to the legal traditions of each Contracting Party.

[89]                        In accordance with the umbrella solution, member countries have protected the act of making works available through a variety of means. Some have adopted wording similar to that in art. 8. Others have made no statutory changes, relying instead on existing rights to give effect to the obligations under art. 8. The United States, for example, has relied on its existing reproduction, performance, and distribution rights to give effect to its art. 8 obligations: United States Copyright Office, at pp. 74-77; Foong, at p. 84; Makeen, at pp. 256-57.

[90]                        In sum, the umbrella solution gave “relative freedom [to] national legislators in choosing the right of distribution, the right of communication to the public, the combination of these rights, or a new right, to fulfil obligations under Article 8”: M. Ficsor, The Law of Copyright and the Internet: The 1996 WIPO Treaties, their Interpretation and Implementation (2002), at p. 501. Accordingly, provided that the Copyright Act gives effect to art. 8’s goals through any combination of rights, Canada will be in compliance with its obligations under art. 8.

(4)         What Is the Correct Interpretation of Section 2.4(1.1)?

[91]                        With the art. 8 context in mind, the reading that is most consistent with the text, structure, purpose, and context of s. 2.4(1.1) is as follows: s. 2.4(1.1) clarifies that (1) s. 3(1)(f) applies to on-demand streams, and (2) a work is performed as soon as it is made available for on-demand streaming. This interpretation gives effect to Canada’s obligations under art. 8 through a combination of the performance, reproduction, and authorization rights in s. 3(1). In so doing, it also respects the principle of technological neutrality as it ensures that authors retain the same rights and royalties over their works regardless of whether the works are distributed online or offline.

[92]                        First, s. 2.4(1.1) clarifies that the communication right in s. 3(1)(f) applies to on-demand streams. When the CMA received royal assent, it was not clear whether s. 3(1)(f) applied to “pull” technologies like on-demand streams. In Rogers, for example, a group of music service providers argued that s. 3(1)(f) did not apply to newer “pull” technologies like on-demand streams. Section 2.4(1.1) ends this debate by clarifying that s. 3(1)(f) applies to on-demand technology, since on-demand technology “allows a member of the public to have access to [a work] from a place and at a time individually chosen by that member of the public”.

[93]                        The significance of s. 2.4(1.1) was blunted by Rogers, which interpreted s. 3(1)(f) as applying to on-demand streaming before s. 2.4(1.1) came into force. However, the CMA received royal assent before Rogers was released. Just as art. 8 did for the Berne Convention, s. 2.4(1.1) was intended to resolve an ambiguity and clarify that s. 3(1)(f) applies to on-demand streams. Had Rogers not been decided at the time or had it been decided differently, s. 2.4(1.1) would have significantly clarified the law: see J. de Beer, “Copyright Royalty Stacking”, in M. Geist, ed., The Copyright Pentalogy: How the Supreme Court of Canada Shook the Foundations of Canadian Copyright Law (2013), 335, at p. 363.

[94]                        I also note that s. 2.4(1.1) provides slightly broader protection to authors than Rogers provides. Section 2.4(1.1)’s language makes clear that a single on-demand stream to a member of the public is a “communication to the public” under s. 3(1)(f). By contrast, the ratio in Rogers held that on-demand streams could be communications to the public if there was a “series of point-to-point communications of the same work to an aggregation of individuals”: para. 52 (emphasis added). Under s. 2.4(1.1) there is no need to prove a “series” of point-to-point communications. A single point-to-point on-demand communication to a member of the public will engage s. 3(1)(f).

[95]                        Second, s. 2.4(1.1) clarifies that a work is performed as soon as it is made available for on-demand streaming. This interpretation is supported by the text of s. 2.4(1.1), its context, and the broader purpose of the Copyright Act.

[96]                        Textually, s. 2.4(1.1) says that a work is communicated when the work is made available in a way that “allows” a member of the public to access a work from a place and time of their choosing. It does not say that the work needs to be accessed for it to be communicated.

[97]                        Contextually, art. 8 supports this reading of s. 2.4(1.1). As discussed, art. 8 requires that member countries give authors the right to control the act of making works available, in addition to any resulting download or stream. One way to do so is to clarify that a work is performed as soon as it is made available for on-demand streaming.

[98]                        Finally, this interpretation is consistent with the purpose of the Copyright Act as it promotes technological neutrality. Historically, a work was performed as soon as the public was given the opportunity to experience the work for a limited period of time. For example, when a work is transmitted over cable television, the work is performed, regardless of how many customers tune in to the channel. “[T]here need not be an audience listening to the performance, as long as the performance is meant for an audience”: Harris, at p. 141. As Ricketson and Ginsburg explain,

     [i]f only one person initiates the on-demand transmission at a time (or ever) is there a “communication to the public” within the meaning of the Berne Convention? The number of recipients should not in fact matter; what should count is the availability of the communication to “the public”. For example, there is a “communication to the public by wire” of a cinematographic work (article 14bis(1)) if a film is transmitted on cable television, even if no viewer in fact selects that channel to watch. What makes the communication “to the public” is the invitation to any member of the public to turn on the television and view the programme. Even when the cable transmission is restricted, for example, to paying subscribers, it still is “to the public” because any member of the public is invited to pay the fee. [Emphasis added; pp. 742-43.]

[99]                        Section 2.4(1.1) ensures that on-demand streams receive similar treatment. Section 2.4(1.1) makes it clear that a work is performed as soon as it is made available to the public for on-demand streaming because, at that point, users are given the opportunity to temporarily experience the work. Once a work is made available for on-demand streaming, all users have to do is tune in to the stream to experience the work. This is the digital equivalent of flipping to a 24/7 television channel that is continuously playing — that is performing — a particular work.

[100]                     This interpretation does not require treating the act of making the work available as a separate performance from the work’s subsequent transmission as a stream. The work is performed as soon as it is made available for on-demand streaming. At this point, a royalty is payable. If a user later experiences this performance by streaming the work, they are experiencing an already ongoing performance, not starting a new one. No separate royalty is payable at that point. The “act of ‘communication to the public’ in the form of ‘making available’ is completed by merely making a work available for on˗demand transmission. If then the work is actually transmitted in that way, it does not mean that two acts are carried out: ‘making available’ and ‘communication to the public’. The entire act thus carried out will be regarded as communication to the public”: Ficsor, at p. 508. In other words, the making available of a stream and a stream by a user are both protected as a single performance — a single communication to the public.

(5)         Does the Copyright Act Accord With Article 8?

[101]                     With this interpretation in mind, I conclude that the Copyright Act gives effect to Canada’s obligations under art. 8 through a combination of the performance, reproduction, and authorization rights in s. 3(1).

[102]                     If works are streamed or made available for streaming, the author’s performance right as illustrated by s. 3(1)(f) is engaged. A user cannot stream a work or make a work available for on-demand streaming without engaging the author’s performance right in s. 3(1).

[103]                     However, since downloads do not engage s. 3(1)(f) or the author’s performance rights, the Copyright Act protects downloads through a different set of rights: the reproduction and authorization rights. If a work is downloaded, the author’s reproduction right is engaged; if the work is made available for downloading, the author’s right to authorize reproductions is engaged. To understand this point, it is necessary to understand the right to authorize reproductions or performances of a work in s. 3(1).

[104]                     “It is an infringement of copyright for any person to do, without the consent of the copyright owner, anything that by this Act only the owner of the copyright has the right to do”: s. 27(1). This includes the right to “authorize” a reproduction or performance: s. 3(1). To “authorize” means to sanction, approve and countenance: CCH, at para. 38, citing Muzak Corp. v. Composers, Authors and Publishers Association of Canada, Ltd., 1953 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1953] 2 S.C.R. 182, at p.193. Whether a reproduction or performance has been authorized is a question of fact and can be “inferred from acts that are less than direct and positive, including a sufficient degree of indifference”: CCH, at para. 38.

[105]                     Authorization is a distinct right granted to copyright owners. A user who unlawfully authorizes a reproduction or a performance of a work may be held liable for infringement of that right, regardless of whether the work is ultimately reproduced or performed: CCH Canadian Ltd. v. Law Society of Upper Canada, 2002 FCA 187, [2002] 4 F.C. 213, at paras. 112-13; Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada v. Canadian Assn. of Internet Providers, 2004 SCC 45, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 427, at para. 120; B. Sookman, S. Mason and C. Craig, Copyright: Cases and Commentary on the Canadian and International Law (2nd ed. 2013), at p. 1001.

[106]                     If an individual makes a work available for downloading, that person implicitly authorizes the work’s reproduction: Apple Computer, Inc. v. Mackintosh Computers Ltd., 1987 CanLII 9003 (FCA), [1988] 1 F.C. 673 (C.A.), at p. 697, aff’d 1990 CanLII 119 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 209. As the Copyright Board recognized in SOCAN Statement of Royalties, Public Performance of Musical Works 1996, 1997, 1998 (Tariff 22, Internet) (Re) (1999), 1 C.P.R. (4th) 417,

     “[a]uthorization” constitutes a separate protected use under the Act. To authorize is to sanction, approve and countenance. The person who makes a musical work available on an Internet-accessible site authorizes its communication. The work is posted for the sole purpose of being communicated and with full knowledge and intention that such a communication would occur. The person who makes the work available does more than merely provide the means to communicate the work; he/she either controls or purports to control the right to communicate it.

      . . .

     Moreover, it is the act of posting that constitutes authorization. By doing so, a person invites anyone with Internet access to have the work communicated to them. [Footnotes omitted; pp. 455-57.]

      See also Warman v. Fournier, 2012 FC 803, 104 C.P.R. (4th) 21, at para. 13.

[107]                     While the above passage refers to communications, the Board’s comments are similarly applicable to reproductions. If a person makes a work available for downloading without authorization, that person infringes the copyright owner’s right to authorize reproductions. That is so regardless of whether the works are ultimately downloaded.

[108]                     Together, the performance, reproduction, and authorization rights in s. 3(1) of the Copyright Act give effect to Canada’s obligations under art. 8 and they do so in a technologically neutral manner. If a work is streamed or made available for on˗demand streaming, the author’s performance right is engaged. If a work is downloaded, the author’s reproduction right is engaged. If a work is made available for downloading, the author’s right to authorize reproductions is engaged. There are no gaps in protection.

[109]                     I would add that there is nothing novel about relying on a combination of rights to give effect to the obligations under art. 8. As noted above, the United States also relies on a combination of rights to satisfy art. 8’s requirements. As the United States Copyright Office explained, when examining the United States’ compliance with the WIPO Copyright Treaty,

     [t]he Office maintains its longstanding view that the act of making a copyrighted work available in such a way that members of the public may access it at a time and place of their choosing will implicate one or more of the exclusive rights under Section 106 of the U.S. Copyright Act. In general, where a party offers members of the public access to a work in the form of a download, the offer implicates the right of distribution. Where access is offered in the form of a stream or the showing of an image, the relevant right is that of public performance or public display. In each case, the applicable statutory provision satisfies the essential elements of the treaty obligation, including specifically the requirements that the exclusive right cover (1) offers to communicate a work, not just completed transmissions, and (2) individualized communications that can be received in separate places and at different times. [p. 74]

D.           Summary

[110]                     To recap, I do not agree with the Board’s interpretation of s. 2.4(1.1). The reading most consistent with the text, structure, purpose and context of s. 2.4(1.1) is as follows: s. 2.4(1.1) clarifies that (1) s. 3(1)(f) applies to on-demand streams, and (2) a work is performed as soon as it is made available for on-demand streaming.

[111]                     This interpretation of s. 2.4(1.1) gives effect to Canada’s obligations under art. 8. There is no way to download a work, stream a work, or make a work available for on-demand streaming or downloading that does not engage one of the author’s exclusive rights in s. 3(1).

[112]                     This interpretation is also technologically neutral. Similar to offline distributions, downloading or streaming works will continue to engage only one copyright interest and require paying one royalty — a reproduction royalty for downloads or a performance royalty for streams. If a work is downloaded or made available for downloading, s. 3(1)(f) is not engaged. Is a work if made available for streaming and later streamed, s. 3(1)(f) is only engaged once.

[113]                     Before concluding, I would note that the value of these rights is not in issue in this appeal. Setting the appropriate royalties to compensate authors when these rights are engaged is a matter for the Board to decide. Similarly, the considerations that a court might have regard to in assessing monetary remedies for infringement is a matter to be decided if and when such a case arises.

VII.      Conclusion

[114]                     For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal. Apple Inc. and Apple Canada Inc. are awarded their costs in this Court; the remaining respondents are awarded their costs in this Court and in the Federal Court of Appeal.

 

The reasons of Karakatsanis and Martin JJ. were delivered by

 

                    Karakatsanis J. —

[115]                     In Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, this Court sought to bring coherence and predictability to the law governing judicial review. The majority “set out a holistic revision of the framework” anchored in a strong presumption of reasonableness, which could only be rebutted in five situations (para. 143).

[116]                     This case does not fall within any of those categories. Nevertheless, my colleague concludes the standard of review is correctness. Even though the majority in Vavilov did not choose to recognize concurrent first instance jurisdiction between courts and administrative bodies as an exception to the presumption of reasonableness, my colleague does so, creating a sixth category of correctness review. I cannot agree.

[117]                     By creating a new correctness category only three years after a majority of the Court set out a comprehensive framework, my colleague’s conclusion undermines Vavilov’s promise of certainty and predictability. His approach shows no fidelity to the majority’s reasons in Vavilov, which were “the product of careful consideration undertaken following extensive submissions and based on a thorough review of the relevant jurisprudence” (para. 69). This thorough review obviously considered correctness cases of recent vintage, such as Rogers Communications Inc. v. Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada, 2012 SCC 35, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 283. Indeed, the majority cited Rogers at para. 48.

[118]                     In my view, a faithful application of the Vavilov framework can only result in one conclusion — the standard of review in this case is reasonableness. Even so, the Copyright Board of Canada’s decision cannot be upheld. The reasons are unreasonable in light of the statutory context and this Court’s precedents.

[119]                     My reasons proceed in three parts. First, I address the applicable standard of review in light of Vavilov. Second, I discuss the appropriate approach to a reasonableness review. Finally, I turn to the Board’s reasons in this case (2017 CanLII 152886).

I.               The Standard of Review is Reasonableness

[120]                     In the decade following the Court’s decision in Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, the standard of review proved contentious. Vavilov promised to bring the parties’ focus back to the substantive merits of their case rather than the governing test (para. 69, quoting Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v. Alberta Teachers’ Association, 2011 SCC 61, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 654, at para. 36, which quoted Dunsmuir, at para. 145, per Binnie J., concurring).

[121]                     In granting leave in Vavilov, the Court “viewed these appeals as an opportunity to consider the law applicable to the judicial review of administrative decisions as addressed in Dunsmuir and subsequent cases” (para. 6 (emphasis added)). The Court “appointed two amici curiae, invited the parties to devote a substantial portion of their submissions to the standard of review issue, and granted leave to 27 interveners, comprising 4 attorneys general and numerous organizations representing the breadth of the Canadian administrative law landscape” (Vavilov, at para. 6).

[122]                     In addition to hearing from a broad range of parties, the Court undertook an exhaustive review of its jurisprudence, including recent correctness cases: Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada v. Canadian Assn. of Internet Providers, 2004 SCC 45, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 427, at paras. 48-50; Rogers, at paras. 10-20; Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. SODRAC 2003 Inc., 2015 SCC 57, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 615 (CBC), at para. 35. The majority’s decision was “the product of careful consideration undertaken following extensive submissions and based on a thorough review of the relevant jurisprudence” (Vavilov, at para. 69 (emphasis added)).

[123]                     With the assistance of submissions and our existing jurisprudence, the majority set out a new “holistic” framework. Vavilov was explicit about what it accomplished: a presumption of reasonableness in judicial review that could only be displaced in five situations. Those situations are: (i) where the legislature explicitly prescribes the applicable standard of review; (ii) where the legislature has provided a statutory appeal mechanism; (iii) constitutional questions; (iv) general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole; and (v) questions related to the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies (Vavilov, at paras. 17 and 69). The Court made clear “that these reasons address all of the situations in which a reviewing court should derogate from the presumption of reasonableness review” (Vavilov, at para. 69 (emphasis added)).

[124]                     Concurrent jurisdiction at first instance was not among these five exceptional categories. Although the Court did not “definitively foreclose the possibility that another category could be recognized”, noting that “it would be unrealistic to declare that we have contemplated every possible set of circumstances [that would] require a derogation from the presumption of reasonableness”, this was clearly not so with concurrent first instance jurisdiction between the Copyright Board and courts (para. 70). I repeat the obvious: The Court had its own recent precedent in Rogers before it — a decision that is cited in Vavilov. The establishment of new categories was explicitly reserved for possible circumstances the Court could not realistically foresee. It is “unrealistic” to suggest that the Court’s own precedent represents a “possible set of circumstances” that it could not “have contemplated”.

[125]                     Instead, the Court chose not to make first instance concurrent jurisdiction an exception. In so doing, it overturned Rogers on the standard of review issue. This was not an oversight. Nor was it inadvertent. The majority acknowledged that the judgment “depart[ed] from the Court’s existing jurisprudence on standard of review in certain respects” (Vavilov, at para. 18).

[126]                     Finally, even if Rogers had not been within the contemplation of the Court, it would not qualify as an additional exceptional correctness category: “any new basis for correctness review would be exceptional and would need to be consistent with the framework and the overarching principles set out in these reasons” (Vavilov, at para. 70).

[127]                     I reject the suggestion that this is such a rare and exceptional circumstance. A new category of concurrent jurisdiction at first instance cannot be justified on the basis of the rule of law or legislative intent. These considerations did not justify the creation of this category in Vavilov. They do not justify creating this category now.

[128]                     First, I agree with the majority in Vavilov that “the more robust form of reasonableness review . . ., which accounts for the value of consistency and the threat of arbitrariness, is capable, in tandem with internal administrative processes to promote consistency and with legislative oversight . . ., of guarding against threats to the rule of law” (para. 72 (citation omitted)). With courts also acting as first instance decision makers, a robust form of reasonableness is even more equipped to safeguard the rule of law. Specifically, a binding and material precedent will place a limit on what is reasonable in the circumstances (Vavilov, at paras. 111-12, per the majority, and para. 293, per Abella and Karakatsanis JJ., dissenting, but not on this point).

[129]                     Administrative decision makers also play an important role in upholding and applying the rule of law. In any event, consistency in decision making and the rule of law cannot be absolute in nature regardless of the context (Domtar Inc. v. Quebec (Commission d’appel en matière de lésions professionnelles), 1993 CanLII 106 (SCC), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 756, at pp. 787-88).

[130]                     In my view, recognizing a sixth category on the basis of the rule of law flouts stare decisis principles and therefore runs directly counter to the rule of law. Ultimately, a faithful application of the majority’s framework in Vavilov cannot credibly justify the creation of a sixth correctness category on this basis.

[131]                     Second, the Copyright Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-42, gives no clear signal of legislative intent regarding the applicable standard of review. Vavilov states that the legislature can provide this signal in two ways: it can explicitly prescribe the standard, or it can provide a statutory appeal mechanism (para. 33). Concurrent jurisdiction between a tribunal and a court was before the Court in Vavilov but was not identified as an analogous signal of legislative intent requiring correctness review. Here, there is no legislated standard of review, statutory appeal mechanism, nor any other analogous provisions. Legislative choice “pulls in two directions” — the absence of these “clear signals” is telling (Vavilov, at paras. 39 and 49). It follows that a sixth category cannot be established on the basis of Parliament’s intent.

[132]                     Consequently, neither legislative intent nor the rule of law can bring this case into the realm of the “rare and exceptional” — to conclude otherwise sweeps aside the Court’s recently established framework governing the standard of review. Rather, the creation of a sixth category is simply contrary to the majority reasons in Vavilov. This Court’s “guidance . . . should be treated as binding” when it “turns its full attention to an issue and deals with it definitively” (M. Rowe and L. Katz, “A Practical Guide to Stare Decisis” (2020), 41 Windsor Rev. Legal Soc. Issues 1, at p. 10).

[133]                     Although my colleague relies on para. 70 to steer off the clear pathway set by Vavilov, it must be read in the context of the preceding paragraph. Paragraph 69 speaks for itself:

In these reasons, we have identified five situations in which a derogation from the presumption of reasonableness review is warranted either on the basis of legislative intent (i.e., legislated standards of review and statutory appeal mechanisms) or because correctness review is required by the rule of law (i.e., constitutional questions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole, and questions regarding jurisdictional boundaries between administrative bodies). This framework is the product of careful consideration undertaken following extensive submissions and based on a thorough review of the relevant jurisprudence. We are of the view, at this time, that these reasons address all of the situations in which a reviewing court should derogate from the presumption of reasonableness review. As previously indicated, courts should no longer engage in a contextual inquiry to determine the standard of review or to rebut the presumption of reasonableness review. Letting go of this contextual approach will, we hope, “get the parties away from arguing about the tests and back to arguing about the substantive merits of their case”: Alberta Teachers, at para. 36, quoting Dunsmuir, at para. 145, per Binnie J., concurring.

[134]                     For all these reasons, I conclude that the majority decision in Vavilov compels review of the Board’s decision under a reasonableness standard.

[135]                     Given the majority’s departure from Vavilov, I would sound a note of caution. Questioning the continued authority of correctness cases that predate Vavilov undermines the Court’s framework and its goal of promoting consistency, coherence, and certainty in the law of judicial review. Regrettably, my colleague’s approach will not be without consequences. Not only will it open the door to endless litigation concerning possible exceptions to the reasonableness presumption, it will erode the presumption of reasonableness in all standard of review cases going forward. This result is precisely what Vavilov aimed to avoid.

II.            Reasonableness Review

[136]                     Before turning to the Board’s reasons in this case, I address the approach to reasonableness review. First, three clarifying comments.

[137]                     In Vavilov, the Court was clear: there is only one standard of reasonableness. The Court expressly rejected the idea that context could modify the standard or degree of scrutiny by the reviewing court. While context does not affect the standard of review, it is obviously important in determining whether the decision itself is reasonable (Vavilov, at para. 67; Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Khosa, 2009 SCC 12, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 339, at para. 59). To the extent that the reasons of the Federal Court of Appeal imply otherwise, they are incorrect (2020 FCA 100, [2021] 1 F.C.R. 374).

[138]                     Second, I would also note that, in conducting a reasonableness review, it is not helpful to review the factors set out by the court below in paras. 26-36 of their reasons. Vavilov was designed to provide a clear, coherent and comprehensive framework, so additional considerations are unnecessary and undermine the Court’s goal of bringing clarity to the standard of review.

[139]                     Finally, it is misleading to characterize the Court’s recent jurisprudence as a return to textualism, as the Federal Court of Appeal did, at para. 42. As the Court confirmed in Vavilov, courts and administrative decision makers alike interpret a statutory provision “by applying the ‘modern principle’ of statutory interpretation, that is, that the words of a statute must be read ‘in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament’” (Vavilov, at para. 117, citing Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), 1998 CanLII 837 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, and Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 26, both quoting E. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87).

[140]                     Context and consequences remain essential (see, e.g., Uber Technologies Inc. v. Heller, 2020 SCC 16). A purely textual reading is inconsistent with a broad and remedial approach to statutory interpretation. And, as Abella J. and I have noted elsewhere, “words matter, policy objectives matter, and consequences matter” (TELUS Communications Inc. v. Wellman, 2019 SCC 19, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 144, at para. 108).

[141]                     With those clarifications in mind, the framework for reasonableness review can be plainly stated as follows.

[142]                     A reasonable decision is “one that is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis” that operates within the bounds set by the context (Vavilov, at para. 85; see also paras. 293 and 296, per Abella and Karakatsanis JJ., dissenting, but not on this point). The reviewing court asks “whether the decision bears the hallmarks of reasonableness — justification, transparency and intelligibility” (Vavilov, at para. 99). This approach requires the reviewing court to start with how the decision maker arrived at their interpretation and to determine whether that interpretation was defensible in light of the facts and the law (Vavilov, at para. 86, per the majority, and para. 205, per Abella and Karakatsanis JJ., both quoting Dunsmuir, at para. 47).

[143]                     Statutory interpretation questions may be evaluated on a reasonableness standard (Vavilov, at para. 115). Where this standard applies, “the reviewing court does not undertake a de novo analysis of the question or ‘ask itself what the correct decision would have been’” (Vavilov, at para. 116, quoting Law Society of New Brunswick v. Ryan, 2003 SCC 20, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 247, at para. 50). Rather, “the court must examine the administrative decision as a whole, including the reasons provided by the decision maker and the outcome that was reached” (Vavilov, at para. 116).

[144]                     The court does so, as explained above, in reference to the modern principle of statutory interpretation. Although administrative decision makers need not engage in a formalistic interpretation, their task is to interpret the contested provision in a manner that is consistent with the text, context and purpose, applying their particular insight into the statutory scheme at issue (Vavilov, at paras. 120-21).

[145]                     At all times, a reasonableness review proceeds from a posture of deference. It finds its starting point in judicial restraint and respects the distinct role of administrative decision makers (Vavilov, at para. 75). It follows that a decision must be afforded a fair and generous construction.

[146]                     The party challenging the decision must satisfy the court “that any shortcomings or flaws relied on . . . are sufficiently central or significant to render the decision unreasonable” (Vavilov, at para. 100). In this case, that burden lies with the respondents.

III.         Applying the Standard of Review in This Case

[147]                     I turn now to the application of the reasonableness standard in this case.

[148]                     As I will explain, the Board’s decision is unreasonable because it disregards two significant considerations: (i) a recent precedent from the Court, and (ii) the guiding principles of the statutory scheme. Although administrative decision makers need not “explicitly address all possible shades of meaning”, the Board did not consider key elements that supported a contrary interpretation of the relevant statutory provision (Vavilov, at para. 122, quoting Construction Labour Relations v. Driver Iron Inc., 2012 SCC 65, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 405, at para. 3).

[149]                     First, the Board’s decision is unreasonable because it interpreted s. 2.4(1.1) without meaningful consideration of the legal context, as required by Vavilov, at para. 112. Specifically, the Board determined, at para. 136, that Entertainment Software Association v. Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada, 2012 SCC 34, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 231 (ESA) — a relevant and binding precedent from this Court — was distinguishable and therefore not binding. As a result, the Board considered it irrelevant to an interpretation of s. 2.4(1.1).

[150]                     In my view, it was unreasonable for the Board to disregard ESA — the leading domestic authority on s. 3(1)(f). It did so for three reasons. The Board first dismissed the applicability of ESA because it was decided without reference to the WIPO Copyright Treaty, Can. T.S. 2014 No. 20, or the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty, Can. T.S. 2014 No. 21. Although I agree that the Treaties form part of the relevant legal context, this was not a cogent basis to disregard or distinguish ESA’s interpretation of the Copyright Act, especially because domestic law always prevails (National Corn Growers Assn. v. Canada (Import Tribunal), 1990 CanLII 49 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1324, at pp. 1371-72).

[151]                     The Board next pointed out that ESA was decided against a different legislative backdrop. Yet, three critical aspects of the legislation remained the same with the enactment of the Copyright Modernization Act, S.C. 2012, c. 20 (CMA): (i) the language of s. 3(1)(f), (ii) the Copyright Act’s fundamental distinction between performance and reproduction rights, and (iii) Parliament’s commitment to preserve technological neutrality. All these aspects were critical to the Court’s reasoning in ESA and have implications for the reasonable interpretations available to the Board. It was unreasonable for the Board to disregard the similarities in context.

[152]                     Finally, the Board noted that the “previous interpretation of ‘communicate’ in ESA focussed only on the transmission element of that right and is distinguishable” (para. 117). While ESA considered the definition of “communication” in a more narrow sense because it only focussed on part of the activity in question (i.e., downloads), summarily dispensing with its guidance was inappropriate. The act of making available is inextricably bound with any subsequent transmission — someone cannot stream or download a work without it first being made available. A consideration of this whole transaction is necessary because otherwise the Board could not assess the entirety of rights engaged. The result, as is evident, is an interpretation that would create two rights for a single activity, which fails to strike a proper balance between user and creator rights.

[153]                     Had the Board meaningfully engaged with ESA, it would not have rendered a decision that captured downloads — a reproductive activity — within an act of communication, contrary to ESA, at para. 39, nor would it have effectively created two separate rights for a single activity, contrary to ESA, at para. 41. Without a cogent reason to distinguish ESA, the Board unreasonably neglected the Court’s interpretation of s. 3(1)(f) and reached a conclusion that is inconsistent with a material legal precedent of the Court.

[154]                     The Board’s decision was also unreasonable in the context of the broader statutory scheme.

[155]                     First, as the Court has recognized, the Act aims to strike a balance between the interests of user and creator, and the proper balance “lies not only in recognizing the creator’s rights but in giving due weight to their limited nature” (Théberge v. Galerie d’Art du Petit Champlain inc., 2002 SCC 34, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 336, at para. 31). With the benefit of duplicate royalties, the equilibrium now swings heavily in the creator’s favour, contrary to this Court’s instructions to maintain balance in CBC, at para. 63, and ESA, at paras. 9 and 11. The Board’s reasons fail to meaningfully address the duplicate royalties that would arise when a work is subsequently downloaded or streamed. This was unreasonable in light of the Court’s caution against this precise kind of layering of rights, or “double-dipping” of tariffs (ESA, at para. 11). This aspect of the Board’s decision was not reasonable.

[156]                     Second, the Board’s reasons with respect to technological neutrality — a guiding interpretive principle for the Act — were unreasonable. At para. 128, the Board recognized that the CMA expressed Parliament’s goal to ensure the Act remains technologically neutral. It also acknowledged that the principle of technological neutrality applies unless there is evidence of Parliamentary intent to the contrary (para. 127). Yet, the interpretation advanced by the Board was not technologically neutral because, contrary to the importance placed on technological neutrality by this Court in ESA, at para. 2, and CBC, at para. 66, it opened the door to duplicate royalties simply because the transaction takes place online.

[157]                     The Board’s sole basis for concluding that the principle of technological neutrality does not limit or restrict the meaning of s. 2.4(1.1) was confined to one sentence highlighting “the legislative history, the rationale for the WIPO Internet Treaties, and the legislative objective to fully implement those treaties using a ‘coordinated approach’” (para. 129). The Board did not explain how this can displace Parliament’s express intention to enact the CMA in a technologically neutral way. Without displacing Parliament’s intent, the Board could not endorse an interpretation that applied differently to diverse forms of media. The Board’s decision in this respect was unreasonable.

[158]                     In summary, the failure of the Board to consider the Court’s material and binding precedents or the animating themes of the Copyright Act was unreasonable. While a failure to consider “a pertinent aspect of [a provision’s] text, context or purpose” will not always be fatal under a reasonableness review, this is not a case where the omission is a minor aspect of the interpretive context (Vavilov, at para. 122). As a result, I do not accept the Board’s interpretation of s. 2.4(1.1).

[159]                     Unless there is only one reasonable outcome, as a general rule, a court applying the reasonableness standard refrains from deciding the issue (Vavilov, at paras. 83 and 110). Accordingly, a reviewing court “does not ask what decision it would have made in place of that of the administrative decision maker, attempt to ascertain the ‘range’ of possible conclusions that would have been open to the decision maker, conduct a de novo analysis or seek to determine the ‘correct’ solution to the problem” (Vavilov, at para. 83).

[160]                     If correctness was the applicable standard, then I would agree with my colleague’s conclusion that s. 2.4(1.1) could not be read as creating a new independent right that is triggered when works are made available for downloading or on-demand streaming, nor as creating a separate tariff. Nothing in the text, context, or purpose of s. 2.4(1.1) suggests otherwise, particularly when viewed in light of the legal landscape in which it operates.

IV.         Disposition

[161]                     I would dismiss the appeal. Remitting the matter for a new interpretation is unnecessary because it would not change the result on the merits: the Board already found that it did not have sufficient evidence to determine what tariff should apply to the making available activity.

 

                    Appeal dismissed.

                  Jamal J. —

I.               Overview

[1]                             Section 231(5) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, provides that murder is first degree murder, irrespective of whether the murder is planned and deliberate, when the victim’s death is caused “while committing or attempting to commit” any of several listed crimes of domination, including hijacking an aircraft, any form of sexual assault, kidnapping, hostage taking, or unlawful confinement. At issue in this appeal is whether the appellant, Darren Sundman, murdered Jordan McLeod “while committing” the offence of unlawful confinement.

[2]                             The appellant and Mr. McLeod were drug dealers with a mutual animosity. On the day of Mr. McLeod’s murder, the appellant unlawfully confined him in a moving pickup truck and repeatedly assaulted him by hitting him with a handgun. Mr. McLeod jumped from the truck when it slowed to make a turn but was then chased on foot by the appellant and two accomplices. When Mr. McLeod ran for his life, the appellant shot him at least three times but did not manage to kill him. As he lay wounded, Mr. McLeod was shot and killed at close range by one of the accomplices.

[3]                             The appellant was acquitted of first degree murder but convicted of second degree murder. The trial judge accepted that although Mr. McLeod was unlawfully confined in the truck, he had managed to escape his confinement by jumping from the truck. The trial judge held that the appellant murdered Mr. McLeod but ruled that because of the brief gap in time between when Mr. McLeod was confined in the truck and when he was killed, the appellant did not murder him “while committing” the offence of unlawful confinement. The murder was thus in the second degree.

[4]                             The Court of Appeal for British Columbia unanimously allowed the Crown’s appeal and substituted a conviction for first degree murder under s. 231(5)(e) of the Criminal Code. The court held that Mr. McLeod was still unlawfully confined when he jumped from the truck and was chased before being killed. The unlawful confinement and the murder were temporally and causally connected, making the entire series of events a single transaction. The appellant now appeals to this Court as of right.

[5]                             I would dismiss the appeal. In my view, Mr. McLeod was still unlawfully confined when he escaped from the truck and ran for his life. Even though Mr. McLeod was not physically restrained outside the truck, he continued to be coercively restrained through violence, fear, and intimidation. He was deprived of his liberty and was not free to move about according to his inclination and desire. The appellant then murdered him while unlawfully confining him. These two distinct criminal acts were part of a continuous sequence of events forming a single transaction. They were close in time and involved an ongoing domination of Mr. McLeod that began in the truck, continued when he escaped from the truck and ran for his life, and ended with his murder. The appellant is therefore guilty of first degree murder under s. 231(5)(e) of the Criminal Code.

II.            Facts

[6]                             On January 16, 2015, Mr. McLeod was shot and killed near Prince George, British Columbia, soon after he had been assaulted and unlawfully confined in a pickup truck. Five people had been in the truck: Mr. McLeod; the appellant; the appellant’s girlfriend, Staci Stevenson; the appellant’s brother, Kurtis Sundman; and Sebastian Martin. All five were drug dealers in and around Vanderhoof, British Columbia.

[7]                             The truck had been travelling from Vanderhoof to Prince George. Mr. Kurtis Sundman was driving and Mr. McLeod was in the front passenger seat, while the appellant, Ms. Stevenson, and Mr. Martin were in the back. The appellant and Mr. Kurtis Sundman were each carrying a handgun; Mr. Martin was carrying a shotgun. Mr. McLeod was unarmed.

[8]                             During the trip, a conflict arose between the Sundman brothers and Mr. McLeod. The appellant was angry with Mr. McLeod for many reasons: he suspected that Mr. McLeod was having a relationship with Ms. Stevenson; Mr. McLeod was encroaching on the Sundman brothers’ turf by supplying drugs to the Vanderhoof market; the Sundman brothers owed a drug debt to Mr. McLeod and he was pressuring them to repay the debt; and the appellant had seen messages on Mr. McLeod’s phone that had upset him. At one point, the appellant started hitting Mr. McLeod in the head with his handgun. Mr. McLeod tried to avoid the blows and promised to forgive the Sundmans’ drug debt if they left him alone. Mr. Kurtis Sundman, who shared the appellant’s anger, encouraged the ongoing assault and drove the truck so fast that Mr. McLeod could not jump out. He also taunted Mr. McLeod by telling him to jump out, even though realistically this was impossible.

[9]                             When the truck slowed to make a turn, Mr. McLeod jumped out of the truck and tried to escape. Mr. Kurtis Sundman immediately stopped the truck, and the appellant yelled “get him, get him”. The three men quickly left the truck, each carrying their respective firearms, and chased Mr. McLeod.

[10]                        Mr. McLeod tried desperately to escape. He waded through deep snow, across a shallow ditch and barbed wire fence, towards the bush. The appellant then shot at Mr. McLeod at least four times, hitting him at least three times. Although these shots did not kill Mr. McLeod, they slowed him down and stopped him from escaping. Mr. Martin said to the appellant something to the effect of, “I got him, boss”, and shot Mr. McLeod twice, once in the torso and once in the face at close range, killing him almost instantly.

[11]                        The three men loaded Mr. McLeod’s body into the truck and drove to an isolated location where they hid his body under foliage. The police found the body about a month later with Ms. Stevenson’s help.

[12]                        The appellant and his two accomplices, Mr. Martin and Mr. Kurtis Sundman, were each charged with first degree murder. The accomplices were convicted of second degree murder and manslaughter, respectively. Only the appellant’s case remains before this Court.

III.         Judgments Below

A.           Supreme Court of British Columbia, 2018 BCSC 602 (Williams J.)

[13]                        The Crown argued that the appellant was guilty of first degree murder because the murder was planned and deliberate. Alternatively, the Crown argued that, because the appellant murdered Mr. McLeod “while committing” the offence of unlawful confinement, he was guilty of first degree murder under s. 231(5)(e) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge rejected both arguments and acquitted the appellant of first degree murder but convicted him of second degree murder.

[14]                        The trial judge held that to prove first degree murder under s. 231(5)(e), the Crown had to prove that the appellant murdered Mr. McLeod while he was under “continuing confinement” at the time of his death (para. 289 (CanLII)). The appellant repeatedly assaulted and unlawfully confined Mr. McLeod in the truck, and Mr. McLeod was still “in a situation of vulnerability” when he escaped from the truck as a “consequence of the manner in which he had been dealt with in the truck” (para. 289). However, because Mr. McLeod “managed to escape his confinement” by jumping from the truck, when “Mr. McLeod was shot, his confinement had ended” (para. 288). The brief “gap in time” between the end of Mr. McLeod’s unlawful confinement in the truck and the firing of the fatal shots meant that he was not under “continuing confinement” when he was killed (para. 289). The appellant was thus not guilty of first degree murder under s. 231(5)(e) of the Criminal Code.

B.            Court of Appeal for British Columbia, 2021 BCCA 53, 402 C.C.C. (3d) 463 (Bauman C.J. and Fitch and Grauer JJ.A.)

[15]                        The Court of Appeal unanimously allowed the Crown’s appeal on the acquittal of first degree murder under s. 231(5)(e), set aside the conviction of second degree murder, and substituted a conviction of first degree murder.

[16]                        The Court of Appeal identified two legal errors in the trial decision. First, the trial judge erred in law on the scope of unlawful confinement by requiring that “the victim be physically restrained in an enclosed space” (para. 156). Unlawful confinement only requires “the intentional deprivation of another person’s liberty or the restriction of that person’s movement in the absence of lawful authority and contrary to the person’s wishes” (para. 153). Even after Mr. McLeod had jumped from the truck he was “in no sense free to move about according to his own inclination and desire” (para. 159). “His confinement did not, as a matter of law, end as soon as he bailed from the truck” (para. 159). Applying the trial judge’s undisputed factual findings to the correct legal test for unlawful confinement, the appellant “was committing the offence of unlawful confinement when he shot [Mr.] McLeod” (para. 159).

[17]                          Second, according to the Court of Appeal, the trial judge’s “more fundamental legal error” was in concluding that “the momentary gap in time” between when Mr. McLeod jumped from the truck and when the appellant shot him meant that he could not have murdered Mr. McLeod “while committing” the offence of unlawful confinement (para. 163). Such a “narrow approach” to s. 231(5)(e) diverges from this Court’s interpretation in R. v. Paré, 1987 CanLII 1 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 618, which asks whether the unlawful confinement and murder were part of a single transaction or were temporally and causally connected. The trial judge erred in law by failing to give legal effect to his factual findings. On the facts found by the trial judge, there was a temporal and causal connection between the unlawful confinement and the murder, making the entire course of conduct a single transaction. The temporal connection was established because the gap in time between the unlawful confinement and the murder was “brief” or “momentary” (para. 171). The causal connection was established because Mr. McLeod was still in a situation of vulnerability after he jumped from the truck and tried to escape from his attackers (para. 172). Based on these factual findings, the appellant was guilty of first degree murder.

IV.         Relevant Statutory Provisions

[18]                        The relevant portions of ss. 231 and 279 of the Criminal Code read as follows:

Classification of murder

231 (1) Murder is first degree murder or second degree murder.

       

Planned and deliberate murder

(2) Murder is first degree murder when it is planned and deliberate.

 

. . .

(5) Irrespective of whether a murder is planned and deliberate on the part of any person, murder is first degree murder in respect of a person when the death is caused by that person while committing or attempting to commit an offence under one of the following sections:

(a) section 76 (hijacking an aircraft);

(b) section 271 (sexual assault);

(c) section 272 (sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm);

(d) section 273 (aggravated sexual assault);

(e) section 279 (kidnapping and forcible confinement); or

(f) section 279.1 (hostage taking).

 

. . .

(2) Every one who, without lawful authority, confines, imprisons or forcibly seizes another person is guilty of

(a) an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years; or

(b) an offence punishable on summary conviction.

V.           Issues

[19]                        The appellant raises two main issues:

A.      The Court of Appeal had no basis to interfere with the trial judge’s conclusion that Mr. McLeod’s unlawful confinement ended when he escaped from the truck, and thus the appellant did not murder Mr. McLeod “while committing” the offence of unlawful confinement and is not guilty of first degree murder under s. 231(5)(e) of the Criminal Code; and

B.        The Court of Appeal erred in concluding that Mr. McLeod’s unlawful confinement in the truck and his murder formed part of a “single transaction” justifying a conviction for first degree murder under s. 231(5)(e).

VI.         Analysis

[20]                        I will first review the legal principles for unlawful confinement under s. 279(2) of the Criminal Code and first degree murder under s. 231(5). I will then apply those principles to this case.

A.           Unlawful Confinement

[21]                        To establish unlawful or forcible confinement under s. 279(2) of the Criminal Code, the Crown must prove that (1) the accused confined another person; and (2) the confinement was unlawful (R. v. Magoon, 2018 SCC 14, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 309, at para. 64). At its core, unlawful confinement involves a deprivation of a person’s liberty (R. v. Bottineau, [2006] O.J. No. 1864 (QL), 2006 CarswellOnt 8510 (WL) (S.C.J.), at para. 117, per Watt J. (as he then was), aff’d 2011 ONCA 194, 269 C.C.C. (3d) 227). Unlawful confinement occurs if, for any significant time period, a person is coercively restrained or directed contrary to their wishes, so that they cannot move about according to their own inclination and desire (R. v. Luxton, 1990 CanLII 83 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 711, at p. 723; R. v. Pritchard, 2008 SCC 59, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 195, at para. 24; Magoon, at para. 64). The person need not be restricted to a particular place or physically restrained (Magoon, at para. 64; R. v. Gratton (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 462 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 473 and 475, per Cory J.A. (as he then was); R. v. Lemaigre (1987), 1987 CanLII 4896 (SK CA), 56 Sask. R. 300 (C.A.), at para. 3; M. Manning and P. Sankoff, Manning, Mewett & Sankoff: Criminal Law (5th ed. 2015), at p. 1037). The restraint can be through violence, fear, intimidation or psychological or other means (Magoon, at para. 64). The purpose of the confinement is not relevant (Pritchard, at para. 31; R. v. Kimberley (2001), 2001 CanLII 24120 (ON CA), 56 O.R. (3d) 18 (C.A.), at para. 107; R. v. Johnstone, 2014 ONCA 504, 313 C.C.C. (3d) 34, at para. 45; R. v. Parris, 2013 ONCA 515, 300 C.C.C. (3d) 41, at para. 47).

[22]                        For example, a person can be unlawfully confined if an accused’s violent acts lead the person to lock themselves in a room to avoid being attacked (Johnstone, at para. 47; K. Roach, Criminal Law (7th ed. 2018), at p. 442, fn. 83), or if the person is prevented from escaping from an apartment through the front door (R. v. Newman, 2016 SCC 7, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 1; Roach, at p. 442, fn. 81).

B.            First Degree Murder Under Section 231(5)

(1)         First Degree Murder

[23]                        First degree murder is the most serious crime in Canadian law and requires the highest level of moral blameworthiness, namely subjective foresight of death (R. v. Arkell, 1990 CanLII 82 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 695, at p. 703; Luxton, at p. 724). It carries the most severe punishment under the Criminal Code, a sentence of life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 25 years (s. 745(a); R. v. Russell, 2001 SCC 53, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 804, at para. 46). Any murder that is not first degree murder is second degree murder (s. 231(7)), which carries a punishment of life imprisonment without eligibility for parole of between 10 and 25 years, at the discretion of the sentencing judge (ss. 745(c) and 745.4).

[24]                        First degree murder is murder that is “planned and deliberate” (s. 231(2) and (3)). Murder is also deemed to be in the first degree, even if not planned and deliberate, if it is committed in connection with specific victims, specific situations, or any of several enumerated offences (s. 231(4) to (6.2)). Section 231(5) lists one such group of underlying offences. It provides that murder is first degree murder when the death of a person is caused “while committing or attempting to commit” any of the offences of hijacking an aircraft, any form of sexual assault, kidnapping, hostage taking, or unlawful confinement. Section 231(5) can apply even if the murder victim and the victim of the enumerated offence are different persons (Russell, at paras. 33 and 43; Manning and Sankoff, at p. 961).

(2)         Section 231(5): A Sentencing Provision

[25]                        Section 231(5) does not create a substantive offence. It is essentially a sentencing provision reflecting Parliament’s decision to treat murder in connection with the listed offences as involving a heightened degree of moral blameworthiness or an aggravating circumstance warranting a more severe punishment. Section 231(5) applies only when the offender has been found guilty of murder beyond a reasonable doubt (R. v. Harbottle, 1993 CanLII 71 (SCC), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 306, at p. 323; Arkell, at pp. 702-3; Luxton, at p. 720; Paré, at p. 625; Russell, at para. 24; Pritchard, at para. 19).

[26]                        This Court has held that s. 231(5) is neither arbitrary nor irrational and does not infringe ss. 7, 9, or 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Arkell, at p. 704; Luxton, at pp. 719-25; D. Stuart, Canadian Criminal Law: A Treatise (8th ed. 2020), at p. 234; Manning and Sankoff, at p. 958).

(3)         The Organizing Principle of Illegal Domination

[27]                        The organizing principle for the offences listed in s. 231(5) — what they have in common — is that they are all crimes involving the illegal domination of victims. Parliament has treated murder committed in connection with these crimes of domination as especially serious and as warranting the exceptional punishment for first degree murder (Paré, at p. 633; Luxton, at p. 722; R. v. Nette, 2001 SCC 78, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 488, at para. 62; Pritchard, at paras. 19-20; Magoon, at para. 61). Illegal domination is not an essential element to be proved under s. 231(5) but a principle that helps courts apply the provision purposively, so that the law develops in a principled manner (Russell, at para. 43; Kimberley, at para. 104; R. v. Niemi, 2017 ONCA 720, 355 C.C.C. (3d) 344, at para. 62; R. v. Imona-Russell, 2018 ONCA 590, at para. 13 (CanLII); R. v. McGregor, 2019 ONCA 307, 145 O.R. (3d) 641, at paras. 58, 67 and 69-74).

(4)         “While Committing”: The Single Transaction Test

[28]                        This Court has provided guidance on what it means to commit murder “while committing or attempting to commit” an underlying offence listed in s. 231(5). In Paré, this Court’s leading interpretation of s. 231(5), the offender indecently assaulted a young boy, held him down for two minutes, and then strangled him to death when the boy said that he would tell his mother of the assault. Wilson J. for the Court rejected a narrow and literal interpretation of “while committing” under s. 231(5) that would require the underlying offence and the murder to be committed simultaneously. Such an interpretation would lead to irrational and arbitrary distinctions — in Paré, for example, applying the “simultaneous” interpretation would mean that whether the murder was in the first or second degree would turn on whether the offender was viewed as still indecently assaulting the victim when he held him down and strangled him. Instead of a “simultaneous” approach to s. 231(5), Wilson J. adopted the broad and purposive “single transaction” approach proposed by Martin J.A. in R. v. Stevens (1984), 1984 CanLII 3481 (ON CA), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 518 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 541, which asks if the listed offence of domination and the killing “all form part of one continuous sequence of events forming a single transaction”. Wilson J. held that “it is the continuing illegal domination of the victim which gives continuity to the sequence of events culminating in the murder. The murder represents an exploitation of the position of power created by the underlying crime and makes the entire course of conduct a ‘single transaction’” (p. 633). Applying this test, the offender in Paré was guilty of first degree murder because the indecent assault and the killing formed “part of one continuous sequence of events” constituting “the same transaction” (p. 634).

[29]                        A few years after deciding Paré, this Court in Harbottle, at p. 325, distilled s. 231(5) (then s. 214(5) of the Criminal Code) into five elements:

(1)   [T]he accused was guilty of the underlying crime of domination or of attempting to commit that crime;

 

(2)   the accused was guilty of the murder of the victim;

 

(3)   the accused participated in the murder in such a manner that he was a substantial cause of the death of the victim;

 

(4)   there was no intervening act of another which resulted in the accused no longer being substantially connected to the death of the victim; and

 

(5)   the crimes of domination and murder were part of the same transaction; that is to say, the death was caused while committing the offence of domination as part of the same series of events.

 

(See also Magoon, at paras. 17 and 63.)

[30]                        Section 231(5) thus requires (1) an underlying crime of domination; (2) murder; (3) substantial cause; (4) no intervening act; and (5) the same transaction (Parris, at para. 45; McGregor, at para. 61).

(5)         “While Committing”: The Temporal and Causal Connection Approach

[31]                        In some cases, this Court has applied the “single transaction” test under s. 231(5) by asking whether the underlying offence of domination and the murder have a close “temporal and causal” connection (see Paré, at pp. 629 and 634; Pritchard, at paras. 19, 25, 33-35 and 38; Russell, at paras. 43 and 46-47).

[32]                        In other cases, this Court has simply applied the “single transaction” test as enunciated by Martin J.A. in Stevens, without expressly inquiring into the presence of a temporal-causal connection (Harbottle, at p. 326; Magoon, at paras. 73-75; see also R. v. Ganton (1992), 1992 CanLII 8246 (SK CA), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 259 (Sask. C.A.), at p. 263; R. v. Johnson and Jensen (1993), 1993 CanLII 16414 (AB CA), 141 A.R. 184 (C.A.), at para. 53; R. v. Plewes, 2000 BCCA 278, 144 C.C.C. (3d) 426, at para. 34; R. v. Westergard (2004), 2004 CanLII 16356 (ON CA), 24 C.R. (6th) 375 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 30; R. v. Mullings, 2014 ONCA 895, 319 C.C.C. (3d) 1, at para. 102). Similarly, the Canadian Judicial Council’s Model Jury Instructions on s. 231(5) focus solely on whether the underlying offence and the killing form “a continuous series of events that was a single ongoing transaction” (“Offence 231(5): First Degree Murder in the Commission of Another Offence”, May 2019 (online); see also D. Watt, Watt’s Manual of Criminal Jury Instructions (2nd ed. 2015), at pp. 716 and 719).

[33]                        It is usually easy to identify a “temporal connection” between an underlying offence of domination and a murder: it is when the two criminal acts are committed close together in time. But it can be harder to articulate the “causal connection” between an underlying offence and a murder. The difficulty is largely terminological. Causation in homicide cases has two aspects: factual causation and legal causation. Factual causation asks how the victim died and the role of the accused in effecting that result — whether the victim’s death would have occurred “but for” the actions of the accused. When factual causation is established, legal causation asks whether the accused should be held responsible for the victim’s death, based on principles of moral responsibility in criminal law (Nette, at paras. 44-45; R. v. Maybin, 2012 SCC 24, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 30, at paras. 15-16). Under s. 231(5), however, a “causal connection” involves neither factual nor legal causation. As the Court of Appeal for British Columbia remarked in another context, “[o]ne can murder someone ‘in the course of’ committing a robbery, but the robbery is only the context of the murder, not its ‘cause’” (Grayson v. Wellington Insurance Co. (1997), 1997 CanLII 4112 (BC CA), 37 B.C.L.R. (3d) 49, at para. 26, per Newbury J.A.).

[34]                        Instead, a causal connection has been found under s. 231(5) where the offender’s reason or motivation for the killing arises from, or is linked to, the offender’s unlawful domination of a victim. In Paré, Wilson J. found a causal connection between the underlying offence and the killing because the accused strangled the victim to death after indecently assaulting him to prevent him from telling his mother about the assault (p. 634; see also Pritchard, at para. 34). The indecent assault was not the factual or legal cause of the murder; it was the reason or motivation for it, marking the beginning of a continuing process of illegal domination culminating in the murder, thus making the entire course of conduct a single transaction (Paré, at p. 633). Likewise, a causal connection has been found under s. 231(5) when the murder was committed to facilitate the crime of domination, such as by eliminating a potential witness to the crime (Pritchard, at para. 38; Russell, at paras. 47-48; R. v. Alexis, 2020 ONCA 334, 388 C.C.C. (3d) 226, at para. 18). In all cases, a “causal connection” under s. 231(5) concerns whether there is a unifying relationship, beyond mere closeness in time, between the act of illegal domination and the act of murder, so as to constitute a single transaction (see Alexis, at para. 24).

(6)         The Single Transaction Test and the Temporal-Causal Connection Approach Involve the Same Inquiry

[35]                        I do not read this Court’s decisions as suggesting that the “single transaction” test articulated in Stevens and the temporal-causal connection approach involve different inquiries. They are simply different ways of addressing the “same transaction” element. These two approaches have been used interchangeably in our jurisprudence.

[36]                        For example, in Paré, at p. 634, Wilson J. concluded that “[t]he murder was temporally and causally connected to the underlying offence. It formed part of one continuous sequence of events. It was part of the same transaction.”

[37]                        Similarly, in Russell, at para. 46, McLachlin C.J. referred to the single transaction test and the temporal-causal connection approach interchangeably:

The cases of this Court dealing with s. 231(5) make clear that an accused commits a murder “while committing or attempting to commit” an enumerated offence only if there is a close temporal and causal connection between the murder and the enumerated offence: see, e.g., Paré, supra, at p. 632 (stating that a murder is committed “while committing” an enumerated offence only “where the act causing death and the acts constituting [the enumerated offence] all form part of one continuous sequence of events forming a single transaction”); R. v. Kirkness, 1990 CanLII 57 (SCC), [1990] 3 S.C.R. 74, at p. 86. [Emphasis added.]

[38]                        Lastly, in Pritchard, Binnie J. stated that there must be a “close temporal and causative link” for s. 231(5) to apply (para. 33, quoting Paré, at p. 629). In the same paragraph, he explained that the murder will occur “while committing” a listed offence when the two crimes occur together in the course of a “single transaction”.

[39]                        Accordingly, properly applied, the single transaction test and temporal‑causal connection approach involve the same inquiry and will result in the same conclusion. When a single transaction is found, there will necessarily be a temporal‑causal connection. Likewise, when a temporal-causal connection is found, there will necessarily be a single transaction.

(7)         Distinct Criminal Acts

[40]                        Finally, this Court has ruled that the underlying offence of domination and the killing must involve two distinct criminal acts (Pritchard, at para. 27, citing Kimberley, at para. 108, per Doherty J.A.; Magoon, at para. 74; see also Manning and Sankoff, at pp. 961-62). The underlying offence cannot be “consumed in the very act of killing”; in other words, the underlying offence and the killing must not be one and the same (Pritchard, at para. 27). If there is only one criminal act, it cannot be said that the offender exploited the domination inherent in the underlying offence with the act of killing (para. 29). In such cases, the heightened moral blameworthiness required for first degree murder is absent.

C.            Application

[41]                        There is no issue before this Court that the appellant was guilty of murdering Mr. McLeod even though he did not fire the fatal shot. The trial judge found that the appellant shot at Mr. McLeod with lethal intent and hit him at least three times. The parties do not dispute that these shots were a substantial cause of Mr. McLeod’s death because they prevented him from escaping his captors, before he was shot and killed at close range. The only dispute before this Court is whether the murder was in the first or the second degree. This turns on (1) whether Mr. McLeod was still unlawfully confined after he escaped from the truck; and (2) whether the unlawful confinement (inside or outside the truck, or both) and the murder were part of the same transaction.

(1)         Mr. McLeod Was Still Unlawfully Confined When He Escaped From the Truck and Ran for His Life

[42]                        The trial judge correctly concluded that the appellant unlawfully confined Mr. McLeod inside the truck because he was “coercively restrained and unable to move about according to his own inclination and desire” (para. 287). He erred in law, however, in concluding that Mr. McLeod “managed to escape his confinement” by jumping from the truck, and that “at the time Mr. McLeod was shot, his confinement had ended” (para. 288). The trial judge appears to have concluded that because Mr. McLeod was no longer physically restrained outside the truck, he was no longer unlawfully confined. However, physical restraint in a particular place is sufficient but not necessary to establish unlawful confinement. Even if Mr. McLeod were no longer physically restrained outside the truck, he remained coercively restrained through acts of violence, fear, and intimidation as he ran for his life. He continued to be deprived of his liberty and could not move about according to his inclination and desire. Crown counsel made this point vividly during oral argument before this Court:

If Mr. McLeod was free to move about according to his own inclination and desire, the [Crown] would hazard to guess that instead of running through deep snow, cutting across fences, poorly dressed in the dead of night in rural Prince George, he would have instead sought out the nearest house, sought some shelter and tried to arrange transport back to his rental car in Vanderhoof.

 

(transcript, at p. 23)

[43]                        The trial judge himself recognized Mr. McLeod’s continuing loss of liberty, finding that “Mr. McLeod was still in a situation of vulnerability, and that vulnerability was the consequence of the manner in which he had been dealt with in the truck” (para. 289).

[44]                        The appellant claims that this line of analysis was precluded before the Court of Appeal and this Court, because it (1) does not involve a question of law alone and (2) is a new theory of liability on appeal. I would reject both claims.

[45]                        First, I do not accept that the trial judge’s conclusion that Mr. McLeod was no longer unlawfully confined outside the truck is a question of mixed fact and law, falling outside the Crown’s right of appeal to the Court of Appeal on “a question of law alone” under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The Crown’s appeal did not challenge the trial judge’s findings of fact or raise a question of how to weigh the evidence and assess whether it meets the standard of proof. Rather, it challenged the legal effect of the trial judge’s findings of fact and his misapprehension of the law relating to unlawful confinement, both of which involve “a question of law alone” falling within the Crown’s right of appeal (R. v. Chung, 2020 SCC 8, at paras. 10-11; R. v. J.M.H., 2011 SCC 45, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 197, at paras. 28-30). The trial judge erred in law by viewing unlawful confinement as requiring (1) physical restraint and (2) that the physical restraint be in an enclosed space. As a matter of law, neither element is required.

[46]                        Second, I reject the appellant’s assertion that whether Mr. McLeod remained unlawfully confined after he escaped from the truck was a new theory of liability that was not advanced at trial. Like the Court of Appeal (at paras. 134-38), I accept that the Crown’s closing submission urged that “the murder was committed in the course of an unlawful conf[inement]” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 60; see also p. 61 (“a murder in the course of an unlawful confinement”)). The theory of unlawful confinement outside the truck was thus properly raised at trial.

[47]                        As a result, the Court of Appeal correctly held that Mr. McLeod remained unlawfully confined after he escaped from the truck.

[48]                        The remaining issue is whether the appellant murdered Mr. McLeod “while committing” the offence of unlawful confinement; that is, whether these two criminal acts were part of the same transaction.

(2)         The Appellant Murdered Mr. McLeod “While Committing” the Offence of Unlawful Confinement

[49]                        Like the Court of Appeal (at paras. 173-74), I have no difficulty concluding that the appellant murdered Mr. McLeod “while committing” the offence of unlawful confinement. The unlawful confinement and the murder were part of one continuous sequence of events forming a single transaction. The unlawful confinement and the murder were close in time — in fact, Mr. McLeod was still unlawfully confined at the time of his death. The unlawful confinement and the murder also involved an ongoing course of domination consisting of intimidation, fear, and violence. The course of domination started in the truck, continued when Mr. McLeod jumped from the moving truck and was chased by the appellant and his accomplices, and ended with his murder. The two criminal acts were also distinct: the unlawful confinement — including the restriction of Mr. McLeod’s freedom of movement inside and outside the truck and the ongoing acts of violence, fear, and intimidation — was distinct from and not consumed by the shooting. These conclusions amply justified a verdict of first degree murder.

[50]                        In view of this conclusion, it is not necessary to also apply the temporal‑causal connection approach, as the finding of a single transaction necessarily means that a temporal-causal connection is established. In any event, the temporal‑causal connection inquiry yields the same conclusion. The unlawful confinement and the murder were connected temporally because Mr. McLeod was unlawfully confined shortly before and at the time of his death. They were also connected causally, by sharing a unifying relationship, because the appellant murdered Mr. McLeod as he was trying to escape from his unlawful confinement. The first degree murder verdict was thus justified on the basis of the close temporal-causal connection between the unlawful confinement and the murder.

[51]                        I would reject the appellant’s contention that whether the unlawful confinement and the murder of Mr. McLeod were temporally and causally connected is a question of fact from which the Crown had no right of appeal to the Court of Appeal. Like the Court of Appeal (at paras. 169-75), I conclude that the trial judge erred in law by concluding that the “brief . . . gap in time” between the unlawful confinement in the truck and the murder precluded these criminal acts being part of the same transaction. The trial judge erroneously insisted that the unlawful confinement and the murder must be simultaneous, a view that this Court has consistently rejected since Paré.

[52]                        Further, as the Court of Appeal held (at para. 169), even had the trial judge been correct that the unlawful confinement ended once Mr. McLeod jumped from the truck, the trial judge should have considered whether that unlawful confinement and the murder formed a single transaction. For the reasons already stated, they undoubtedly did.

[53]                        In conclusion — and to state the obvious — if the appellant had shot and killed Mr. McLeod when he was unlawfully confined in the truck, the appellant would unquestionably be found to have murdered Mr. McLeod “while committing” the offence of unlawful confinement. As a matter of law and common sense, Mr. McLeod’s brief escape from the truck cannot mitigate the appellant’s crime. On any sensible view, the appellant’s moral blameworthiness cannot be considered to be lower simply because Mr. McLeod managed to jump from a moving truck and was running for his life when he was executed just moments later. In both cases, the appellant’s moral blameworthiness is exceptionally high; in both cases, it is equally deserving of “a societal denunciation of those offenders who choose to exploit their position of dominance and power to the point of murder” (Luxton, at p. 723).

[54]                        The Court of Appeal was thus correct in finding the appellant guilty of first degree murder under s. 231(5)(e) of the Criminal Code.

VII.      Disposition

[55]                        I would dismiss the appeal.

                  Brown J. —

I.               Overview

[1]                             This appeal calls upon the Court to affirm and apply its holdings in R. v. Le, 2019 SCC 34, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 692, and R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, respectively, on two points: (1) evaluating whether an individual has been detained by the police; and (2) applying the framework in R. v. Sinclair, 2010 SCC 35, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 310, in the purposive and generous manner required by our jurisprudence.

[2]                             The police suspected that Nigel Vernon Lafrance might have been involved in the death of an individual that took place on March 17, 2015. In the early morning of March 19, 2015, a team of armed police officers entered his home to execute a search warrant. They awoke Mr. Lafrance, a recent high school graduate described by the trial judge as “youthful, [I]ndigenous and ha[ving] minimal police exposure” (2017 ABQB 746, 399 C.R.R. (2d) 184, at para. 79), and by the Court of Appeal as “19 years old, Indigenous, [with] very limited prior exposure to the police and . . . of much smaller stature than . . . the armed and uniformed officers” (2021 ABCA 51, 20 Alta. L.R. (7th) 211, at para. 29). Ordered to dress and leave the premises, he was then led to a police officer who asked him to identify himself and come to the police station to provide a statement regarding the alleged murder. The police drove him to the police station, took him to a secure environment therein, and interviewed him for over three hours.

[3]                             On April 7, 2015, the police arrested Mr. Lafrance for murder. After allowing him to call Legal Aid, they interviewed him. Several hours into the interview, Mr. Lafrance asked to call his father because that would be his “only chance of getting a lawyer” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 137). The police refused the request and pushed for answers. Mr. Lafrance eventually confessed to killing the victim.

[4]                             Mr. Lafrance sought to exclude this confession by arguing that the police had detained him on March 19 and breached his right to counsel pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms on March 19 and April 7.[1] The trial judge admitted the evidence, finding that Mr. Lafrance had not been detained on March 19 (thereby also disposing of the s. 10(b) argument related to that date), and that police were not required to allow him a second opportunity to call a lawyer on April 7. Mr. Lafrance was convicted by a jury of second‑degree murder. The majority of the Court of Appeal of Alberta allowed his appeal, excluded the evidence under s. 24(2) of the Charter and ordered a new trial. The Crown appeals, asking us to restore the conviction.

[5]                             I would dismiss the appeal. The police detained Mr. Lafrance on March 19, then breached s. 10(b) by failing to inform him of his right to counsel. They committed another breach of s. 10(b) on April 7 by refusing to allow him to contact a lawyer in circumstances which showed that his initial conversation with Legal Aid was insufficient for the purposes of s. 10(b), being “to allow the detainee not only to be informed of his rights and obligations under the law but, equally if not more important, to obtain advice as to how to exercise those rights” (Sinclair, at para. 26, citing R. v. Manninen, 1987 CanLII 67 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1233, at pp. 1242-43). These were serious breaches, substantially impacting Mr. Lafrance’s Charter‑protected interests, and admitting the evidence thereby obtained would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

II.            Facts

[6]                             On March 17, 2015, Anthony Yasinski was stabbed in the neck and died. The police suspected Mr. Lafrance’s involvement, as he was the last person to have contacted Mr. Yasinski prior to his death.

[7]                             Two interactions between the police and Mr. Lafrance followed, on March 19, 2015, and April 7, 2015, respectively.

A.           March 19, 2015

[8]                             The police sought and obtained a search warrant to search Mr. Lafrance’s place of residence on the morning of March 19. A police search team of 11 ⸺ many of which were wearing bulletproof vests and carrying firearms, including at least one “assault rifle” ⸺ arrived in marked and unmarked police vehicles at 6:50 a.m., blocked off surrounding roads and entered the residence, making their way to Mr. Lafrance’s room and waking him. When he opened the door, they directed him to dress and leave his house immediately. When he asked the police for permission to look for his cat (which had run outside when the police entered the residence), they permitted him to do so, led him outside, and accompanied him as he chased after it. At all times, Mr. Lafrance remained “in sight of police officers” and did not venture past the police cordon (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 93-94).

[9]                             Shortly after retrieving the cat, Mr. Lafrance was approached by Sergeant (then Corporal) Eros who, unbeknownst to Mr. Lafrance, had been assigned to interview him and had been waiting for him outside. Sgt. Eros was accompanied by Staff Sergeant (then Cpl.) Zazulak, armed and wearing a bulletproof vest. It is undisputed that, at that time, Sgt. Eros did not have reasonable and probable grounds to proceed to arrest Mr. Lafrance.

[10]                        Sgt. Eros asked Mr. Lafrance to confirm his identity (which Mr. Lafrance did), advised him that he wanted to speak about an incident that occurred down the road — referring, of course, to Mr. Yasinski’s death — and asked him to come to the police station and provide a statement. Sgt. Eros told Mr. Lafrance that doing so would be a “completely voluntary” choice. Mr. Lafrance agreed to give a statement.

[11]                        Sgt. Eros and Mr. Lafrance discussed how he could make his way to the police station — whether by public transit, a ride with Sgt. Eros and S/Sgt. Zazulak in an unmarked police van, or by some alternative means. Having no money for bus fare, Mr. Lafrance chose to ride with Sgt. Eros and S/Sgt. Zazulak.

[12]                        After a 20- to 25‑minute ride to the police station, Mr. Lafrance was escorted by Sgt. Eros and S/Sgt. Zazulak through two controlled access key‑carded doors to an interview room at the back of the station. He was then left alone in the closed room for at least 17 minutes, unaware (because he had not been told) that the door was unlocked. When Sgt. Eros returned to the interview room and Mr. Lafrance asked to use the washroom, Sgt. Eros escorted him to the washroom, stood by while Mr. Lafrance used the washroom, then escorted him back to the interview room.

[13]                        Sgt. Eros then proceeded to interview Mr. Lafrance for approximately three and a half hours. He began by telling Mr. Lafrance that he did not need to speak with him, that the door to the interview room was unlocked and that he could leave at any time. But Sgt. Eros also informed him that they were currently in a “secure environment” and that, should Mr. Lafrance want to leave, use the washroom or take a smoke break, he would have to let Sgt. Eros know.

[14]                        Sgt. Eros then informed Mr. Lafrance that he was a suspect in Mr. Yasinski’s murder, and asked him about “what [his] days have been filled with and what [he had] been doing” prior to the police search of his home (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 82). Mr. Lafrance gave answers, some of which were relayed to the search team, leading them to seize items of interest. Sgt. Eros also took Mr. Lafrance’s fingerprints and DNA (prior to which he was offered a chance to speak with a lawyer) and seized his cellphone along with his clothes — all of which were taken after obtaining Mr. Lafrance’s consent. At the interview’s conclusion, police drove Mr. Lafrance home.

B.            April 7, 2015

[15]                        On April 7, the police arrested Mr. Lafrance for the murder of Mr. Yasinski. Shortly after the arrest, the arresting officer informed Mr. Lafrance of his right to counsel and that he would be given an opportunity to call a lawyer. Mr. Lafrance indicated that he understood this and asked to contact a “free lawyer”.

[16]                        At the police station, Mr. Lafrance was escorted to a telephone room and spoke on the phone with a Legal Aid lawyer. This short conversation was Mr. Lafrance’s first time ever speaking with a lawyer, having never before been arrested or otherwise required to obtain legal services. When he finished the call, the arresting officer asked Mr. Lafrance if he had spoken to a lawyer and understood the advice, to which Mr. Lafrance answered yes. Mr. Lafrance was then moved to an interview room to be interviewed by Sgt. Eros.

[17]                        Several hours into the interview, Sgt. Eros told Mr. Lafrance that he did not believe his version of the events and that there was no doubt in his mind that Mr. Lafrance was responsible for killing Mr. Yasinski. As the tone of the interview shifted, Mr. Lafrance asked to speak with his father before continuing to answer Sgt. Eros’ questions. When Sgt. Eros asked him why, Mr. Lafrance explained that his father was his “only chance of getting a lawyer” and that he wanted a lawyer before going forward with anything else. He said that Legal Aid told him “to get a lawyer before [he] continue[s] talking” to sit down and talk about his situation (A.R., vol. V, at p. 139). In response, Sgt. Eros explained that he “ha[d] no problem” letting him talk to his father (A.R., vol. V, at p. 138), but that Mr. Lafrance had already spoken to a lawyer. Mr. Lafrance, he said, may have misinterpreted[2] the advice and so he explained to Mr. Lafrance that he could not have a lawyer present in the room with him during the custodial interview. Sgt. Eros testified, however, that he was satisfied that Mr. Lafrance understood his right to silence and his legal advice.

[18]                        Sgt. Eros pressed ahead with his questioning and, shortly thereafter, Mr. Lafrance confessed to stabbing Mr. Yasinski.

III.         Issues

[19]                        This appeal presents three issues:

1.            Did the police detain Mr. Lafrance and breach his s. 10(b) right to counsel on March 19, 2015?

2.            Did the police breach Mr. Lafrance’s s. 10(b) right to counsel by refusing to allow him to have a further consultation with a lawyer on April 7, 2015?

3.            If the answer to either or both of the foregoing is “yes”, would the evidence obtained therefrom bring the administration of justice into disrepute, such that it must be excluded under s. 24(2)?

IV.         Analysis

A.           March 19, 2015

[20]                        Mr. Lafrance’s straightforward argument regarding the March 19 encounter is this: he was detained when the police executed their search warrant, and that detention persisted during his interview at the police station as he felt, in the circumstances, obliged to comply with the request to speak with police. It follows that the police breached s. 10(b) by failing to advise him of his right to retain and instruct counsel upon detention (Grant, at para. 28).

(1)         Detention

[21]                        Detention refers to “a suspension of an individual’s liberty interest by virtue of a significant physical or psychological restraint at the hands of the state” (R. v. Suberu, 2009 SCC 33, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 460, at para. 21; Le, at para. 27). In the heat of the moment, it is not always easy for ordinary citizens, who may be uninformed of their rights or the scope of the police’s powers, to know whether they have a choice to comply with a request by the police. An individual may perceive “a routine interaction with the police as demanding a sense of obligation to comply with every request” (Le, at para. 26, referring to S. Penney, V. Rondinelli and J. Stribopoulos, Criminal Procedure in Canada (2nd ed. 2018), at p. 83). For that reason, this Court has recognized that, “even absent physical restraint by the state, a detention exists in situations where a reasonable person in the accused’s shoes would feel obligated to comply . . . and that they are not free to leave” (Le, at para. 26 (emphasis added)). Even so, not every encounter between state and citizen effects a detention (Suberu, at para. 3; Le, at para. 27); no detention is effected, and therefore s. 10(b) rights are not breached, where an individual voluntarily assists the police by, for example, freely agreeing to provide a statement.

[22]                        In this case, Mr. Lafrance says that his choice to cooperate with the police on March 19 was, in substance, imposed by way of psychological constraints. Psychological detention exists where an individual is legally required to comply with a direction or demand by the police, or where “a reasonable person in [that individual’s] position would feel so obligated” and would “conclude that he or she was not free to go” (Grant, at paras. 30‑31; Le, at para. 25). It is that latter category which Mr. Lafrance says describes his circumstances. Three factors — identified in Grant and expanded upon in Le — are to be considered and balanced:

1.            The circumstances giving rise to the encounter as they would reasonably be perceived by the individual;

2.            The nature of the police conduct; and

3.            The particular characteristics or circumstances of the individual where relevant (Grant, at para. 44; Le, at para. 31).

[23]                        The applicable standard of review here is that of correctness; the existence of a detention is a question of law (R. v. Shepherd, 2009 SCC 35, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 527, at paras. 18 and 20; Grant, at para. 43; Le, at para. 23). No deference is owed to the trial judge’s analysis and conclusion thereon. This is not to say that the voir dire is irrelevant, since the trial judge’s findings of facts receive deference, absent a palpable and overriding error (Grant, at paras. 43 and 45).

(2)         R. v. Moran

[24]                        A jurisprudential point should be addressed before proceeding further. The Court of Appeal criticized the trial judge for not considering the factors pertinent to identifying a detention in R. v. Moran (1987), 1987 CanLII 124 (ON CA), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.). In my view, however, the trial judge did not err in this respect, since Grant has displaced the authority of Moran as stating the test for detention.

[25]                        In Moran, an issue before the Court of Appeal for Ontario was whether the trial judge had erred in concluding that Mr. Moran, who had been interviewed twice by police in connection with the murder of which he was eventually convicted, had not been detained during those interviews. In dismissing this ground of appeal, Martin J.A. identified a series of non‑exhaustive factors to assist in determining whether a person is detained at the time of questioning at a police station.

[26]                        I recognize that lower courts continue to refer to these factors when assessing detention under Grant (see, e.g., R. v. Seagull, 2015 BCCA 164, 323 C.C.C. (3d) 361, at para. 38; R. v. Tessier, 2020 ABCA 289, 12 Alta. L.R. (7th) 55, at paras. 66‑69, leave to appeal granted, Bulletin of Proceedings, March 4, 2021, at p. 2; R. v. Eaton, 2019 ONCA 891, at para. 12 (CanLII); R. v. N.B., 2018 ONCA 556, 362 C.C.C. (3d) 302, at para. 121). The view, whether stated explicitly or necessarily implicit in these judgments, is that the Moran factors are “useful” benchmarks when assessing detention per Grant (Seagull, at para. 38; N.B., at para. 121).

[27]                        Respectfully, the better view is that, as a result of Grant, Moran is no longer good law (S. Coughlan and G. Luther, Detention and Arrest (2nd ed. 2017), at p. 287), and it should no longer be applied or relied upon. In Grant, the test for detention was restated to direct the inquiry to the perspective of the reasonable person in the accused’s shoes. In contrast, the Moran factors focus principally on police conduct and information that will not be readily available to the accused at the time of detention (such as the stage of the police investigation). And, while the test in Grant is objective, Moran encourages courts to consider the subjective perceptions and beliefs of the accused, thereby emphasizing considerations that play a limited (if any) role in an objective assessment (Le, at paras. 111-17).

[28]                        Further, and as noted, the scope of Moran is, by its own terms, confined to deciding whether a person who is questioned at a police station is detained. By design, then, Moran applied in limited circumstances. Grant is comprehensive in scope, applying to every instance of alleged detention by police by addressing the full breadth of circumstances that engage the right against self‑incrimination protected by s. 10 of the Charter, including investigative detentions (R. v. Folker, 2016 NLCA 1, 373 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 49, at paras. 74-79, per White J.A. (dissenting in part)).

(3)         Applying Grant to the Events of March 19, 2015

(a)           The Circumstances Giving Rise to the Encounter

[29]                        At this stage, the Court must consider how the circumstances of the encounter would have been reasonably perceived by Mr. Lafrance ⸺ more specifically, “whether the police were providing general assistance; maintaining general order; making general inquiries regarding a particular occurrence; or, singling [him out] for focused investigation” (Le, at para. 31(a); Grant, at para. 44(2)(a)).

[30]                        I observe that the trial judge began by looking to the background information available to Sgt. Eros and the police during the initial steps of their investigation, including his assignment to speak to Mr. Lafrance outside the home. In Le, however (which I note was unavailable to the trial judge at the time of decision), the Court explained that “investigative purposes are important when assessing whether the detention was arbitrary and whether the police were acting in good faith”, but “are less relevant” when reviewing the first Grant factor (paras. 37-38). Behind‑the‑scenes knowledge of a police investigation would not be known by a reasonable person in the accused’s position.

[31]                        The analysis properly begins at the moment the encounter itself begins — in this case, when the police arrived at Mr. Lafrance’s home in marked and unmarked police vehicles, and at an early hour when Mr. Lafrance was asleep. Armed and wearing bulletproof vests, they entered the house, knocked on his bedroom door, and ordered him to dress and get out. They monitored him inside and outside the house.

[32]                        In my view, it is inconceivable that a reasonable person in Mr. Lafrance’s shoes — woken and confronted by armed police officers in his home telling him to leave — would believe that they had arrived to “provid[e] general assistance”, “maintai[n] general order” or make “general inquiries”. The reasonable person would immediately understand that he or she is being singled out for investigation. While, of course, the police were authorized by warrant and as such had “legitimate reasons” for the steps they took, this is not determinative of — and indeed is unlikely to affect — how a reasonable person perceives his or her interactions with the police (Le, at paras. 37‑38). Indeed, the warrant itself, by authorizing the police to search Mr. Lafrance’s home, reveals a targeted investigation.

[33]                        While the trial judgment recounts the facts of this initial police encounter (at para. 37), little consideration is given to the possibility that they gave rise to a detention. The trial judge’s focus, rather, was on the initial interaction between Mr. Lafrance and Sgt. Eros. But again, it is the moment that the interaction with police begins that must be considered. Mr. Lafrance’s interaction with Sgt. Eros was an extension of a series of events that began when the police entered Mr. Lafrance’s home, woke him up and ordered him to dress and leave. In any event, even had the conversation between Sgt. Eros and Mr. Lafrance corresponded to the moment that detention arose, my conclusion would be the same: a reasonable person in Mr. Lafrance’s position would have felt singled out for investigation purposes when Sgt. Eros approached him, asked him to confirm his identity, and informed him that the police wanted to speak with him about a murder. This weighs in favour of a finding of detention.

(b)         The Nature of the Police Conduct

[34]                        The second Grant factor directs a court’s attention to the nature of the police conduct throughout the encounter. Specifically, their actions and language used, their use of physical contact, the place where the encounter occurred, the presence of others, and the duration of the encounter, may all play a role in shaping the perceptions of the reasonable person in the accused’s shoes (Grant, at para. 44(2)(b); Le, at paras. 31(b) and 43).

(i)            Actions and Language of the Police

[35]                        A central feature of the Crown’s position is its argument that an encounter is prima facie voluntary where the police explicitly inform an individual that he or she need not cooperate. This, the Crown says, functions as an intervening event that informs the interpretation of preceding and subsequent events so as to eliminate any possibility of police detention. The Crown relies particularly on these passages from Grant:

     The objective nature of this inquiry recognizes that the police must be able to know when a detention occurs, in order to allow them to fulfill their attendant obligations under the Charter and afford the individual its added protections. However, the subjective intentions of the police are not determinative. (Questions such as police “good faith” may become relevant when the test for exclusion of evidence under s. 24(2) is applied, in cases where a Charter breach is found.) While the test is objective, the individual’s particular circumstances and perceptions at the time may be relevant in assessing the reasonableness of any perceived power imbalance between the individual and the police, and thus the reasonableness of any perception that he or she had no choice but to comply with the police directive. To answer the question whether there is a detention involves a realistic appraisal of the entire interaction as it developed, not a minute parsing of words and movements. In those situations where the police may be uncertain whether their conduct is having a coercive effect on the individual, it is open to them to inform the subject in unambiguous terms that he or she is under no obligation to answer questions and is free to go. It is for the trial judge, applying the proper legal principles to the particular facts of the case, to determine whether the line has been crossed between police conduct that respects liberty and the individual’s right to choose, and conduct that does not.

 

. . .

 

     Effective law enforcement is highly dependent on the cooperation of members of the public. The police must be able to act in a manner that fosters this cooperation, not discourage it. However, police investigative powers are not without limits. The notion of psychological detention recognizes the reality that police tactics, even in the absence of exercising actual physical restraint, may be coercive enough to effectively remove the individual’s choice to walk away from the police. This creates the risk that the person may reasonably feel compelled to incriminate himself or herself. Where that is the case, the police are no longer entitled simply to expect cooperation from an individual. Unless, as stated earlier, the police inform the person that he or she is under no obligation to answer questions and is free to go, a detention may well crystallize and, when it does, the police must provide the subject with his or her s. 10(b) rights. That the obligation arises only on detention represents part of the balance between, on the one hand, the individual rights protected by ss. 9 and 10 and enjoyed by all members of society, and on the other, the collective interest of all members of society in the ability of the police to act on their behalf to investigate and prevent crime. [Emphasis added; paras. 32 and 39.]

[36]                        On their own, these passages might support the Crown’s position. But in light of the entire judgment in Grant, they do not support the view that such a police statement precludes finding a detention. In Grant, the Court conceived the test for detention so that no single consideration — including a statement from the police that the individual need not speak to them or could leave — would be determinative. Rather, what is required, as the first of these passages also states, is “a realistic appraisal of the entire interaction as it developed” (para. 32 (emphasis added)). The passages in Grant relied on by the Crown were, therefore, immediately coupled with the caution that it is ultimately “for the trial judge, applying the proper legal principles to the particular facts of the case, to determine whether the line has been crossed between police conduct that respects liberty and the individual’s right to choose, and conduct that does not” (para. 32). In other words, the assessment requires a broad view directed to all circumstances of the case, from which view a court should not be distracted by a police officer’s statement that might, taken in isolation, militate against the finding of a detention. It is entirely possible that such an assurance, given at a very specific point and time of the interaction with the police, might lose any significance to a reasonable person in the detainee’s circumstances once the entirety of the encounter is accounted for.

[37]                        So understood, the test in Grant is premised upon a practical reality of interactions between police and citizen, especially where the interaction concerns a criminal investigation. While words uttered by the police may hold a certain significance to trained and experienced police officers or to those trained in the law or otherwise already aware of their rights and how to exercise them, they may hold less significance, or different significance, to vulnerable individuals unfamiliar with their Charter rights. This particular instance of the imbalance of power between state and citizen that characterizes our criminal justice system is exacerbated by the psychological dynamics of police interrogation, where even repeated assurances that a detainee is free to leave may be disregarded, especially by innocent persons seeking to absolve themselves of any wrongdoing.

[38]                        None of this is undermined by the appellate caselaw relied upon by the Crown, which either predates Grant (e.g. R. v. Rajaratnam, 2006 ABCA 333, 397 A.R. 126), or confirms that all the circumstances of a case must be examined to determine whether a detention occurred (e.g. Seagull, at paras. 49-60; R. v. Van Wissen, 2018 MBCA 110, 367 C.C.C. (3d) 186). I therefore reject the Crown’s submission that a detention prima facie cannot arise where police state that the individual may decline to speak with them or may leave whenever a statement is presented. In this regard, my colleagues also place substantial weight upon such statements. Indeed, they treat them as all but determinative (as one might in considering the words used by police under the Moran framework), rather than focussing on the contextual factors that would affect the perception of the reasonable person in the accused’s shoes (as required by Grant and Le).

[39]                        To summarize: no single consideration, including a police statement to an individual that he or she is “not detained” or otherwise under any obligation to cooperate or may leave, is determinative of whether a detention has occurred. Where present, it is a single consideration among others for which a court should account in deciding whether a reasonable person in the shoes of the accused would feel obliged to cooperate. It does not automatically turn the tide, and may not turn the tide at all, where other factors point to a finding of detention.

[40]                        Indeed, Sgt. Eros’ statements to Mr. Lafrance[3] do not turn the tide here. While they militate against a finding of detention, they are outweighed by circumstances that support the opposite conclusion, namely that a reasonable person in his position would have felt compelled to comply and unfree to leave. For example:

•               Mr. Lafrance awoke to 11 police officers at his residence, with vans, firearms and bulletproof vests, ordering him to dress and get out of the house;

•               The police accompanied Mr. Lafrance while he searched for his cat;

•               Sgt. Eros approached Mr. Lafrance after he went outside, asked him to confirm his identity and told him that he wanted to ask him questions relating to Mr. Yasinski’s death;

•               The only practical means available to Mr. Lafrance for getting to the police station was for him to be driven, which he was in an unmarked police vehicle accompanied by two police officers;

•               At the station, the police brought Mr. Lafrance to an interview room at the back of the police station that was behind two sets of locked doors;

•               The police left Mr. Lafrance in the interview room for at least 17 minutes, having closed the door behind them, and did not inform him that the doors were unlocked; and

•               The police told Mr. Lafrance that he was in a secure environment, controlled his access to the outside of the interview room, and kept him under surveillance during the course of the interview, including escorting him to the bathroom.

(ii)         The Use of Physical Contact

[41]                        As is evident from the analysis in Le (at para. 50) and Grant (at paras. 50‑52), considering the use by police of physical contact with a subject extends to their physical proximity to a subject. Even where, strictly speaking, there is no physical contact, deliberate physical proximity within a small space can create an atmosphere that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that leaving is not possible (Le, at para. 50; Grant, at para. 50). This makes sense, since physical proximity can indicate the possibility of physical contact. And so, while nothing suggests that the police made any physical contact with Mr. Lafrance on March 19, that is not exhaustive of this consideration. For example, a reasonable person in Mr. Lafrance’s shoes might, particularly after he was escorted to the bathroom, view the investigating officers’ constant proximity as suggesting that any attempt to leave, at least on his own, would be met with physical resistance.

[42]                        All that said, and while the police chose to interview Mr. Lafrance in what Sgt. Eros described as the “secure environment” of an interview room, their conduct here is a far cry from Le, where the police officers intentionally positioned themselves in a way to block the exit from the backyard (para. 50). Neither the evidence here nor the trial judge’s findings suggest that the police sought to take advantage of the physical proximity in such a way. In my view, considerations of physical proximity alone would have little if any impact on whether a reasonable person in Mr. Lafrance’s position would feel free to decline to speak to police or to leave.

(iii)      The Presence of Others

[43]                        This is a significant consideration here. Except while he was left alone in the interview room and in the bathroom, Mr. Lafrance was in the presence of at least one police officer throughout his interaction with the police, from the moment they awoke him in his home. Initially, he was under the supervision of an armed police search team that executed the warrant and monitored him while he was in and out of the home. Following this, Sgt. Eros and S/Sgt. Zazulak were present throughout, from their initial encounter outside the home, to the ride to the police station, and the interview. These officers weighed approximately 220 lb. to 245 lb., respectively (while Mr. Lafrance weighed 130 lb.), and S/Sgt. Zazulak was armed and wearing a bulletproof vest. Their continued presence and supervision would tend to contribute to the perception of a reasonable person in Mr. Lafrance’s shoes that he or she was not free to decline to speak or to leave.

[44]                        My colleagues appear to understand this consideration, as it was stated in Le, as applying only to the presence of witnesses, as opposed to the police (para. 152). Putting aside that the police were witnesses here, I see no good reason to keep to such a narrow purview. The “presence of others” was not a novel consideration in Le. It is one of the factors listed in Grant to evaluate “[t]he nature of police conduct” (para. 44(2)(b) (emphasis added)). For that reason, the Court, in support of its finding of psychological detention in Grant, pointed to the presence of other police at the time of the encounter (paras. 49-52). The point is that all police conduct relevant to whether a reasonable person in Mr. Lafrance’s shoes would have understood himself or herself as free to leave must be considered. Indeed, that the witnesses were police, if anything, weighs more heavily in finding a detention than if they were mere bystanders.

(iv)        The Place and Duration of the Encounter

[45]                        The entirety of Mr. Lafrance’s encounter with the police spans several locations and various periods of time. In my view, considerations of place and time would lead a reasonable person in Mr. Lafrance’s shoes to believe he had to cooperate with the police.

[46]                        The initial early morning encounter occurred inside Mr. Lafrance’s home. Any police intrusion into a home “is reasonably experienced as more forceful, coercive and threatening than when similar state action occurs in public” (Le, at para. 51). This remains true, irrespective of whether the intrusion is authorized by warrant, although depending on the circumstances of the intrusion, its impact may be mitigated where, as here, police inform the occupant that they have a search warrant.

[47]                        Even where that happens, however, the mode of entry into the household, while authorized by law, may be reasonably perceived as intimidating. It is to my mind indisputable that this would have been so in the circumstances of this intrusion. No reasonable person in Mr. Lafrance’s shoes would have had all misgivings just melt away with the assurance that the 11 police officers who had just awoken him inside his home and ordered him out had first obtained a search warrant. Thus, the impact of a police intrusion into a home may be mitigated where they inform the occupant that they have a search warrant. But police and reviewing courts must also be alive to the possibility that the execution of a warrant at a residence — being a means by which the police exercises control of the home — can itself support the finding of a detention where it is also applied in such a manner as to take control of the person. This is precisely what occurred here: police ordered Mr. Lafrance to get dressed and leave, then monitored him as he made his way outside to a pre‑arranged encounter with a waiting Sgt. Eros.

[48]                        The encounter continued after Sgt. Eros took over and made the request for a statement, and during the ride to the police station. I note that, in concluding that Mr. Lafrance was not detained at that time, the trial judge considered that he had agreed to go to the detachment to allay suspicion. My colleagues do the same, stressing Mr. Lafrance’s subjective perceptions as “particularly significant” (para. 162). The test is principally objective (Le, at para. 114). Undue focus on an individual’s subjective perception detracts from the rationales underlying the objective test (para. 115). Therefore, rather than focusing on “what was in the accused’s mind at a particular moment in time”, the inquiry is into “how the police behaved and, considering the totality of the circumstances, how such behavi[our] would be reasonably perceived” (para. 116).

[49]                        This is not to suggest that police are to be taken as detaining an individual by giving them a ride to the police station. The question is whether a reasonable person in the passenger’s shoes would believe that he or she could cease cooperating by asking the police to stop the vehicle and leave; the answer will depend on all the circumstances of the case (Coughlan and Luther, at p. 291), including what has already transpired. And given what had already transpired in this case, a reasonable person in Mr. Lafrance’s position would not in my judgment have felt remotely free to do so.

[50]                        The encounter then persisted through a three‑and‑a‑half‑hour interview at the police station, in an interview room described by Sgt. Eros as a “secure environment”, accessible as I have already noted through two sets of locked doors. The “security” of that environment — comprising both the interview room and the surrounding facility through which it was accessed — would tend to affirm in the mind of someone in Mr. Lafrance’s position that he or she is not free to leave at will.

[51]                        In sum, this was a single, lengthy police encounter. While it spanned several locations, each of them have features — the overwhelming show of force in the intrusion into the home, the long ride to the police station and the secure environment for a lengthy interview — that, taken as a whole, support the view that someone in Mr. Lafrance’s position would reasonably have perceived that he or she could not leave (Le, at para. 66). This supports a finding of detention.

(c)           The Particular Circumstances of the Accused

[52]                        The final Grant factor requires a court to consider, where relevant, the individual’s “age[,] physical stature[,] minority status[, and] level of sophistication” (Grant, at para. 44(2)(c); Le, at para. 31(c)).

[53]                        While the trial judge acknowledged that Mr. Lafrance was young, Indigenous and had minimal police exposure at that time (para. 79), in my respectful view more was required to properly account for how the characteristics he quite rightly identified — Mr. Lafrance’s youth, his Indigenous background and his inexperience — might shape the perspective of the reasonable person in his shoes, imbued with those characteristics. These are not factors to be checked off a list; Grant requires more than a straightforward acknowledgement of their presence, but actual consideration of how these various characteristics might impact the reasonable view of the matter as held by someone in like circumstances. I turn now to doing just that.

(i)            Youth

[54]                        Mr. Lafrance’s youth — he was 19 years old — is a crucial consideration that I say, again respectfully, should have received more attention. A reasonable person’s perceptions are inevitably shaped by the knowledge and powers of discernment that comes with age and life experience (Le, at para. 122). Youth — even the youth of early adulthood — aggravates the power imbalance between the state and the individual, making it “more pronounced, evident and acute” (para. 122). It is simply unrealistic to suggest that a reasonable 19‑year‑old will, even in the presence of police statements to the contrary, feel anything but constrained to respond positively to the request to give a statement, following immediately upon the sort of police entry into his home that occurred here.

(ii)         Race

[55]                        This Court in Le emphasized that the objective analysis in Grant must be applied in a manner that accounts for the distinct experiences and particular knowledge of racialized communities in Canada:

     In Grant, this Court recognized how the legal standard on which a detention is measured is based on a reasonable person in like circumstances and that this norm needs to account for diverse realities. By expressly including the race of the accused as a potentially relevant consideration, this Court acknowledged that, based on distinct experiences and particular knowledge, various groups of people may have their own history with law enforcement and that this experience and knowledge could bear on whether and when a detention has reasonably occurred. Thus, to truly engage in the “realistic appraisal of the entire interaction”, as required in Grant (at para. 32), courts must appreciate that individuals in some communities may have different experiences and relationships with police than others and such may impact upon their reasonable perceptions of whether and when they are being detained. [para. 73]

[56]                        The question that trial judges must answer is “how a reasonable person of a similar racial background would perceive the interaction with the police” (Le, at para. 75). To answer this question, courts must take into consideration “the larger, historic and social context of race relations between the police and the various racial groups and individuals in our society” (Le, at para. 75). The reasonable person in an accused’s shoes is presumed to be aware of this (Le, at para. 75). Moreover, this consideration is to be undertaken with sensitivity and prudence. Even in the absence of testimony on the point, trial judges assessing whether a racialized person was detained must be alive to the potential significance of this consideration (Le, at paras. 98 and 106; R. v. Theriault, 2021 ONCA 517, 157 O.R. (3d) 241, at para. 143).

[57]                        As recognized by the trial judge, Mr. Lafrance is Indigenous. As such, he is a member of a population that continues to be disproportionally subjected to police encounters and overrepresented in the criminal justice system (R. v. Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, at paras. 58-65; R. v. Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433, at paras. 57-60; Le, at paras. 90-97 and 108). The assessment of whether an Indigenous person was detained must be mindful of “[g]enerations of systematic racism, discriminatory policies and practices directed at Indigenous people” and of the role of police in implementing these policies and practices (Statistics Canada, Perceptions of and experiences with police and the justice system among the Black and Indigenous populations in Canada (February 2022), at p. 12). This has fostered mistrust, confirmed by the finding of a February 2022 study that “[a] higher proportion of Indigenous people under 40 felt police were doing poorly at enforcing the laws, promptly responding to calls, ensuring the safety of citizens, and treating people fairly compared to the similarly aged non‑Indigenous, non‑visible minority population” (Statistics Canada, at p. 11). This finding applied equally to older Indigenous people (Statistics Canada, at p. 11).

[58]                        This consideration will often weigh in favour of finding a detention, but not invariably. A court cannot simply assume that all Indigenous people’s experiences with the police are Charter non‑compliant or otherwise oppressive. And not all Indigenous people will be vulnerable, at all or in the same way, when interacting with police (K. G. Watkins, “The Vulnerability of Aboriginal Suspects When Questioned by Police: Mitigating Risk and Maximizing the Reliability of Statement Evidence” (2016), 63 Crim. L.Q. 474, at p. 479). The point is not that Grant or Le leave no room for nuance in evaluating interactions between Indigenous people and the police; it is, rather, that trial judges must be alive to (1) “the relational aspect” between the police and Indigenous persons (Le, at para. 81), characterized as it has been by an overwhelming power imbalance and history of discrimination; and (2) the resulting possibility that their interactions would reasonably be perceived by Indigenous persons as depriving them of choice to cooperate.

[59]                        Taking the foregoing and the record of this case into account, it would appear that Mr. Lafrance’s Indigenous background played no significant role in shaping his perception of his obligation to cooperate with the police on March 19. But, to be clear, that is not the question. Again, the inquiry is objective, not grounded in his subjective impressions. The question, then, is whether the reasonable person in Mr. Lafrance’s position would understand his or her options as limited to cooperating by reason of an Indigenous background. On this slender record, and absent any evidence to the contrary regarding Mr. Lafrance’s circumstances, his Indigenous background is a factor that weighs somewhat in favour of detention, albeit not heavily. This accounts for what I have already described as the overrepresentation of Indigenous peoples in the criminal justice system, and the “relational aspect” of the interaction between Indigenous people and police that must always be borne in mind.

(iii)      Level of Sophistication

[60]                        The trial judge held that Mr. Lafrance was a “not unsophisticated” individual with minimal exposure to the police (paras. 79 and 81). He characterized Mr. Lafrance, a high school graduate who had studied power engineering, as intelligent. I see no palpable and overriding error in these findings.

[61]                        My point of respectful departure from the trial judge is in applying these findings to decide how a reasonable person in Mr. Lafrance’s position would perceive his options in his interactions with the police. “Sophistication”, without elaboration, may be an unhelpful ascription; here, the trial judge noted only that “[a]t best, the accused was naïve in deciding his participation would counter police suspicion” (para. 81), which tends to undermine, not explain, the ascription. “Intelligence”, while more precise, does not necessarily connote an understanding of legal rights, including the right to refuse to cooperate with the police. Mr. Lafrance, for example, had never before found himself in circumstances requiring him to know his rights (which, if anything, suggests a lack of sophistication in a crucial respect here).

[62]                        All told, the trial judge’s finding of Mr. Lafrance’s sophistication (or, more accurately, lack of unsophistication) does not undermine the case for finding a detention. Rather, his lack of experience with the police and unfamiliarity with his Charter rights bolsters it.

(4)         Conclusion Regarding the Encounter of March 19, 2015

[63]                        All three Grant factors — the circumstances giving rise to the encounter, the nature of the police conduct, and the particular characteristics or circumstances of the individual — weigh decisively here, on the facts of this case, in favour of finding that Mr. Lafrance was first detained when he, a young Indigenous man with minimal police exposure, was awoken in the early morning by the police inside his home, and commanded to get dressed and leave. He continued to be detained throughout the encounter, including outside the home, in the police van and in the interview room of the police station, all of which involved the near-continuous supervision and presence of the police, until the conclusion of his interview on March 19, and I so find.

[64]                        It follows that police were required to inform Mr. Lafrance of his s. 10(b) right to counsel and to afford him the opportunity of exercising it, and breached that right by failing to do so. My colleagues say that this conclusion means that the combination of an accused young person and the execution of a search warrant will always result in a finding of detention (para. 160). But that is not so; it is only where the police execute a warrant in a way that leads the reasonable person in the accused’s shoes to believe that, in the entirety of the circumstances, he or she is not free to leave, that a detention would arise. Such was the case here: given the overwhelming force in which a team of police officers arrived at Mr. Lafrance’s home, ordered him to get dressed and leave his home, and monitored his every movement, the officers should have recognized that a reasonable person in Mr. Lafrance’s shoes would feel obliged to comply with their demands and would conclude that he or she was not free to go. In such situations, the police should have informed him of his rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter. I will turn to the consequences of this breach below, after considering his encounter with police on April 7.

B.            April 7, 2015

[65]                        Mr. Lafrance says that he could not properly exercise his right to counsel under s. 10(b) on April 7, after he was arrested. Sgt. Eros, he says, should have allowed him to speak with his father so he could obtain his own lawyer and receive further legal advice.

[66]                        Citing Sinclair, the trial judge concluded that the Charter did not compel Sgt. Eros to accede to Mr. Lafrance’s request for a further consultation. The majority of the Court of Appeal, however, viewed Mr. Lafrance’s request to speak with his father as falling within what Sinclair described as a “change in circumstances” suggesting a significant alteration of the choice to be made by the accused. Mr. Lafrance’s request, said the majority, “show[ed] that [he] may not have understood the initial s. 10(b) advice he received from legal aid counsel [. . .], that he needed the opportunity to pose further questions of counsel and have those questions answered, and that the initial advice he received, viewed contextually, was no longer sufficient” (para. 53). Alternatively, the majority would have held that Mr. Lafrance’s case would “fall within an open category, one not expressly defined in Sinclair” (paras. 53 and 64).

[67]                        For the reasons that follow, I am closer to the Court of Appeal’s view of the matter. As I will explain, this matter falls within the “change in circumstances” category described in Sinclair. Given this conclusion, I need not address the Court of Appeal’s alternative position that this case falls within an open‑ended Sinclair category.

(1)         The Purpose of Section 10(b) and the Sinclair Framework

[68]                        In Sinclair, the accused was arrested for second‑degree murder, advised of his right to counsel and allowed two three‑minute conversations with a lawyer of his choice. He was then interviewed for five hours, during which time his repeated requests to have his lawyer present or to speak with him again were refused. Eventually, he confessed after the interviewing officer made him believe that police had found incriminating evidence confirming his involvement. The accused sought to have his confession excluded, alleging a breach of s. 10(b).

[69]                        This Court ruled his confession admissible. Section 10(b) does not confer the right to have a lawyer present during a police investigation. And, a single consultation with a lawyer is constitutionally sufficient, absent a change in circumstances or new developments that suggest that the choice faced by the accused has been “significantly altered, requiring further advice on the new situation, in order to fulfill the purpose of s. 10(b) of providing the accused with legal advice relevant to the choice of whether to cooperate with the police investigation or not” (Sinclair, at para. 65). Such a change in circumstances or new development is not demonstrated, the Court added, where police engage in “the common . . . tactic of gradually revealing (actual or fake) evidence to the detainee in order to demonstrate or exaggerate the strength of the case against [them]” (para. 60).

[70]                        This followed, said the Court, from the purpose of s. 10(b), being “to provide a detainee with an opportunity to obtain legal advice relevant to his legal situation” (Sinclair, at para. 24) or, more particularly, “to allow the detainee not only to be informed of his rights and obligations under the law but, equally if not more important, to obtain advice as to how to exercise those rights” (para. 26, citing Manninen, at pp. 1242-43). In the context of a custodial interrogation, the Court added that s. 10(b) seeks “to support the detainee’s right to choose whether to cooperate with the police investigation or not, by giving him access to legal advice on the situation [they are] facing” (para. 32).

[71]                        So understood, s. 10(b) reminds police of the constitutional limits to their interrogation of detainees. As this Court also recognized in Clarkson v. The Queen, 1986 CanLII 61 (SCC), [1986] 1 S.C.R. 383, at pp. 394-95, underlying s. 10(b) is a concern to mitigate the unfairness that prevails where the police understand the accused’s right to choose whether to speak to them, but the accused may lack that understanding. Key to realizing s. 10(b)’s promise to detainees of fair treatment is furnishing access to legal advice, since that advice is meant to level the playing field by ensuring, first of all, that detainees do understand their rights, “chief among which is [the] right to silence” (R. v. Hebert, 1990 CanLII 118 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151, at p. 176); and, secondly, that they understand how to exercise those rights (Sinclair, at para. 29). This includes knowing of “the benefits and drawbacks of cooperating with the police investigation, as well as strategies to resist cooperation should that be the detainee’s choice” (C.A. reasons, at para. 48).

[72]                        Properly understood and applied, Sinclair gives effect to s. 10(b) and achieves its purpose. It identifies within s. 10(b) an informational component (requiring police to advise detainees of their right to counsel), and an implementational component (requiring police to allow detainees to exercise their right to consult counsel), which implicitly includes “a duty on the police to hold off questioning until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to consult counsel” (para. 27). And, as just noted, Sinclair also recognized that the implementational component of s. 10(b) imposes upon police a further obligation: to provide a detainee with a reasonable opportunity to consult counsel again if a change in circumstances or a new development makes this necessary to fulfill s. 10(b)’s purpose (para. 53). Three non‑exhaustive categories of exceptional circumstances triggering this duty were identified (at paras. 49-52): (1) the police invite the accused to take part in non‑routine procedures that counsel would not consider at the time of the initial consultation; (2) there is a change in jeopardy that could affect the adequacy of the advice received during the initial consultation; and (3) there is reason to question the detainee’s understanding of his rights. It is that third category which the Court of Appeal thought applicable here. I agree.

[73]                        In Sinclair, this category was “broadly” stated as covering, inter alia, “circumstances indicating that the detainee may not have understood the initial s. 10(b) advice of his right to counsel”, which “impose on the police a duty to give him a further opportunity to talk to a lawyer” (para. 52). This raises the question of how such circumstances are to be identified ⸺ that is, what it means for a detainee to not understand “the initial s. 10(b) advice” such that a second legal consultation is necessary. I note, parenthetically, that the third category also covers a different type of potential s. 10(b) breach, i.e., where “the police undermine the legal advice that the detainee has received [in a way that] may have the effect of distorting or nullifying it” (para. 52; see R. v. Dussault, 2022 SCC 16, at para. 35). The Court’s recent judgment in Dussault comprehensively reviews the kind of police conduct that could be said to “undermine” the legal advice that a detainee receives (paras. 36-45).

[74]                        The caselaw reveals two general approaches to assessing detainees’ understanding of s. 10(b) advice. The first — narrower, relative to the second — tends to focus on the fact of the earlier consultation or, where applicable, on a detainee’s assertion of his or her right to silence (see, e.g., R. v. Pagé, 2018 QCCS 5553, at paras. 20-21 (CanLII); R. v. Smith, 2015 ABQB 624, at paras. 66-68 (CanLII); R. v. Ejigu, 2012 BCSC 1673, at para. 58 (CanLII); and R. v. Jongbloets, 2017 BCSC 740, at paras. 109-10 and 113 (CanLII)). The second approach inquires into “the overall context”, or “the situation ‘on the ground’” (R. v. A.R.M., 2011 ABCA 98, 599 A.R. 343, at paras. 25 and 40) that properly inform the reasonable perceptions of police of whether detainees understand their right to silence and how to exercise it (see, e.g., R. v. Laquette, 2021 MBQB 177, at para. 93 (CanLII): “Perhaps, in this case, the Applicant, because of her youth and inexperience in engaging with law enforcement, should have been afforded [a further consultation with legal counsel]” (emphasis added); R. v. Hunt, 2020 ONCJ 627, at para. 51 (CanLII): “In most cases, it can be inferred from the circumstances that the detainee understands what he or she has been told, but where there are circumstances where the detainee may not understand his or her [right to counsel], the police must take steps to facilitate that understanding [including] giving consideration to the detainee’s understanding and capacity to understand” (emphasis added); and R. v. Fedoseev, 2014 ABPC 192, 597 A.R. 1, at paras. 55-63).

[75]                        Bearing in mind that the third Sinclair category was “broadly” stated by this Court by reference to “circumstances” indicating that “the detainee may not have understood the initial s. 10(b) advice”, two points merit emphasizing (Sinclair, at para. 52). First, the inquiry is into circumstances, stated broadly. This connotes an examination not merely of whether the detainee consulted legal counsel, but of the entire context in which the police‑detainee interaction occurred (as in A.R.M.), including the circumstances of the detainee (as in Laquette and Hunt). Secondly, and therefore, an inquiry strictly into whether a detainee understood that he or she could remain silent is not sufficient. The issue, after all, is not merely whether the detainee was advised; the third category presumes that to have occurred. Section 10(b) requires much more than that (a point repeatedly stressed in Sinclair: see paras. 2, 24‑26, 28‑29, 32, 47‑48, 53, 57 and 65). Rather, it is that the detainee may not have understood the legal advice he or she received including, as the Court of Appeal correctly noted, whether and how to exercise the right to silence, which itself includes “the benefits and drawbacks of cooperating” and “strategies to resist cooperation” where that is the detainee’s choice.

[76]                        Such an approach is not only more faithful to Sinclair; it is also consistent with this Court’s direction in Grant that “[c]onstitutional guarantees such as ss. 9 and 10 should be interpreted in a ‘generous rather than . . . legalistic [way], aimed at fulfilling the purpose of the guarantee and securing for individuals the full benefit of the Charter’s protection’” (para. 16, citing R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., 1985 CanLII 69 (SCC), [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, at p. 344). I have already stressed that s. 10(b)’s purpose is not achieved merely by allowing the detainee an opportunity to be advised of the right to silence, but also extends to advice regarding how to exercise that right in the face of police interrogation. And coupled with Sinclair’s concern for the circumstances of the detention, which I have explained include the circumstances of the detainee, it follows that the purposive and generous understanding of s. 10(b) mandated by Grant recognizes that the exercise by accused persons of that right depends on access to legal advice regarding “the [particular] situation [they are] facing”, conveyed in a manner that they understand (Sinclair, at para. 32 (emphasis added)).

[77]                        Absent that understanding, the work done by our jurisprudence (notably, in Grant and Le) on detention under s. 9 to account for and mitigate the power imbalance between the state and a detainee would be undone by an impoverished understanding of s. 10(b)’s protections, inconsistent with Sinclair itself and corrosive of the liberty of the subject. A purposive and generous understanding of s. 10(b) and, by extension, of the third Sinclair category, also reflects that practical reality of police‑citizen interactions of which I have already spoken, and which obtains a fortiori in circumstances of arrest or detention: the detainee is in a position of disadvantage relative to the state (V. A. MacDonnell, “R v Sinclair: Balancing Individual Rights and Societal Interests Outside of Section 1 of the Charter” (2012), 38 Queen’s L.J. 137, at p. 156). This disadvantage is no small matter, particularly given that the police may employ tactics such as lying during an interrogation. It is only by ensuring that detainees obtain legal advice that accounts for the particular situation they face, conveyed in a manner they can understand, that s. 10(b) can meaningfully redress the imbalance of power between the state (whose agents know the detainee’s rights) and the detainee (who may not).

[78]                        My colleagues say it is inaccurate to describe s. 10(b)’s purpose as being “to mitigate the imbalance between the individual and the state” (para. 168). With respect, this proposition is uncontroversial. Despite my colleagues’ view to the contrary, it follows from this Court’s statement in R. v. Willier, 2010 SCC 37, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 429, at para. 28, that “s. 10(b) provides detainees with an opportunity to contact counsel in circumstances where they are deprived of liberty and in the control of the state, and thus vulnerable to the exercise of its power and in a position of legal jeopardy”, and that “[t]he purpose of s. 10(b) is to provide detainees an opportunity to mitigate this legal disadvantage”. While my colleagues claim that Sinclair, at paras. 30‑31, rejects this view, this is, again said respectfully, a misreading of Sinclair. At issue in those passages was not whether s. 10(b)’s purpose is to cure that power imbalance, but how it does so. The dissenters LeBel and Fish JJ. maintained that it does so by conferring a continuing right to counsel throughout the accused’s police interview (paras. 30 and 154). The majority, however, held that it does so by conferring a right to consult counsel “to obtain information and advice immediately upon detention” (para. 31) in order to fulfill “the purpose of s. 10(b) . . . to support the detainee’s right to choose whether to cooperate with the police investigation or not, by giving [them] access to legal advice on the situation he is facing” (para. 32 (emphasis added)).

[79]                        The degree of imbalance between police and detainee will of course vary from case to case, depending on the particular circumstances of the detainees themselves. Specific characteristics of individual detainees (described as “vulnerabilities” in the context of police interrogation) can influence the course of custodial interviews. Investigating officers and reviewing courts must be alive to the possibility that these vulnerabilities, which may relate to gender, youth, age, race, mental health, language comprehension, cognitive capacity or other considerations, coupled with developments that may occur in the course of police interrogation, will have rendered a detainee’s initial legal advice inadequate, impairing his or her ability to make an informed choice about whether to cooperate with the police. In such situations, Sinclair requires that an accused is entitled to an additional consultation to even the playing field.

(2)         The Need for a Second Consultation on April 7, 2015

[80]                        With the foregoing in mind, I turn now to consider whether the police breached Mr. Lafrance’s s. 10(b) right to counsel by refusing to allow him to seek a second consultation with a lawyer.

[81]                        The police fulfilled the informational component of s. 10(b). Having arrested Mr. Lafrance for murder, they told him of the reason for his arrest, and of his right to silence. Likewise, the police also, initially at least, satisfied the implementational component: upon arrival at the police station, Mr. Lafrance was taken to a telephone room and was able to speak with a lawyer from Legal Aid. Sgt. Eros deferred starting the interview until Mr. Lafrance confirmed that he had received and understood the advice given to him by Legal Aid.

[82]                        The question therefore arises whether any of the exceptions in Sinclair applied to require the police to allow Mr. Lafrance another opportunity to consult with counsel. I do not agree with Mr. Lafrance that his circumstances would fit into any of the three Sinclair categories of exceptional circumstances that require an additional consultation. The first category — where police invite the accused to take part in non‑routine procedures that counsel would not consider at the time of the initial consultation — does not apply, because the police here did not employ any new or unusual investigative techniques. Likewise, the second category — a change in jeopardy which could affect the adequacy of the advice received during the initial to the actual situation — is inapplicable because there was no change in jeopardy during the interview. Mr. Lafrance had been informed that he was accused of murder and that remained true at all times during the interview on April 7.

[83]                        The difficulty arises, however, from Mr. Lafrance’s request in the course of the police interview to speak with his father because that was his “only chance of getting a lawyer”. The Crown argues that there is no constitutional right to speak to a detainee’s father, but that is not a fair characterization of Mr. Lafrance’s request, which drew an explicit connection between talking to his father and talking to a lawyer:

Q. Alright so what happens Nigel?

A. Well –.

Q. What – what went on?

A. Well I would – ah I want to talk to my dad before I continue.

Q. Ok wh – why do you say that?

A. Cause well he’s – well he’s my only chance of getting a lawyer and I just – I don’t know. [Emphasis added.]

 

(A.R., vol. V, at p. 137)

It is also inaccurate to describe Mr. Lafrance, as the Crown and trial judge do, as simply requesting that a lawyer be present with him during the interview. He clarified to Sgt. Eros that what he really sought was an opportunity to get, and speak to, a lawyer:

A. Well no they told me – they told me to get a lawyer before I continue talking.

Q. Ok what do you mean by told you to get a lawyer?

A. Like someone that can come down and sit with me.

Q. Ok.

A. Instead of just over the phone.

Q. There’s a person that ah you know what – and the way that that kinda goes ah – I won’t say it’s, it’s bad advice but it’s maybe miss – a little bit miss as – miss ah – interrupted. Um there’s not any time or any process during our interview –.

A. Um?

Q. Where we’re gonna have a lawyer sitting in the room with us.

A. No, no I – I mean, no mean like so –.

Q. Ok.

A. Like for me to sit down with them personally.

Q. Ok.

A. To talk to. [Emphasis added.]

 

(A.R., vol. V, at p. 139)

[84]                        Sgt. Eros then questioned Mr. Lafrance about his conversation with Legal Aid. While Mr. Lafrance acknowledged that he was told that he did not have to say anything, there were also clear signs that either the legal advice he obtained was incorrect, or he did not understand how his s. 10(b) rights applied to his current circumstances. Mr. Lafrance explained to Sgt. Eros that the advice he obtained from Legal Aid was to “get a lawyer before [he] continue talking” and get “someone that can come down and sit with [him]” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 139) — indicating either that Mr. Lafrance had incorrectly interpreted the advice he received or, as Sgt. Eros hinted at, that he had received “bad advice”.

[85]                        This represents, to my mind, a critical moment in Mr. Lafrance’s encounter with the police. Faced with a detainee who was obviously ignorant as to his rights, Sgt. Eros had a choice: to press ahead with the interview, whether despite or because of that ignorance; or, to allow the subject an opportunity to clarify his rights and how to exercise them in his circumstances. Sgt. Eros chose the former course; the Constitution demanded the latter.

[86]                        There was ample reason here to question Mr. Lafrance’s understanding of his s. 10(b) right, bringing his circumstances within the third Sinclair category. While it is true that general confusion or a “nee[d for] help” is not a ground for further consultation with counsel (Sinclair, at para. 55), Mr. Lafrance was not, as my colleagues say, experiencing “mere confusion” or “discomfort” (paras. 177-83 (emphasis deleted)). To explain, and as my colleagues acknowledge, a “changed circumstance” can arise “[w]hen there is reason to question the detainee’s understanding of his s. 10(b) right” (para. 172). That is this case. His confusion was an “objective indicat[or] that renewed legal consultation was required to permit him to make a meaningful choice as to whether to cooperate with the police investigation or refuse to do so” (Sinclair, at para. 55). And this is because the information to which he had a right under s. 10(b) had not been conveyed, either at all or in a manner he understood (para. 52).

[87]                        The concern that should reasonably have arisen in the mind of the investigating officer that Mr. Lafrance may not have understood his rights and how to exercise them is affirmed, if not heightened, when considered in light of Mr. Lafrance’s particular characteristics. It is entirely plausible that a 19‑year‑old with no previous experience of detention or custodial interviews might have difficulty understanding his or her rights, not ever having had to exercise them or even speak with a lawyer before. While the trial judge found him “not unsophisticated”, as I have already explained he was obviously unsophisticated in ways that matter here. Finally, and while, as I have explained, it is not clear that this was a present factor in this case, in view of Mr. Lafrance’s Indigenous heritage I note that investigating officers and reviewing courts should be alive to the pronounced power imbalance that arises from the unique, historical vulnerability of Indigenous people in their encounters with the criminal justice system (Watkins, at pp. 493-95). All these considerations — none of which are taken into consideration by my colleagues — further support the conclusion that Mr. Lafrance’s circumstances fall within the third Sinclair category.

(3)         Conclusion on Breach of Section 10(b) on April 7, 2015

[88]                        The police breached Mr. Lafrance’s s. 10(b) right to counsel by refusing to provide another opportunity to consult with a lawyer despite there being reason to conclude that he had not understood his s. 10(b) advice, even after having spoken with Legal Aid. I now turn to the consequences that follow from this breach and from the March 19 breach of Mr. Lafrance’s s. 10(b) right.

C.            Section 24(2) of the Charter

[89]                        Section 24(2) of the Charter is remedial: its purpose is to uphold Charter rights by providing effective remedies to those whose rights have been breached (R. v. 974649 Ontario Inc., 2001 SCC 81, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 575, at paras. 19 and 21). And its text is categorical: where evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed a Charter right or freedom, that evidence shall be excluded if it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances, its admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute (Le, at para. 139). The standpoint to be adopted throughout is, therefore, that of the administration of justice. As this Court emphasized in Le:

     Where the state seeks to benefit from the evidentiary fruits of Charter‑offending conduct, our focus must be directed not to the impact of state misconduct upon the criminal trial, but upon the administration of justice. Courts must also bear in mind that the fact of a Charter breach signifies, in and of itself, injustice, and a consequent diminishment of administration of justice. What courts are mandated by s. 24(2) to consider is whether the admission of evidence risks doing further damage by diminishing the reputation of the administration of justice — such that, for example, reasonable members of Canadian society might wonder whether courts take individual rights and freedoms from police misconduct seriously. We endorse this Court’s caution in Grant, at para. 68, that, while the exclusion of evidence “may provoke immediate criticism”, our focus is on “the overall repute of the justice system, viewed in the long term” by a reasonable person, informed of all relevant circumstances and of the importance of Charter rights. [Emphasis in original; para. 140.]

[90]                        Would, then, allowing the Crown to rely on the evidence obtained on March 19 and April 7 in breach of Mr. Lafrance’s Charter rights bring the administration of justice into disrepute? Deciding this entails considering and balancing the three lines of inquiry identified in Grant: (1) the seriousness of the Charter‑infringing conduct; (2) the impact on the Charter‑protected interests of the accused; and (3) society’s interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits (para. 71; Le, at paras. 139-42; R. v. Tim, 2022 SCC 12, at para. 74). While the first two lines of inquiry typically work in tandem, it is not necessary that both of them support exclusion in order for a court to determine that admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute (Le, at para. 141). As the Court said in Le, “[i]t is the sum, and not the average, of those first two lines of inquiry that determines the pull towards exclusion” (para. 141). In other words, it is the cumulative weight of the first two lines of inquiry that trial judges must consider and balance against the third line of inquiry when assessing whether evidence should be excluded. That is why the third line — which typically pulls towards a finding that admission would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute — will seldom tip the scale in favour of admissibility when the two first lines, taken together, make a strong case for exclusion (Le, at para. 142; R. v. Paterson, 2017 SCC 15, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 202, at para. 56).

[91]                        An analysis pursuant to s. 24(2) — which is an exercise in judicial discretion by the trial judge — attracts deference as to the supporting findings of fact (Grant, at paras. 43 and 86). But the application of the law to the facts is a question of law (Grant, para. 43). Further, an appellate court owes no deference where it disagrees with the trial judge’s conclusions on the Charter breaches (Le, at para. 138; Grant, at para. 129; Paterson, at para. 42).

[92]                        Here, the trial judge did not consider s. 24(2), given his conclusion that the police did not breach Mr. Lafrance’s Charter rights. Instead, it was the Court of Appeal that considered the Grant factors and held that admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. This Court does not lack jurisdiction to consider alleged errors in the s. 24(2) analysis of the Court of Appeal (R. v. Reilly, 2021 SCC 38). But we must bear in mind that this Court and the Court of Appeal are, essentially, on identical footing for an analysis under s. 24(2), neither court having had the benefit of observing the witnesses or hearing testimony first‑hand. I will therefore conduct a fresh s. 24(2) analysis. As I will explain, however, I largely agree with the Court of Appeal’s analysis.

(1)         Seriousness of the Charter‑Infringing Conduct

[93]                        The first Grant inquiry speaks to the importance of courts dissociating themselves from evidence obtained as a result of police failure to meet Charter standards, because of its negative impact on the reputation of the administration of justice (Le, at para. 143). In deciding whether this is necessary, they must “situate that conduct on a scale of culpability” (Paterson, at para. 43; see also Tim, at para. 82). Inadvertent or minor violations tend only to minimally undermine public confidence in the rule of law and, consequently, bear only slightly upon the reputation of the administration of justice, while evidence obtained “through a wilful or reckless disregard of Charter rights will inevitably have a negative effect on the public confidence in the rule of law” (Paterson, at para. 43; Grant, at para. 74; see also Le, at para. 143; R. v. Harrison, 2009 SCC 34, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 494, at para. 22). And evidence obtained by police negligence in meeting Charter standards does not qualify as a “good faith” error, but instead supports a conclusion that a court should dissociate itself from such evidence (Le, at para. 143; Tim, at para. 85).

[94]                        The Court of Appeal described the denial of the right to counsel on March 19 and April 7 as “particularly serious given the grave nature of the offence under investigation, the potential consequences of conviction on [Mr. Lafrance] and his particular vulnerability given his young age and circumstances in life” (para. 79). While it did not believe that these breaches “occurred through a willful or reckless disregard of Charter rights”, the Court of Appeal nevertheless held that the Charter‑infringing conduct remained serious (para. 80).

[95]                        I agree entirely. That the Charter infringing conduct here was not reckless does not mean that police acted in “good faith” or that the absence of recklessness is a mitigating factor (Le, at para. 143; Paterson, at para. 44; Harrison, at para. 25; R. v. Buhay, 2003 SCC 30, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 631, at para. 59). On both March 19 and April 7, the police conduct resulted in serious breaches of Mr. Lafrance’s Charter rights. This favours a finding that admission of the resulting evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

(2)         Impact of the Breaches on the Charter‑Protected Interests of the Accused

[96]                        The second Grant inquiry requires the Court to consider whether, from the standpoint of society’s interest in respect for Charter rights, the admission of evidence tainted by the Charter breach would bring the administration of justice into disrepute (Le, at para. 151). Like the first inquiry, this inquiry is into the degree of seriousness. As a general rule, “[t]he more serious the impact on the accused’s protected interests, the greater the risk that admission of the evidence may signal to the public that Charter rights, however high‑sounding, are of little actual avail to the citizen, breeding public cynicism and bringing the administration of justice into disrepute” (Grant, at para. 76; Le, at para. 151).

[97]                        This case involved two breaches of s. 10(b). While not determinative, I am alive to the Court’s description of the right guaranteed by s. 10(b) as “the single most important organizing principle in criminal law” (R. v. P. (M.B.), 1994 CanLII 125 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 555, at p. 577). Any breach of this provision “undermines the detainee’s right to make a meaningful and informed choice whether to speak, the related right to silence, and, most fundamentally, the protection against testimonial self‑incrimination” (Grant, at para. 95). As the Court of Appeal’s analysis makes plain, those particular consequences were of a serious nature here: “[Mr. Lafrance] was led to confess to killing a person without having an opportunity for a thorough, reflective discussion with a lawyer fully apprised of his jeopardy” (para. 82). I see no basis to diverge from the Court of Appeal’s assessment that this had “a serious impact” on Mr. Lafrance’s Charter rights (para. 82). The second line of Grant supports the view that admitting this evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

(3)         Society’s Interest in the Adjudication for the Case on its Merits

[98]                        The third Grant line is concerned with the societal interest in “an adjudication on the merits”, coupled with a focus on the impact of state misconduct upon the reputation of the administration of justice (Le, at para. 158). Society’s interest in an adjudication of the case on its merits typically pulls towards a finding that admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute, but not all considerations will pull in this direction (Le, at paras. 142 and 158). As the Court explained in Le:

While this inquiry is concerned with the societal interest in “an adjudication on the merits” (Grant, at para. 85), the focus, as we have already explained, must be upon the impact of state misconduct upon the reputation of the administration of justice. While disrepute may result from the exclusion of relevant and reliable evidence (Grant, at para. 81), so too might it result from admitting evidence that deprives the accused of a fair hearing or that amounts to “judicial condonation of unacceptable conduct by the investigatory and prosecutorial agencies” ([R. v.] Collins[, 1987 CanLII 84 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265], at p. 281). An “adjudication on the merits”, in a rule of law state, presupposes an adjudication grounded in legality and respect for longstanding constitutional norms. [para. 158]

[99]                        The Court of Appeal did not explicitly state whether this line of inquiry favours admission or exclusion, but the majority’s reasons tend to suggest that it only slightly favours admission (paras. 83-84). While the evidence appeared prima facie reliable given its nature as a confession, it was “largely extraneous to the core of the Crown’s case”, given that Mr. Lafrance confessed only to having caused Mr. Yasinski’s death and not to having planned or intended to kill him (para. 84). The remaining evidence, the majority observed, did not leave the Crown without a case on either manslaughter or second degree murder.

[100]                     I agree with what I understand to be the Court of Appeal’s conclusion that the third Grant line supports admission, but not heavily so. The evidence relates to a serious criminal offence, but society’s interests are not strongly affected given the other evidence available to the Crown on re‑trial. 

(4)         Admission of the Evidence Would Bring the Administration of Justice Into Disrepute

[101]                     Taken together, the three Grant lines of inquiry confirm that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. These were two serious breaches with a correspondingly significant impact on the s. 10(b) rights of Mr. Lafrance. The first and second lines of inquiry therefore present a strong case for exclusion of the evidence. On the other hand, society’s interest favours admission of the evidence, but not strongly. Taken cumulatively, the strength of the first two lines of inquiry overwhelms the moderate impact on society’s interest in the truth‑seeking function of the criminal trial process. 

[102]                     It follows that the evidence obtained as a result of the breaches of Mr. Lafrance’s Charter rights on March 19 and April 7 must be excluded.

V.           Conclusion

[103]                     I would dismiss the appeal. 

 

The reasons of Wagner C.J. and Moldaver, Côté and Rowe JJ. were delivered by

 

                  Côté and Rowe JJ. —

I.               Introduction

[104]                     This case involves what should be a straightforward application of this Court’s jurisprudence under ss. 9 (the right against arbitrary detention), 10(b) (the right to retain and instruct counsel on detention) and 24(2) (exclusion of unconstitutionally obtained evidence when its admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The majority of this Court begins its analysis by acknowledging this, but proceeds to adopt interpretations of those sections that depart from that jurisprudence. We cannot agree with that approach and the proposed outcome of this case.

II.            Facts and Decisions Below

[105]                     We do not find it necessary to repeat all the facts and issues as set out by our colleagues, but we wish to comment briefly on the findings of the trial judge and the analysis applied to those findings by the Court of Appeal.

[106]                     The respondent, Nigel Vernon Lafrance, an Indigenous man who was 19 years old at the time, was linked to the killing of Anthony Yasinski, his drug dealer, on March 17, 2015. Mr. Lafrance was the last person Mr. Yasinski communicated with on his cellphone. Therefore, police quickly identified Mr. Lafrance as a person of interest.

[107]                     Police obtained a search warrant for Mr. Lafrance’s residence and, while executing it on March 19, 2015, asked him if he would provide a statement at the police station. Mr. Lafrance was informed that his participation was voluntary and that he did not have to provide a statement. Nonetheless, he chose to do so and accompanied police officers to the station where he was interviewed by Sgt. Eros. He was not informed of his s. 10(b) rights at this interview.

[108]                     Almost three weeks later on April 7, 2015, Mr. Lafrance was arrested for the murder of the victim and interviewed at the police station again. When Mr. Lafrance arrived at the RCMP detachment, he was supplied with telephone books and a telephone number for Legal Aid Alberta. Mr. Lafrance spoke to a lawyer for approximately 15 minutes. After that conversation, an officer asked whether Mr. Lafrance understood the advice, to which he responded “yes”. The officer asked, then, if the lawyer would be attending the RCMP detachment, to which he responded “no” (see trial reasons, 2017 ABQB 746, 399 C.R.R. (2d) 184, at para. 124; R.F., at para. 7 (emphasis added)).

[109]                     The questioning did not begin until after Sgt. Eros was informed that Mr. Lafrance had consulted counsel. During the interview, five and a half hours after speaking with Legal Aid, Mr. Lafrance asked to call his father who, according to him, would be able to help him get a lawyer to come to the station. Police refused that request on the basis that he had already spoken to a lawyer. Mr. Lafrance subsequently confessed to the killing.

[110]                     At trial, Mr. Lafrance challenged the admission of the evidence obtained as a result of the March 19, 2015 statement and the April 7, 2015 statement, confession and evidence obtained as a result.

[111]                     The trial judge found that there were no breaches of Mr. Lafrance’s s. 10(b) or other Charter rights. Regarding the March 19, 2015 interview, the trial judge found Mr. Lafrance was not detained within the meaning of ss. 9 and 10(b). Police repeated several times that he could leave whenever he liked, and he understood these statements. Any statement to the contrary was not credible as it was belied by his “at ease” and “cooperative” manner in the interview (para. 73). Mr. Lafrance was “naïve”, but “not unsophisticated” (para. 81). In fact, the trial judge found that Mr. Lafrance tactically participated in the interview because he believed this could counter police suspicion.

[112]                     Further, the trial judge found that police properly implemented Mr. Lafrance’s s. 10(b) rights on April 7, 2015. Mr. Lafrance was not entitled in law to a further consultation with a lawyer after his conversation with Legal Aid. The trial judge found that none of the circumstances that would require a further consultation under R. v. Sinclair, 2010 SCC 35, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 310, arose in this case.

[113]                     The trial judge commented that even assuming there was a breach of s. 10(b) on March 19, 2015, its effect on the admissibility of evidence had to be considered. He found that since the Crown did not seek to introduce any evidence or the statement obtained on March 19, 2015, the issue of exclusion of this evidence under s. 24(2) was moot. The trial judge also found an insufficient causal, temporal or contextual connection between the March 19, 2015 statement and the April 7, 2015 statement such that any breach on March 19, 2015, did not taint the confession or other evidence obtained as a result of the April 7, 2015 interrogation. In reaching this conclusion, the trial judge relied on Mr. Lafrance’s own testimony that the March 19, 2015 statement “had nothing to do with” him providing the April 7, 2015 statement (para. 99).

[114]                     Consequently, the trial judge did not exclude any evidence and dismissed Mr. Lafrance’s Charter application. Mr. Lafrance was convicted by a jury of second degree murder.

[115]                     Mr. Lafrance appealed his conviction based in part on the s. 10(b) Charter rulings. The majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal found the trial judge erred in concluding there were no s. 10(b) Charter breaches (2021 ABCA 51, 20 Alta. L.R. (7th) 211). The majority stated that the trial judge did not appreciate the stage of the police investigation and undervalued Mr. Lafrance’s perceptions as a young Indigenous man and, therefore, erred in his analysis of whether there was a detention on March 19, 2015. The majority concluded that he was detained and, accordingly, should have been provided with his s. 10(b) rights.

[116]                     As for April 7, 2015, Mr. Lafrance was confused by the Legal Aid lawyer’s advice. The majority of the Court of Appeal concluded that a second consultation was required under Sinclair because the advice was insufficient or, arguably, as a result of new procedures. It also concluded that even if no category expressly described in Sinclair applied, a new consultation was necessary to fulfill the purpose of s. 10(b). Failure to provide Mr. Lafrance with a further consultation was a s. 10(b) breach. The majority of the Court of Appeal therefore allowed the appeal, held that the evidence obtained as a result of the March 19, 2015 statement and the April 7, 2015 statement be excluded and ordered a new trial.

[117]                     Wakeling J.A., in dissent, concluded that the trial judge did not commit any errors and there were no s. 10(b) breaches. Regarding March 19, 2015, he was of the view that there was no detention because the police told Mr. Lafrance several times that he was free to leave. Absent exceptional circumstances, which did not arise, that should be a bright line test that is determinative of detention. With regard to April 7, 2015, Mr. Lafrance received and understood the Legal Aid lawyer’s advice. He had no right to talk to his father or to further consult a lawyer. Wakeling J.A. would have dismissed the appeal.

III.         Analysis

[118]                     We disagree with the majority on three key issues. First, we are of the view that Mr. Lafrance was not detained within the meaning of s. 10(b) of the Charter on March 19, 2015. Second, we conclude that Mr. Lafrance was not entitled to a second consultation with counsel under s. 10(b) during the April 7, 2015 interrogation. Third, if Mr. Lafrance was detained on March 19, 2015, there is an insufficient link between the resulting Charter breach and the evidence relating to the April 7, 2015 interrogation that he sought to exclude under s. 24(2).

A.           Mr. Lafrance Was Not Detained Within the Meaning of Sections 9 and 10(b) of the Charter on March 19, 2015

[119]                     We are of the view that Mr. Lafrance was neither psychologically nor physically detained by police on March 19, 2015. Our disagreement with the majority turns on three keys points.

[120]                     First, while the majority states that the trial judge’s findings of fact are entitled to deference (at para. 23), it then goes on to substitute its own view of the evidence for that of the trial judge. The majority pays scant attention to the trial judge’s findings as to the interactions between police and Mr. Lafrance. Further, the evidence that the majority relies on for its findings that the police engaged in coercive behaviour — except as necessary for the proper execution of the search warrant — was rejected by the trial judge. In our view, a deferential approach leads to the conclusion that police did not engage in coercive behaviour toward Mr. Lafrance, but rather acted in a professional, non-confrontational manner on March 19, 2015.

[121]                     Second, we consider that the majority overemphasizes the perspective of a reasonable person in the particular circumstances of the accused. This approach provides little to no guidance to police in determining whether they have psychologically detained someone in carrying out their regular duties. It risks turning every common police encounter into a detention and creating situations where police are unable to control whether they breach Charter rights. For example, what reasons for the detention should the police provide to an individual, as required by s. 10(a), where they have no intention to detain him or her, but a reasonable person may nonetheless conclude a detention exists? How can the police avoid infringing the right under s. 9 against arbitrary detention when they are seeking to obtain information? It does a disservice to the administration of justice if we put police in a “Catch‑22” situation regarding psychological detention when they want to put questions to an individual.

[122]                     Third, we accord greater weight than does the majority to the police officers’ testimony that they made clear to Mr. Lafrance that he did not need to speak to them and was free to leave. We agree with the majority that a finding of detention is not precluded by such statements by police. However, the interaction between police and the individual must be considered in light of all relevant circumstances. Thus, coercive behaviour or accusatory questioning may negate police assurances that the individual need not speak to them and is free to go.

[123]                     But police statements to such effect are not merely “a single consideration among others”, as the majority suggests (para. 39). In our view, as the New Brunswick Court of Appeal stated in R. v. Way, 2011 NBCA 92, 377 N.B.R. (2d) 25, “detention will certainly be much more difficult to establish when such information has been genuinely provided” (para. 40). This is consistent with the role of unambiguous police statements that an individual is free to leave as contemplated by this Court in R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, at paras. 32 and 39.

[124]                     Our position is supported by numerous cases decided since Grant. The vast majority of decisions applying the Grant framework have held that individuals are not detained within the meaning of s. 9 or s. 10(b) of the Charter where they are unambiguously informed by police that they are free to go (see R. v. Todd, 2019 SKCA 36, [2019] 9 W.W.R. 207, at paras. 63‑69; R. v. Tran, 2010 ABCA 211, 482 A.R. 357, at paras. 25‑30; R. v. Schrenk, 2010 MBCA 38, 255 Man. R. (2d) 12, at para. 56; R. v. Hermkens & Moran, 2021 ABQB 885, at paras. 223‑34 (CanLII); R. v. Heppner, 2017 BCSC 894, at paras. 125 and 127 (CanLII); R. v. Roach, 2012 CanLII 6834 (NL SC), 2012 NLTD(G) 21, 319 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 231, at paras. 44‑45; R. v. Bristol, 2011 ABQB 73, at paras. 22‑23 (CanLII); R. v. Bucknell, 2021 BCPC 308, at paras. 99‑109 (CanLII); R. v. Giulioni, 2011 NLTD(G) 117, 313 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 220, at para. 29; R. v. Wheeler, 2010 YKTC 7, at para. 11 (CanLII); R. v. Rodh, 2010 SKPC 150, 364 Sask. R. 96, at para. 25). Consequently, unambiguous police statements that an individual is under no obligation to comply should weigh heavily against a finding of psychological detention, absent police conduct undermining this message (see R. v. Jackman, 2011 NLTD 116 (CanLII), 2011 NLTD(G) 116, 313 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 203, at paras. 42‑43).

[125]                     This is not to say that statements by police that the individual is free to go are “all but determinative” or that they justify turning the focus away from contextual factors, as the majority suggests in describing our position (para. 38). We acknowledge that the particular circumstances of the individual are pertinent in determining whether a reasonable person could consider that police by their conduct have undermined such statements. A person subject to accusatory questioning or coercive behaviour could reasonably feel detained by police regardless of statements to the contrary. The threshold may be lower for vulnerable individuals who are unfamiliar with their Charter rights. This is particularly true in cases of “intensive interrogation” (S. Penney, “Police Questioning in the Charter Era: Adjudicative versus Regulatory Rule‑making and the Problem of False Confessions” (2012), 57 S.C.L.R. (2d) 263, at p. 287 (emphasis added)).

[126]                     None of these concerns apply here. Although Mr. Lafrance is a young, Indigenous person with no experience akin to that on March 19, 2015, the police did not undermine their statements that he was free to go and under no obligation to cooperate. In dealing with Mr. Lafrance, police repeatedly reminded him that he was under no obligation to cooperate and could leave at any time; they also ensured that he understood his Charter right to silence at the beginning of the interview of March 19, 2015. Mr. Lafrance was eager to cooperate in order to allay suspicion.

[127]                     Applying the Grant framework, we conclude that Mr. Lafrance was not psychologically or otherwise detained at any point during his dealings with the police on March 19, 2015; thus, there was no requirement that he be advised by police of his right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter.

(1)         Circumstances Giving Rise to the Encounter

[128]                     According to the majority, “little consideration is given to the possibility that [the facts of the initial police encounter] gave rise to a detention” (para. 33). In the majority’s view, the overwhelming force manifested by police in the execution of the search warrant of the residence, combined with Mr. Lafrance’s personal characteristics, are determinative (para. 51).

[129]                     But the majority’s critique is unfounded, as the trial judge did consider the context in which police first interacted with Mr. Lafrance and its relevance to whether or not he was detained. The trial judge explained that the encounter began when police awoke Mr. Lafrance in the course of executing the search warrant, at para. 37:

Before encountering Sgt. Eros, Mr. Lafrance had been awakened by three police officers executing the search warrant. [Mr.] Lafrance was told he could not remain in the home while the search warrant was being executed. This was standard police practice and applied to all residence occupants. Outside the residence [Mr.] Lafrance, in the vicinity of police, retrieved his cat which had escaped from inside the residence. Sergeant Eros approached [Mr.] Lafrance in the garage area. After confirming [Mr.] Lafrance’s identity they had a brief conversation concerning the stabbing nearby. Sergeant Eros told [Mr.] Lafrance he wanted to speak with him about his involvement in an incident that had occurred down the road.

Indeed, the brief remarks of the trial judge on the initial encounter, read in context, indicate that the search warrant was executed professionally and disclosed no signs of unnecessary coercion. With respect, the majority’s assertion concerning “the overwhelming show of force in the intrusion into the home” (para. 51) plainly contradicts the trial judge’s assessment of the initial encounter.

[130]                     After verifying Mr. Lafrance’s identity, “Sergeant Eros testified he asked whether [Mr.] Lafrance would be willing to provide a voluntary statement. Sergeant Eros explained that [Mr.] Lafrance was free to leave, and that it was up to him to decide whether he would accompany Sgt. Eros or make a statement” (trial reasons, at para. 38). At that point, police were only “in the preliminary stages of an investigation into [Mr.] Yasinski’s homicide” (para. 78).

[131]                     We agree with the majority that a reasonable person in Mr. Lafrance’s position would feel singled out for investigation. However, “[f]ocussed suspicion, in and of itself, does not turn the encounter into a detention” (Grant, at para. 41). The significance of this consideration is diminished in these circumstances by statements by the police that Mr. Lafrance was free to leave — as did all the other occupants of the house.

(2)         Police Conduct

[132]                     Key to our conclusion on detention are the police statements on several occasions that Mr. Lafrance was under no obligation to cooperate, and he was free to leave at any time. The passages highlighted by the majority bear repeating: “you don’t have to provide me a statement . . . that it would be completely voluntary on your point”, “you don’t hafta sit here and speak with me today”, “you are at any time Nigel free to leave”, “we (unintelligible) responsibility to ensure that you’re aware of – of your rights and . . . and like I said that – that includes the ability to leave whenever you want to”, “[v]oluntary that you don’t have to sit here and speak with me”, “you say you’re willing to talk now . . . right in half an hour, 20 minutes, two hours you’re – you decide that – that you no longer wanta speak with me . . . Um you just have to let me know . . . Okay and at that point in time, we’ll stop and we’ll move on”, and “some people think well now that I’ve agreed to it . . . I’m stuck here right . . . And – that’s absolutely not the case” (fn. 3, quoting A.R., vol. IV, at pp. 56, 64 and 72-74).

[133]                     The question, in our view, is whether police by their conduct undermined their statements. The record demonstrates that they did not.

(a)           Actions and Language of Police

[134]                     Conspicuously absent from the majority’s list of factors relating to police actions and language (at para. 40) is the evidence as to how police actually interacted with Mr. Lafrance. The record demonstrates that Sgt. Eros did not pressure Mr. Lafrance to come to the police station. Not only did Sgt. Eros specify that coming to the station was “completely voluntary”, but he also mentioned that the interview did not need to take place that day. Indeed, Sgt. Eros asked Mr. Lafrance whether he had to go to work or to “any appointments or anything like that”, stressing that he did not “wanna hold [Mr. Lafrance] up from anything” (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 57). Sergeant Eros’ approach preserved Mr. Lafrance’s freedom of choice.

[135]                     In his own words, Mr. Lafrance “had no problems with how anybody treated [him] that day” because police treated him “respectfully and politely” at every stage of the interaction; “everything went smooth” (A.R., vol. III, at pp. 220‑21). Thus, the trial judge found that Mr. Lafrance “was comfortable with what occurred that day” (para. 56). Police did not undermine their various statements that he was free to leave, either before or after the interview. In fact, in relation to the collection of physical evidence subsequent to the interview, the trial judge noted that “[Mr.] Lafrance and Sgt. Eros continue[d] their banter” (para. 58).

[136]                     In such circumstances, we do not find any reviewable error in the trial judge’s decision. With respect, a careful and deferential review of the record requires a rejection of the factors that — according to the majority — “outweig[h]” the police statements that Mr. Lafrance was free to go (para. 40). To further demonstrate why, we will address the conduct of the police in greater detail.

(i)            Execution of the Search Warrant

[137]                     Apart from the instructions by police relating to the execution of the search warrant — which were authorized by law — there is no evidence of any “conduct [giving] rise to an impression of control” (Grant, at para. 51). We acknowledge that police exercised control over the home, thereby ordering all its occupants — including Mr. Lafrance — to leave their residence under supervision. But it does not follow from this that Mr. Lafrance was psychologically detained.

[138]                     In our view, it is appropriate to distinguish between control over the home and control over the person. However, the majority collapses the distinction between the two. This is particularly manifest in its conclusion, which refers only to police actions necessary and proper for the execution of the search warrant: “Given the overwhelming force in which a team of police officers arrived at Mr. Lafrance’s home, ordered him to get dressed and leave his home, and monitored his every movement, the officers should have recognized that a reasonable person in Mr. Lafrance’s shoes would feel obliged to comply with their demands and would conclude that he or she was not free to go” (para. 64 (emphasis added)).

[139]                     It is uncontroversial that Mr. Lafrance had to comply with these demands because they pertained to the proper execution of the search warrant. Indeed, all the occupants of the residence were subject to such orders, as the trial judge duly noted (para. 37). Police monitoring of the residents inside the home was also closely related to the integrity of their search, rather than specific to Mr. Lafrance.

[140]                     The majority’s remark that Mr. Lafrance’s every movement was monitored outside the home (see paras. 8, 31, 43, 47 and 63-64) attests to its lack of deference to the trial judge’s findings of fact. The only basis in the record for this conclusion is Mr. Lafrance’s claim that police “chaperoned” him while he was attempting to retrieve his cat (R.F, at paras. 7 and 32; A.R., vol. III, at pp. 91‑93). The trial judge, we stress, expressed “insurmountable concerns about the credibility of [Mr.] Lafrance’s evidence” (para. 34). The trial judge found Mr. Lafrance to be generally “dishonest”, highlighting several “implausible” and “unreasonable and self‑serving” statements from his testimony (paras. 28, 31 and 34). More specifically, Mr. Lafrance’s testimony was rejected “where it [was] not consistent with that of police officers” (para. 34).

[141]                     By contrast, Sgt. Eros — a “credible and reliable witness” whose testimony the trial judge found to be “honest and accurate” (paras. 19 and 24) — said that “the officers that were outside at that time were assisting [Mr. Lafrance] to try to locate the cat” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 103 (emphasis added)). Furthermore, Sgt. Eros could not recall seeing officers in the immediate proximity of Mr. Lafrance while he was trying to get the cat (at p. 103), but simply noted that “[h]e would have been in sight of police officers” (p. 93). Sergeant Eros’ testimony is reflected in the trial judge’s findings that police were merely “in the vicinity” of Mr. Lafrance at the time (at para. 37) and that he “was not being told to stay with police; he was simply instructed to leave the residence” (para. 43). These findings by the trial judge do not support a conclusion that Mr. Lafrance was subject to psychological detention.

(ii)         Ride to the Police Station

[142]                     The initial interaction at Mr. Lafrance’s residence was followed by a 20‑minute ride to the police station in an unmarked police vehicle. We disagree with the majority’s assertion that this militates in favour of detention; in doing so, we are mindful of police conduct relating to the ride and the fact that Mr. Lafrance chose this option.

[143]                     The majority states that “[t]he only practical means available to Mr. Lafrance for getting to the police station was for him to be driven, which he was in an unmarked police vehicle accompanied by two police officers” (para. 40). Yet, this contradicts the trial judge’s factual findings. The trial judge found that “[Mr.] Lafrance agreed he had transportation ‘options of people who had vehicles at home’” (para. 39), based on his statement in cross-examination. The other occupants of the residence present at the time — Mr. Lafrance’s girlfriend and his father as well as one of the downstairs tenants — “all left the house and went their different ways” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 214). Stated differently, Mr. Lafrance had multiple transportation options, but he chose to accompany Sgt. Eros to the station in the police car (trial reasons, at para. 39).

[144]                     The conversation on the way to the police station was “lighthearted”, and Mr. Lafrance’s “comfortable demeanour and engagement indicate his participation was entirely voluntary and a produc[t] of deliberate choice” (trial reasons, at paras. 42 and 44). From the parking lot to the interview room, Mr. Lafrance “was not held, or in any sense physically controlled or guided” by police (para. 42).

(iii)        Interview

[145]                     At the outset of the interview, Sgt. Eros “stresses something that is ‘important’: the statement is voluntary and [Mr.] Lafrance can leave at any time” (trial reasons, at para. 47). The trial judge noted that Sgt. Eros devoted “[a]pproximately the first 15 minutes of the interview [to] explaining the process and the related legal rights of [Mr.] Lafrance” (para. 51).

[146]                     What is more, the nature of the interview militates against a finding of psychological detention. As the trial judge pointed out, Sgt. Eros’ “interview style was deliberately non-accusatory”, and his “questioning [was] focused on information‑gathering” (paras. 75 and 77). Sergeant Eros provided Mr. Lafrance with an “opportunity to answer questions ‘freely and flexibly’ and of his ‘free will’” (para. 75). Mr. Lafrance “was not confronted with evidence pointing to his guilt. He was not accused of an offence” (para. 77). These findings indicate that police carefully avoided anything akin to accusatory interrogation.

(iv)        Collection of Physical Evidence

[147]                     After the interview, police asked Mr. Lafrance whether he would consent to provide DNA and fingerprint samples, as well as some of his clothes and his cellphone, which he did without reservation. Mr. Lafrance also agreed to have the police photograph his hands. It is noteworthy that police expressly gave him an opportunity to speak to a lawyer prior to the DNA testing, but he declined the offer.

[148]                     The evidence demonstrates Mr. Lafrance was keen to collaborate. The trial judge noted that Mr. Lafrance “volunteer[ed] for fingerprinting even before Sgt. Eros completed his request” (para. 57). Moreover, Mr. Lafrance voluntarily provided additional, unsolicited information on his cellphone, as the trial judge noted, at para. 68:

I note [Mr.] Lafrance did not merely provide the RCMP with the cell phone and assured them it was not locked with a password or passcode, [Mr.] Lafrance also explained a quirk of that cell phone to assist the RCMP investigators. The cell phone had a bent battery, and that meant the cell phone would reset itself unexpected[ly]. The implication behind [Mr.] Lafrance sharing that fact is he wanted the RCMP to be able to fairly evaluate whatever kind of information they might obtai[n] from the cell phone.

[149]                     A further indication of police conduct is the nature of the communication between Sgt. Eros and Mr. Lafrance during collection of the physical evidence. The trial judge noted that “[Mr.] Lafrance and Sgt. Eros continue[d] their banter”. Nothing in the foregoing supports the conclusion that a reasonable person in Mr. Lafrance’s position would feel detained.

(b)         Physical Contact

[150]                     Physical contact is particularly significant in determining whether individuals informed by police they are free to go are nevertheless psychologically detained. Statements about freedom to leave would not be reasonably perceived as genuine where police, directly or indirectly, restrict the subject’s liberty of movement. This can include situations where physical proximity has an objectively oppressive effect on the individual — for example, where police officers deliberately position themselves within a small space “in a manner to block the exit” (R. v. Le, 2019 SCC 34, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 692, at para. 50).

[151]                     We agree with the majority that there was no evidence of physical contact or oppressive proximity that could support a finding of psychological detention in this case. On the contrary, the trial judge found no evidence of physical obstruction by police at any stage of the encounter (paras. 43, 45 and 70).

(c)           Presence of Others

[152]                     The majority uses the presence of others as a “significant consideration” (para. 43) in that Mr. Lafrance was in the presence of police throughout the interaction. We disagree. Nothing in the record indicates the police brought in more officers than reasonably necessary to ensure police and public safety and the effectiveness of the search. Moreover, Le makes clear, at para. 63, that the “presence of others” refers to witnesses, not police officers:

In this case, the presence of others would likely increase, not decrease, a reasonable person’s perception that they were being detained. Each man witnessed what was happening to them all. The presence of others clearly did not prevent the police entry in the first place or provide any privacy, security or protection against incursions thereafter. Each man saw that the police asked each of them who they were and what they were doing.

Indeed, an assessment of the presence of police officers throughout the encounter at this stage, although relevant, is redundant with the considerations already assessed by the majority in discussing the actions and language of police as well as their proximity to Mr. Lafrance.

[153]                     In any event, the presence of other police officers (in addition to Sgt. Eros) is of no consequence in this case given how the police conducted themselves. As well, there were no other members of the public around Mr. Lafrance from the moment he accepted to go to the police station.

(d)         Place and Duration of the Encounter

[154]                     The interview at the police station and the taking of physical evidence at the end of the interview warrant close attention. At the outset, Sgt. Eros informed Mr. Lafrance that the door of the interview room was unlocked and that he was “at any time . . . free to leave” (trial reasons, at para. 47). At the same time, Sgt. Eros indicated that they were in a “secure environment”, so that Mr. Lafrance would need to be accompanied by police for “smoke or bathroom breaks” (para. 48). Given that Mr. Lafrance knew he could leave at any time, we agree with the trial judge that the fact that he would need to be accompanied while in the secured area of the station is “inconsequential” (para. 70). This is further supported by the trial judge’s statement that “this procedure was not a product of the [non‑accusatory] interview process and was not unique to [Mr.] Lafrance” (para. 71). Simply put, an individual is not detained just because he or she is the subject of a police interview (Grant, at para. 26, quoting from R. v. Mann, 2004 SCC 52, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 59, at para. 19).

[155]                     Regard must be had to the duration of the interview — about 3 and a half hours, including “approximately 30 min[utes] (involving two separate occasions) during which [Mr.] Lafrance was alone in the interview room” (trial reasons, at para. 46). Intensive interrogation, particularly if it lasts for a long time, can reasonably lead to the conclusion that the individual is being detained.

[156]                     The trial judge, however, was alive to this issue. He noted that the “interview was lengthier than generally occurred in non-accusatory sessions” (para. 19; see also para. 89). The trial judge commented on the nature of the interview as follows:

The March 19, 2015 interview recordings indicate there is a steady dialogue exchange between Sgt. Eros and [Mr.] Lafrance. Sergeant Eros intended this be a conversation, and not an interrogation. His interview style was deliberately non-accusatory. It was designed to offer [Mr.] Lafrance the opportunity to answer questions “freely and flexibly” and of his “free will”. His interview style was deliberately non-accusatory.

 

. . .

 

The manner in which the March 19, 2015 interview was conducted was also not oppressive. Instead, it was a conversation. Sergeant Eros directed his inquiries in an open‑ended and non-accusatory manner. In effect, this interview was a direct, fair information gathering procedure. [paras. 75 and 90]

In these circumstances, having regard to the conversational interview style and the absence of any confrontation, we see no basis to differ from the trial judge’s conclusion that the length of the interview does not suffice to turn it into a coercive interrogation or, ultimately, constitute (alone or with earlier events) the basis of a psychological detention.

(e)           Summary

[157]                     In assessing police conduct, the majority substitutes its own view of the evidence for that of the trial judge, relying in part on the controverted evidence of Mr. Lafrance — a witness found to be dishonest. There is no credible evidence that police gave orders or closely monitored Mr. Lafrance for purposes other than the execution of the search warrant.

[158]                     Rather, the events — viewed in their entirety in line with the trial judge’s findings of fact — indicate that police asserted control over the home without coercing Mr. Lafrance, except to the extent necessary for the execution of the search warrant. In dealing with Mr. Lafrance, Sgt. Eros repeatedly reminded him that he was under no obligation to cooperate and could leave at any time, as well as ensuring that he understood his Charter right to silence at the beginning of the interview. Far from disclosing coercive behaviour, the evidence suggests Sgt. Eros had a lighthearted conversation with Mr. Lafrance during the ride to the police station, and the pair continued to banter after the conversational, non-confrontational interview. Nothing in the foregoing constitutes a basis to contradict the trial judge’s conclusion that Mr. Lafrance was not subject to psychological detention.

(3)         Particular Circumstances of the Individual

[159]                     The trial judge “acknowledge[d] Mr. Lafrance was youthful, [I]ndigenous and had minimal police exposure at that time” (para. 79). As to physical stature, “[i]t is clear [Mr.] Lafrance is physically smaller than Sgt. Eros and his partner” (para. 73). Moreover, the trial judge found that Mr. Lafrance was “demonstrably intelligent” and “not unsophisticated”, although he “was naïve in deciding his participation would counter police suspicion” (paras. 80‑81 and 91).

[160]                     An individual’s youth, Indigenous background, lack of experience, and small stature are all material in determining whether police undermined statements that the subject was free to go. But such factors are not determinative. Yet the majority seems to say (at para. 54) that detention automatically arises where police interview a young adult after executing a search warrant at his or her residence. That the detention inquiry is objective does not mean the reviewing court must conduct an abstract analysis unsupported by evidence (Grant, at para. 32; R. v. Suberu, 2009 SCC 33, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 460, at para. 28). Contrary to the majority’s claim (at para. 64), there is no evidentiary support for the assertion that the execution of the search warrant in this case was conducted in a manner that would make a reasonable person in Mr. Lafrance’s position feel detained. It follows that the majority’s conclusions appear to be based on the circumstances of Mr. Lafrance only.

[161]                     Having regard to Mr. Lafrance’s particular circumstances, we acknowledge that police needed to tread carefully, but they did so, such that even having regard to Mr. Lafrance’s personal characteristics, he was not psychologically detained.

[162]                     This conclusion is buttressed by the trial judge’s factual determinations as to Mr. Lafrance’s perceptions of the events. Such subjective considerations, although not determinative, help to assess whether a reasonable person in Mr. Lafrance’s position would have perceived the police conduct as coercive (Grant, at para. 32; Suberu, at paras. 28 and 32). The following findings of fact are particularly significant in this regard:

•         Mr. Lafrance “agreed he went to the detachment and then interviewed so he could allay suspicions and be discounted as a suspect. His comfortable demeanour and engagement indicate his participation was entirely voluntary and a produc[t] of deliberate choice” (trial reasons, at para. 44);

•         “[T]hroughout the process [Mr.] Lafrance never appears to be compelled, frightened or intimidated. He appears at ease. [Mr.] Lafrance is cooperative throughout the interview. His manner is friendly and open. There is no indication of defensive body language. Instead, at points [Mr.] Lafrance leans forward, into the conversation” (para. 73);

•         Mr. Lafrance “understood police direction that he was free to leave at any time. He also acknowledged tactically answering questions to counter police suspicion” (para. 74).

[163]                     These findings of fact confirm what is otherwise objectively ascertainable: a reasonable person in Mr. Lafrance’s shoes would not have perceived the police conduct as a significant deprivation of his liberty. Police did not exert pressure or control over him. Indeed, Mr. Lafrance himself was eager to cooperate so as to allay suspicions. This, too, militates against a finding of psychological detention.

(4)         Conclusion

[164]                     We conclude Mr. Lafrance was not detained within the meaning of ss. 9 and 10(b) of the Charter in his interactions with police on March 19, 2015. Based on a deferential approach to the trial judge’s findings of fact, a reasonable person in Mr. Lafrance’s position would not have felt compelled to go to the police station and participate in the interview. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that he chose to cooperate, seeking to allay police suspicion. Mr. Lafrance’s objective personal characteristics, although significant to the inquiry, do not turn the tide in these circumstances.

B.            Mr. Lafrance’s Section 10(b) Right to Counsel Was Not Violated on April 7, 2015, When He Was Not Permitted a Second Consultation With Counsel

[165]                     Mr. Lafrance’s next argument is that when he was interviewed on April 7, 2015, the police should have permitted him to have a second consultation with counsel. He argues that when police did not permit this, his s. 10(b) rights were infringed. The majority agrees. With respect, we do not.

(1)         Legal Principles

[166]                     This issue is governed by this Court’s decisions in Sinclair and its companion cases R. v. McCrimmon, 2010 SCC 36, [2010] 2 S.C.R 402, and R. v. Willier, 2010 SCC 37, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 429.

[167]                     Section 10(b)’s purpose is to provide a detainee with an opportunity to obtain information and legal advice relevant to his or her legal situation upon detention (Sinclair, at paras. 25 and 31). The protection offered by s. 10(b) ensures “that a suspect is able to make a choice to speak to the police investigators that is both free and informed” (Sinclair, at paras. 25 and 32, citing R. v. Hebert, 1990 CanLII 118 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151, at pp. 176‑77).

[168]                     The majority suggests that s. 10(b)’s purpose is to mitigate the imbalance between the individual and the state, similar to the purposes of s. 9 (see the majority’s reasons, at paras. 76‑77). This is not accurate. To the contrary, this Court in Sinclair expressly rejected this view, stating at paras. 30‑31:

Mr. Sinclair argues that the purpose of s. 10(b) is broader than this. In his view, accepted by our colleagues LeBel and Fish JJ., the purpose of s. 10(b) is to advise the detainee on how to deal with police questions. The detainee, it is argued, is in the power of the police. The purpose of s. 10(b) is to restore a power-balance between the detainee and the police in the coercive atmosphere of the police investigation. On this view, the purpose of the right is not so much informational as protective.

 

We cannot accept this view of the purpose of s. 10(b). As will be discussed more fully below, this view of s. 10(b) goes against 25 years of jurisprudence defining s. 10(b) in terms of the right to consult counsel to obtain information and advice immediately upon detention, but not as providing ongoing legal assistance during the course of the interview that follows, regardless of the circumstances. [Emphasis added.]

[169]                     There is no basis to depart from Sinclair on this point, or to find that s. 10(b) is intended to shield the detainee from legitimate interrogation by police (Sinclair, at para. 25). Nor does Willier say that the purpose of s. 10(b) is to protect a detainee from an exercise of state power. Rather it is to “provide [the detainee] an opportunity to mitigate [the] legal disadvantage” relative to the state and “to support the detainee’s right to choose whether to cooperate with the police investigation or not, by giving him access to legal advice on the situation he is facing” (Willier, at para 28; Sinclair, at para. 32).

[170]                     Section 10(b)’s purpose is achieved in two ways. It imposes on the police a duty to advise the detainee of his or her right to counsel (informational component) and to give the detainee an opportunity to exercise his or her right to consult counsel (implementational component). It is not in issue that in this case, the informational component was met.

[171]                     The implementational component is “[n]ormally . . . achieved by a single consultation at the time of detention or shortly thereafter” (Sinclair, at para. 47). A few minutes on the phone with counsel may suffice, even for serious charges (see Willier). Sinclair is clear that s. 10(b) does not provide a constitutional right “to ongoing legal assistance during the course of the interview”, or to have counsel present throughout the interview (paras. 31 and 36).

[172]                     Sometimes, however, a second consultation with counsel will be required. In Sinclair, this Court described three categories of “changed circumstances” that will require a second consultation, at paras. 2 and 50‑54:

1)      When there are new procedures involving the detainee;

2)      When there is a change in the detainee’s jeopardy; or

3)      When there is reason to question the detainee’s understanding of his or her s. 10(b) right.

[173]                     Where the circumstances do not fall into a previously recognized category, the question is whether a further opportunity to consult a lawyer is necessary to fulfill s. 10(b)’s purpose of providing the detainee with advice in the new or emergent situation. The principle underlying the cases is that to require a second consultation, there must be a change in circumstances such that the choice faced by the detainee has been “significantly altered, requiring further advice on the new situation, in order to fulfill the purpose of s. 10(b)” (Sinclair, at paras. 54 and 65).

(2)         Application to the Case

[174]                     The majority concludes that Mr. Lafrance’s situation fits within the third Sinclair category, i.e. that there was reason to question Mr. Lafrance’s understanding of his s. 10(b) right. The police should have permitted him to have a second consultation with counsel, but did not. Therefore, his 10(b) rights were infringed, the majority concludes.

[175]                     The third category is engaged in circumstances such as when a detainee who has waived his or her right to counsel may not have understood this right when he or she waived it (Sinclair, at para. 52; R. v. Prosper, 1994 CanLII 65 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 236, at pp. 282‑84). It can also apply if police undermine the advice provided by counsel (Sinclair, at para. 52; R. v. Dussault, 2022 SCC 16). More generally, it applies when circumstances indicate that the “detainee may not have understood the initial s. 10(b) advice of his right to counsel” (Sinclair, at para. 52). There is no basis for the foregoing in this case.

[176]                     The fact that a detainee demonstrates hesitancy or concern during an interview or interrogation is not, on its own, sufficient to establish that he or she did not have a full opportunity to consult with counsel. It is assumed that the legal advice received was sufficient in relation to how the detainee should exercise his or her rights in the context of the police investigative interview (Sinclair, at para. 57; McCrimmon at paras. 23‑24). As the Court held in Willier, at para. 42, “unless a detainee indicates, diligently and reasonably, that the advice he or she received is inadequate, the police may assume that the detainee is satisfied with the exercised right to counsel and are entitled to commence an investigative interview”. Only where there is an objective change in circumstances, or objective reason to believe the initial consultation was deficient, will the need for a second consultation arise.

[177]                     When his interactions with police are reviewed, it cannot seriously be questioned that Mr. Lafrance’s choice to speak to the investigators was both free and informed.

[178]                     The majority refers to two portions of the April 7, 2015 interview in support of its conclusion that Mr. Lafrance’s 10(b) rights were infringed. First, the majority points out that, as the discussion between Mr. Lafrance and Sgt. Eros progressed, Sgt. Eros’ questions became more pointed. He began asking specific questions about the murder. At that point, Mr. Lafrance mentioned his father and a lawyer for the first time:

Q. Alright so what happens Nigel?

A.  Well –.

Q.  What – what went on?

A.  Well I would – ah I want to talk to my dad before I continue.

Q.  Ok wh – why do you say that?

A.  Cause well he’s – well he’s my only chance of getting a lawyer and I just – I don’t know. [Emphasis added.]

 

(A.R., vol. V, at p. 137)

[179]                     We accept that, in the circumstances, Mr. Lafrance’s request to speak to his father was an implicit request for a second consultation with a lawyer. It does not follow, however, that his 10(b) rights were breached because this request was denied. The detainee merely asking for a second consultation is not enough to engage any Sinclair category that would support a right to a second consultation. To decide otherwise would be to depart fundamentally from Sinclair.

[180]                     The second interview excerpt referred to by the majority, which it concludes demonstrates “clear signs” that either the legal advice Mr. Lafrance obtained was incorrect, or he did not understand how his s. 10(b) rights applied to his current circumstances, reads as follows:

A.   Well I – I just – I want a lawyer before I go forward with anything else.

Q.  Ok you’ve had your opportunity Nigel right? Like I – like I explained to you, you’ve had an opportunity to speak to a lawyer – we don’t ah – .

A.  Well no they told me – they told me to get a lawyer before I continue talking.

Q.  Ok what do you mean by told you to get a lawyer?

A.  Like someone that can come down and sit with me.

Q.  Ok.

A.  Instead of just over the phone.

Q.  There’s a person that ah you know what – and the way that that kinda goes ah – I won’t say it’s, it’s bad advice but it’s maybe miss – a little bit miss as – miss ah – interrupted. Um there’s not any time or any process during our interview –.

A.  Um?

Q.  Where we’re gonna have a lawyer sitting in the room with us.

A.  No, no I – I mean, no mean like so –.

Q.  Ok.

A.  Like for me to sit down with personally.

Q.  Ok.

A.  To talk to. [Emphasis added.]

 

(A.R., vol. V, at p. 139)

[181]                     We disagree that this excerpt demonstrates that Mr. Lafrance misunderstood his s. 10(b) rights. In the discussion which immediately follows, Sgt. Eros confirmed Mr. Lafrance understood and exercised his right to counsel:

Q.  Part of the ah – part of the – the process right, is that we need to insure that you were provided some legal advice right.

A.  Ya.

Q.  And that you spoke to a lawyer and that you understood that legal advice right?

A.  Ya.

Q.  Um and that we’ve gone through that process right?

A.  Um.

Q.  So what has to happen now is we have to kinda evaluate that and see where we’re at with respect to that ok.

A.  Ya.

Q.  But there is ah we – we still need to have this conversation right Nigel?

A. Well – well ah the advice that was given to me is I don’t have to say anything.

Q. Ya and – and that’s excellent advice right. [Emphasis added.]

 

(A.R., vol. V, at p. 140)

[182]                     The above excerpt demonstrates that Mr. Lafrance fully understood his rights under s. 10(b). Mr. Lafrance knew the legal jeopardy that he was facing. He knew he did not have to say anything to Sgt. Eros. His discomfort in the face of difficult police questioning is not, on its own, grounds for a second consultation. It bears repeating that right after his first consultation, an officer had asked Mr. Lafrance if he understood the advice, to which Mr. Lafrance answered “yes”. He did not indicate reasonably and diligently that the advice he received was inadequate, or was not conveyed in a manner he understood. Contrary to the majority’s statements (at para. 86), there is no basis in the evidence for such a conclusion. The officer then asked him whether the lawyer he spoke to was attending the RCMP detachment, to which Mr. Lafrance answered “no”. Mr. Lafrance knew no one was coming.

[183]                     Even if one accepts that Mr. Lafrance incorrectly believed that he had a constitutional right to have a lawyer present, mere confusion on this point is not enough to trigger a constitutional obligation under s. 10(b). Sinclair expressly held that there must be an objective basis for a second consultation to be permitted (para. 55; see also McCrimmon, at paras. 22‑23).

[184]                     In fact, the circumstances here are similar to those in Sinclair. In Sinclair, the accused also appeared to misunderstand what his s. 10(b) rights involved, stating during the interview that he had nothing to say “until my lawyer’s around and he tells me what’s going on” (Sinclair, at para. 8 (emphasis added)). The police explained to him that he had the right to consult a lawyer, but not to have a lawyer present during questioning. Mr. Sinclair then confessed. A majority of this Court found no infringement of Mr. Sinclair’s s. 10(b) rights.

[185]                     Contrary to the majority’s holdings, there is no basis to conclude that the choice faced by Mr. Lafrance was significantly altered so as to require further advice in order to fulfill the purpose of his s. 10(b) rights.

[186]                     While Mr. Lafrance is Indigenous, nothing on these facts suggests that these circumstances alone bring the case into the third Sinclair category.

[187]                     While purporting to follow Sinclair, the majority unduly expands its reach so as to undermine fundamentally the framework for analysis set out in that case. Without saying so directly, the majority’s logic seems to be that a detainee is entitled to further consultation with counsel, upon request, or upon a mere confusion about his or her rights. This Court has never interpreted s. 10(b) in that manner. The detainee has a right to make a decision to cooperate with the investigation or to decline to do so in a free and informed manner. However, the state is entitled to rely on legitimate means of interrogation to investigate crimes (Sinclair, at para. 25). There was no breach of Mr. Lafrance’s s. 10(b) rights on April 7, 2015.

C.            Whether or Not Mr. Lafrance’s Right to Counsel Was Violated on March 19, 2015, Such That His Statements and Other Evidence Obtained Should Be Excluded Under Section 24(2)

[188]                     As we explain above, we conclude that on March 19, 2015, Mr. Lafrance was not detained. The trial judge’s conclusions on the issue of detention are owed deference and there is no basis to depart from them. However, even if it could be said that the trial judge erred, and that Mr. Lafrance was detained on March 19, 2015, without being afforded his right to counsel, we conclude that the evidence was not sufficiently connected to that Charter breach. There is therefore no basis on which to exclude such evidence under s. 24(2).

[189]                     Under s. 24(2) of the Charter, a court may exclude evidence obtained “in a manner” that violates Charter rights if its admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. “Whether evidence was ‘obtained in a manner’ that infringed an accused’s rights under the Charter depends on the nature of the connection between the Charter violation and the evidence that was ultimately obtained” (R. v. Mack, 2014 SCC 58, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 38; R. v. Tim, 2022 SCC 12, at para. 78).

[190]                     In R. v. Wittwer, 2008 SCC 33, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 21, this Court found that “[t]he required connection between the breach and [the evidence obtained] may be ‘temporal, contextual, causal or a combination of the three’: R. v. Plaha (2004), 2004 CanLII 21043 (ON CA), 189 O.A.C. 376, at para. 45. A connection that is merely ‘remote’ or ‘tenuous’ will not suffice.” The requisite connection must be shown before a court considers whether the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute (Grant, at para. 131). The burden of proving that a remedy should be granted under s. 24(2) is on the party who seeks the remedy, here Mr. Lafrance (R. v. Collins, 1987 CanLII 84 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 280).

[191]                     During the March 19, 2015 interview, Mr. Lafrance provided police with general information, a blood sample, fingerprints, cellphone and some of his clothing. The Crown did not seek to introduce any of this evidence, nor Mr. Lafrance’s March 19, 2015 police statement, at trial. There is therefore no need to consider whether this evidence should be excluded.

[192]                     As to the April 7, 2015 statement, the trial judge found it was not sufficiently connected to the March 19, 2015 statement. The majority of the Court of Appeal disagreed, holding that some information obtained as a result of the March 19, 2015 interview formed the basis of questions in the April 7, 2015 interview. In our view, the majority of the Court of Appeal should not have substituted its view for the view of the trial judge. The trial judge found that the March 19, 2015 statement did not substantially contribute to the April 7, 2015 statement. He based this on Mr. Lafrance’s testimony that the first statement “had nothing to do with” the second. There is no proper or principled basis to interfere with the trial judge’s findings in this regard.

[193]                     Mr. Lafrance has not shown that any evidence presented at trial has the requisite link with the alleged March 19, 2015 detention and any resulting breach of the right to counsel.

IV.         Conclusion

[194]                     For the foregoing reasons, we are of the view that there was no basis upon which the Court of Appeal, nor the majority in this Court, should interfere with the ruling of the trial judge. The appeal should be allowed and Mr. Lafrance’s conviction for second degree murder restored.

                  Martin J. —

I.               Introduction

[1]                             This appeal raises an important legal question about consent and condom use in the context of an allegation of sexual assault. What analytical framework applies when the complainant agrees to vaginal sexual intercourse only if the accused wears a condom, and he instead chooses not to wear one? All parties and members of this Court agree that his negation of her express limits on how she can be touched engages the criminal law. The question is: should condom use form part of the “sexual activity in question” to which a person may provide voluntary agreement under s. 273.1(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46? Or alternatively, is condom use always irrelevant to the presence or absence of consent under s. 273.1(1), meaning that there is consent but it may be vitiated if it rises to the level of fraud under s. 265(3)(c) of the Criminal Code?

[2]                             I conclude that when consent to intercourse is conditioned on condom use, the only analytical framework consistent with the text, context and purpose of the prohibition against sexual assault is that there is no agreement to the physical act of intercourse without a condom. Sex with and without a condom are fundamentally and qualitatively distinct forms of physical touching. A complainant who consents to sex on the condition that their partner wear a condom does not consent to sex without a condom. This approach respects the provisions of the Criminal Code, this Court’s consistent jurisprudence on consent and sexual assault and Parliament’s intent to protect the sexual autonomy and human dignity of all persons in Canada. Since only yes means yes and no means no, it cannot be that “no, not without a condom” means “yes, without a condom”. If a complainant’s partner ignores their stipulation, the sexual intercourse is non-consensual and their sexual autonomy and equal sexual agency have been violated.

[3]                             Here, the complainant gave evidence that she had communicated to the appellant that her consent to sex was contingent on condom use. Despite the clear establishment of her physical boundaries, the appellant disregarded her wishes and did not wear a condom. This was evidence of a lack of subjective consent by the complainant — an element of the actus reus of sexual assault. As a result, the trial judge erred in granting the appellant’s no evidence motion. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal and uphold the order of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia setting aside the acquittal and remitting the matter to the Provincial Court of British Columbia for a new trial.

II.            Background

[4]                             The appellant, Ross McKenzie Kirkpatrick, was charged with the sexual assault of the complainant based upon events that occurred in March 2017. The allegation of criminal conduct relates only to the parties’ second act of vaginal sexual intercourse in which Mr. Kirkpatrick admits he penetrated and ejaculated into the complainant without wearing a condom.

[5]                             The complainant was the only person to give evidence at trial. She testified that she was 22 years old at the time of the trial and that she and Mr. Kirkpatrick met online. After messaging back and forth, she thought he could be a potential sexual partner and they met in person to determine if they wanted to have sex with each other. In that meeting, they discussed themselves, past sexual partners and present sexual practices. The complainant made clear to Mr. Kirkpatrick that she would only agree to sex using condoms. While he said that he “hasn’t used them”, she “mentioned that I only have sex if I use condoms. It’s the only way I feel like it’s the safest for everyone involved” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 17). During that conversation, the appellant also agreed that it is safest for everyone involved to use condoms.

[6]                             A few days after this meeting, the complainant and Mr. Kirkpatrick arranged to meet at Mr. Kirkpatrick’s home to have sex. They went to Mr. Kirkpatrick’s bedroom. When Mr. Kirkpatrick “motioned for [her] to . . . get on his penis” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 20), she asked him if he had any condoms and told him that if he did not, she had brought some with her. When questioned at trial about why she had asked this, she replied that it was “[b]ecause I only have protected sex. And I ‑‑ and I wanted to have sex, so I wanted to make sure that he had a condom” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 22).

[7]                             Mr. Kirkpatrick told the complainant that he had condoms, and he put one on. It was dark in the room, but the complainant saw Mr. Kirkpatrick turn to his right and take a condom from his bedside table. She heard the wrapper open and saw Mr. Kirkpatrick making motions consistent with putting on a condom. They proceeded to have vaginal intercourse, with the complainant positioned on her back. Mr. Kirkpatrick asked the complainant where he could ejaculate, and she told him he could not ejaculate on her vagina or buttocks. Mr. Kirkpatrick removed the condom and ejaculated on the complainant’s stomach.

[8]                             After they finished having sex in his room, they were in the bathroom together. While there, the complainant asked Mr. Kirkpatrick whether he wore a condom and he said he did. She asked to see it because the bedroom was dark and it was important to her that he had worn one. He went back to his room, retrieved it and showed it to her. She saw that the condom was stretched out and was reassured it had been used.

[9]                             The complainant fell asleep in Mr. Kirkpatrick’s bed and was awakened to Mr. Kirkpatrick placing his erect penis against her buttocks. She pushed him away and saw him turn towards his bedside table — the same one from which he had previously retrieved a condom. She thought he put a condom on. She repositioned herself onto her stomach and Mr. Kirkpatrick penetrated her vaginally with his penis. After about a minute, he asked the complainant if this felt better than the last time. She agreed, believing that he was referring to the different position.

[10]                        After a period of time, they changed position and she was then on her back. When his penis fell out he asked her to guide it back into her, which she did. They continued to have sex until Mr. Kirkpatrick ejaculated inside her. It was not until this point that the complainant realized that during this second episode of intercourse he had not been wearing a condom.

[11]                        The complainant testified that she felt shocked and panicked and left the bedroom. She had trusted Mr. Kirkpatrick based on their previous discussions and his use of a condom when they first had intercourse previously that evening. She was upset by the lack of respect he had shown for the boundaries she had set and the lack of concern he had shown for the potential repercussions and consequences she could face from his decision not to use a condom. Mr. Kirkpatrick suggested she “could just get an . . . abortion” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 25). When she expressed fear of contracting a sexually transmitted infection (“STI”), he was very relaxed about the idea of transmission because he said people could now just live with infections such as HIV, chlamydia and gonorrhea.

[12]                        The next afternoon, the complainant texted Mr. Kirkpatrick to ask him why he had not worn a condom despite her specific request that he do so. He replied that he had been “too excited” to put a condom on (A.R., vol. II, at p. 27). When the complainant expressed her view that this could be considered sexual assault, her impression was that Mr. Kirkpatrick thought “it was really funny” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 28). He responded in various texts by sending her a pornography video called “Oh my god, daddy came inside me” and offering to have his friends “gang bang” her (A.R., vol. II, at p. 28).

[13]                        On the advice of medical professionals, the complainant followed a 28-day course of preventive HIV treatment. The treatment had serious physical and mental side effects that affected her day-to-day life and her ability to work.

[14]                        In cross-examination, she maintained that their discussion about the need for condom use not only occurred, but that without it, she would not otherwise have gone to his house and agreed to have sex. She testified that she said multiple times that she only had sex with condoms and that “if we didn’t have a conversation about safe sex before I had sex with him, I wouldn’t have been there that night” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 62). She said his disregard of her express and explicit condition to only have safe sex with a condom was equivalent to “rape”.

[15]                        At the close of the Crown’s case, Mr. Kirkpatrick applied to have the charge of sexual assault dismissed by bringing a no-evidence motion. He argued the Crown had failed to prove the absence of the complainant’s consent, an essential element in the actus reus of sexual assault. Specifically, he argued that based on R. v. Hutchinson, 2014 SCC 19, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 346, her agreement to sexual intercourse was enough to establish consent to the “sexual activity in question” under s. 273.1(1) of the Criminal Code and there was no evidence that this consent was tainted by fraud under s. 265(3)(c). The Crown argued that the sexual intercourse without the required condom was not consensual and alternatively, consent was vitiated by fraud.

[16]                        In determining whether to grant a no-evidence motion, the trial judge must ask “whether or not there is any evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a verdict of guilty” (R. v. Arcuri, 2001 SCC 54, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828, at para. 21, quoting United States of America v. Shephard, 1976 CanLII 8 (SCC), [1977] 2 S.C.R. 1067, at p. 1080; see also R. v. Monteleone, 1987 CanLII 16 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 154, at pp. 160-61). The Crown must adduce some evidence of culpability for every essential definitional element of the crime (R. v. Charemski, 1998 CanLII 819 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 679, at paras. 2-3). If there is any such admissible evidence, a directed verdict is not available (Monteleone, at pp. 160-61; R. v. Barros, 2011 SCC 51, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 368, at para. 48).

[17]                          On a no-evidence motion, the motion judge is compelled, as are we, to accept the facts as stated by the complainant in her testimony as true. The accused may have a different version of events, but the question is whether her evidence, if believed, would justify a conviction (Monteleone, at pp. 160-61, citing Shephard, at p. 1080).

A.           Provincial Court of British Columbia, 2018 BCPC 415 (Solomon Prov. Ct. J.)

[18]                        The trial judge granted Mr. Kirkpatrick’s no-evidence motion and dismissed the sexual assault charge. Relying on Hutchinson, the judge concluded that based on the complainant’s evidence, she had “consented to all the physical acts of sexual relations that the parties engaged in”, despite the fact that no condom was used (para. 27 (CanLII)). Thus, the only issue was whether there was any evidence of fraud vitiating consent. Fraud requires proof of the accused’s dishonesty, which can include non-disclosure, and a deprivation in the form of significant risk of serious bodily harm from that dishonesty. The judge reasoned that, because Mr. Kirkpatrick had made no efforts to deceive the complainant into believing he had worn a condom, there was no evidence of dishonesty and therefore no evidence to support a finding of fraud.

B.            Court of Appeal for British Columbia, 2020 BCCA 136, 63 C.R. (7th) 338 (Saunders, Groberman and Bennett JJ.A.)

[19]                        The Court of Appeal for British Columbia unanimously allowed the Crown’s appeal, set aside the acquittal, and ordered a new trial, although the judges split on the reasoning as to which Criminal Code provision applied in examining consent: s. 273.1(1) or s. 265(3)(c).

[20]                        Groberman J.A. concluded that the trial judge had erred in finding that the complainant had consented to the sexual activity in question under s. 273.1(1). He held that Hutchinson should not be read as excluding important physical aspects — such as the wearing of a condom — from forming part of the sexual activity in question. Therefore, there was no consent in this case. Groberman J.A. did, however, agree with the trial judge’s conclusion that there was no evidence to support that Mr. Kirkpatrick had attempted to deceive the complainant with respect to condom use so as to engage a fraud analysis under s. 265(3)(c).

[21]                        Bennett J.A. disagreed with Groberman J.A.’s reading of Hutchinson. In her view, the majority reasons in Hutchinson rejected the notion that condom use can form part of the sexual activity in question; instead, deception with respect to condom use must be analyzed under the fraud provision in s. 265(3)(c). On the facts of this case, however, she held the trial judge erred in concluding there was no evidence of fraud.

[22]                        Saunders J.A. agreed in part with both of her colleagues’ reasons, but on different issues. She agreed with Groberman J.A.’s reading of Hutchinson, and in the alternative with Bennett J.A.’s conclusion that there was evidence of fraud.

III.         Issues

[23]                        This appeal raises two questions. First, when a complainant makes their consent to sexual intercourse conditional on their partner wearing a condom, does failure to wear a condom result in “no voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question” under s. 273.1(1) of the Criminal Code, or should failure to wear a condom be analyzed under the fraud provision in s. 265(3)(c)?

[24]                        Second, what is required to establish fraud, and was there some evidence of dishonesty by the appellant capable of constituting fraud vitiating consent under s. 265(3)(c) of the Criminal Code?

IV.         Analysis

A.           The Analytical Framework for Consent and Condom Refusal or Removal

[25]                        Two alternative pathways are available to decide the legal effect of Mr. Kirkpatrick’s failure to wear a condom on the actus reus of sexual assault. To resolve the correct approach, I begin by providing an overview of the offence of sexual assault, including a review of s. 273.1 and s. 265(3) and the constituent elements of the offence. I present the arguments of the respondent Crown and the appellant and then explain why, when it is a condition of the complainant’s consent, condom use must form part of the “sexual activity in question” under s. 273.1 of the Criminal Code. This is the only interpretation that provides a harmonious reading of the text of the relevant provisions in their entire context and that accords with Parliament’s purpose of promoting personal autonomy and equal sexual agency. Finally, I will explain why Hutchinson does not mandate another result for the specific issue raised in this appeal.

(1)         The Offence of Sexual Assault

[26]                        In the early 1980s, Parliament modernized and fundamentally restructured the Criminal Code provisions on sexual offences. It repealed discriminatory evidentiary rules and moved away from prior specific provisions, like the prohibition against rape, to instead adopt prohibitions grounded in the law of assault. This change reflected the shift away from “categorizing sexual offences based on the nature of the sexual act and the perceived chastity of the victim”, and “toward an understanding that treats sexual assault much more like other crimes of violence” (J. Benedet, “Judicial Misconduct in the Sexual Assault Trial” (2019), 52 U.B.C. L. Rev. 1, at p. 17).

[27]                        As a result, under s. 265(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, a person commits an assault by intentionally applying force to another person, directly or indirectly, without their consent. Where the assault is sexual in nature, it is an offence under s. 271 of the Criminal Code. Placing assault at the core of the new offences conveyed the central role consent was intended to play in distinguishing criminal sexual conduct from agreed-to sexual activity. 

[28]                        The foundational nature of consent to the offence of sexual assault is demonstrated in its centrality to both the actus reus and the mens rea elements of the offence. The actus reus of the offence is “unwanted sexual touching”, while the mens rea is the intention to touch, knowing, being reckless of, or being wilfully blind to a lack of consent from the person being touched (R. v. Ewanchuk, 1999 CanLII 711 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330, at para. 23). For the actus reus, the absence of consent is entirely subjective and dependent on the complainant’s state of mind about whether they wanted the touching to take place at the time it occurred (Ewanchuk, at paras. 25-27 and 31). There is no need to inquire into the accused’s perspective at the actus reus stage (R. v. Barton, 2019 SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579, at paras. 87 and 89).

[29]                        In 1992, Parliament introduced further amendments to sexual assault in Bill C-49, the Act to amend the Criminal Code (sexual assault), S.C. 1992, c. 38, s. 1, to correct outdated approaches that linked non-consent to physical resistance and to settle debates as to whether passivity, silence, non-resistance or submission could constitute consent. These amendments defined consent for the first time in s. 273.1(1), set out certain circumstances where no consent was obtained as a matter of law in s. 273.1(2), and limited access to the defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent in s. 273.2.

[30]                        Parliament expressly stated its remedial purpose and objectives for enacting these amendments in the preamble to Bill C-49. These amendments were designed to reflect the realities, concerns and rights of complainants, reduce the fear of sexual assault, and encourage the reporting of this traditionally underreported crime. Parliament was “gravely concerned about the incidence of sexual violence and abuse in Canadian society and, in particular, the prevalence of sexual assault against women and children” (Bill C-49, preamble). Parliament wanted to ensure the “full protection of the rights guaranteed under sections 7 and 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms” (protecting the rights to life, liberty and security of the person and the right to the equal protection and benefit of the law without discrimination). One of Parliament’s primary objectives was to promote gender equality and protect individuals’ personal autonomy to make choices about their bodies and whether or not to engage in sexual activity (see House of Commons Debates, vol. VIII, 3rd Sess., 34th Parl., April 8, 1992, at pp. 9505-7). Its objectives are reflected in the framework for consent and the wording of the individual provisions we have today.

[31]                        Section 273.1 is a key provision and operates as the gateway to consent. It is specific to sexual offences, more recent than s. 265(3) and was enacted to “recogniz[e] the unique character of the offence of sexual assault” (Bill C-49, preamble). Subsection 273.1(1) requires “the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question”. Subsection 273.1(2) provides a non-exhaustive list of circumstances in which no consent is obtained in law. At the relevant time, s. 273.1 provided:[1]

273.1 (1) Subject to subsection (2) and subsection 265(3), “consent” means, for the purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question.

    

(2) No consent is obtained, for the purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, where

 

(a) the agreement is expressed by the words or conduct of a person other than the complainant;

 

(b) the complainant is incapable of consenting to the activity;

 

(c) the accused induces the complainant to engage in the activity by abusing a position of trust, power or authority;

 

(d) the complainant expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to engage in the activity; or

 

(e) the complainant, having consented to engage in sexual activity, expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to continue to engage in the activity.

 

(3) Nothing in subsection (2) shall be construed as limiting the circumstances in which no consent is obtained.

[32]                        Subsections (1) and (2) in s. 273.1 both address consent and are to be read together. Subsection (2) is multifaceted and sheds further light on Parliament’s understanding of consent (R. v. J.A., 2011 SCC 28, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 440, at paras. 33 and 35). All but one of the circumstances outlined in s. 273.1(2) operate to clarify what subjective consent requires. Only s. 273.1(2)(c) vitiates consent, where the complainant’s induced agreement by reason of an abuse of power, trust, or authority is deemed ineffective in law (R. v. G.F., 2021 SCC 20, at para. 44).

[33]                        Section 265(3) applies to all forms of assault (including sexual assault). It lists four situations where consent is not obtained as a matter of law, including where consent is obtained by fraud. In these cases, there is subjective consent under s. 273.1, but the law intervenes to vitiate that consent. Section 265(3) provides:

(3) For the purposes of this section, no consent is obtained where the complainant submits or does not resist by reason of

 

(a) the application of force to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant;

 

(b) threats or fear of the application of force to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant;

 

(c) fraud; or

 

(d) the exercise of authority.

[34]                        At the heart of this case is consent at the actus reus stage. When vitiation under s. 265(3) is argued, Hutchinson sets out a two-step process for analyzing consent, even though it does not impose a strict order-of-operations (G.F., at paras. 51-52). At the first step, the question is whether the complainant consented to engage in the sexual activity in question under s. 273.1(1) (Hutchinson, at para. 4). If the complainant consented, or their conduct raises a reasonable doubt about the lack of voluntary agreement to the sexual activity in question, the second step is to consider whether there are any circumstances under s. 265(3) or s. 273.1(2)(c) — including fraud — that vitiate the complainant’s “apparent consent” (Hutchinson, at para. 4). If the complainant has not consented in the first place, there is no consent to be vitiated under s. 265(3) or s. 273.1(2)(c).

[35]                        This Court explained in G.F. how the distinction between a lack of subjective consent to the sexual activity in question under s. 273.1(1) and the vitiation of consent “may be subtle, but it is important” (para. 36). While a lack of subjective consent under s. 273.1(1) is directly linked to the voluntary agreement to the sexual activity in question, vitiating factors under s. 265(3) or s. 273.1(2)(c) are instead tied to various general policy considerations (G.F., at para. 36).

(2)         The Arguments of the Parties

[36]                        The respondent Crown submits that condom use is relevant to a complainant’s consent and is an important aspect of sexual activity within s. 273.1. It says that sex with and without a condom are fundamentally different forms of touching and are physically different types of “sexual activity” under s. 273.1(1). A complainant who consents to sex on the condition that their partner wears a condom does not consent to sex without a condom. Where their partner ignores the request for a condom, the sexual intercourse is non-consensual. In such a case, where the trier of fact finds that the complainant did not voluntarily agree to engage in the sexual activity in question, there is no consent, the actus reus is established and the analysis turns to mens rea. If Hutchinson dictates a different result, the Crown asks this Court to overturn that decision and clarify the law.

[37]                        Alternatively, Mr. Kirkpatrick argues that the only route to a finding of no consent for his failure to wear a condom is fraud under s. 265(3). He submits that the complainant agreed to the sexual activity in question on the basis that she agreed to vaginal sexual intercourse. He claims her consent can only be vitiated if the Crown proves beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) dishonesty, including falsehoods and deliberate deceit as well as the non-disclosure of important facts; and (2) deprivation, or risk of deprivation, which consists of actual risk of serious bodily harm (R. v. Cuerrier, 1998 CanLII 796 (SCC), [1998] 2 S.C.R. 371, at para. 116; R. v. Mabior, 2012 SCC 47, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 584, at para. 12). Serious bodily harm includes physical or psychological hurt or injury that “interferes in a substantial way with the integrity, health or well-being of a victim” (Mabior, at para. 82) and is often tied to physical harms such as the risk of pregnancy and/or sexually transmitted infection (Hutchinson, at paras. 69 and 71). He claims Hutchinson decided that in all cases, condom use can never form part of the physical act and is therefore always irrelevant to consent under s. 273.1(1). He argues that the Crown cannot and did not establish that he deceived the complainant or that she suffered serious bodily harm or a significant risk thereof as a result of his deception. He therefore submits that the trial judge was correct to dismiss the case against him.

[38]                        The parties’ arguments and the decisions at the Court of Appeal demonstrate the two alternative pathways available to decide the legal effect of Mr. Kirkpatrick’s failure to wear a condom on the actus reus of sexual assault.

(3)         Interpreting the “Sexual Activity in Question” in Section 273.1(1)

[39]                        The starting point and primary provision for determining whether there is consent to sexual activity for sexual assault offences is s. 273.1. This particular section was enacted more recently than s. 265(3) and was singularly designed for and uniquely directed to sexual assault offences. This statutory definition of consent plays a central role in Parliament’s assault-based prohibitions against sexual violence. The key term “sexual activity in question” in s. 273.1(1) exists within a composite phrase that requires “voluntary agreement . . . to engage in the sexual activity in question”. We are to seek Parliament’s intent as demonstrated by the text, context, and purpose of the sexual assault provisions and interpret it consistently with this Court’s considerable jurisprudence on consent and “harmonious[ly]” with all parts of s. 273.1 and the overall legislative scheme (J.A., at para. 33).

[40]                          The legal meaning given to the “sexual activity in question” cannot be narrowly drawn or fixed for all cases. Like the consent of which it is part, it is tied to context and cannot be assessed in the abstract; it relates to particular behaviours and actions (Hutchinson, at para. 57; Barton, at para. 88). Much will depend on the facts and circumstances of the individual case. In a very real way, it will be defined by the evidence and the complainant’s allegations. What touching does the complainant say was unlawful? Which acts were beyond the boundaries of any consent given? The sexual activity in question will emerge from a comparison of what actually happened and what, if anything, was agreed to. This is bound to change in every case.

[41]                          Here, the complainant makes no complaint about the first act of vaginal intercourse in which the appellant used the required condom. She nevertheless claims that she never consented to what he did subsequently, which was to have vaginal intercourse without a condom. The specific sexual assault alleged, and the sexual activity in question, was therefore vaginal sexual intercourse without a condom.

[42]                        In determining whether her agreement to sexual intercourse with a condom means she also agreed to sexual intercourse without a condom, we start with the proposition from Hutchinson that the “sexual activity in question” that the complainant must agree to is the “specific physical sex act” (para. 54 (emphasis deleted)). The focus should therefore be on the specific sex act(s), defined by reference to the physical acts involved. The Court in Hutchinson also provided examples of different physical acts, like “kissing, petting, oral sex, intercourse, or the use of sex toys” (para. 54). These were mere illustrations and operate only in comparison to each other in the sense that kissing is a different physical activity than petting; petting is not the same thing as oral sex; and intercourse is distinguished from the use of sex toys. These are not closed or mandatory legal categories of broad sexual activity, regardless of the particular evidence and allegations at issue.

[43]                        Applying Hutchinson’s focus on the “specific physical sex act”, condom use may form part of the sexual activity in question because sexual intercourse without a condom is a fundamentally and qualitatively different physical act than sexual intercourse with a condom. To state the obvious, the physical difference is that intercourse without a condom involves direct skin-to-skin contact, while intercourse with a condom involves indirect contact. Indeed, this difference, of a changed physical experience, is put forward by some men to explain why they prefer not to wear a condom (K. Czechowski et al., “That’s not what was originally agreed to”: Perceptions, outcomes, and legal contextualization of non-consensual condom removal in a Canadian sample, in PLoS ONE, 14(7), July 10, 2019 (online), at p. 2).

[44]                        The law recognizes that consent to penetration in one area of the body does not constitute consent to penetration in a different area because these are distinct physical acts (Hutchinson, at para. 54). Similarly, consent to a form of touching may depend on what is being used to touch the body because the law appreciates there is a physical difference between being touched by a digit, penis, sex toy or other object. It is also clear, for example, that the law sees different specific physical sex acts when a person who has obtained consent to touch a woman’s chest over her clothing instead reaches underneath her clothing to make direct skin to skin contact with her bare breast. In the same way, being touched by a condom-covered penis is not the same specific physical act as being touched by a bare penis. Logically and legally, direct and unmediated sexual touching is a different physical act than indirect and mediated contact. Indeed, given the centrality of the distinction, whether a condom is required is basic to the physical act.

[45]                        All principles of statutory interpretation compel the conclusion that sex with a condom is a different physical activity than sex without a condom. It is the only meaning of the “sexual activity in question” that reads s. 273.1 as a whole and harmoniously with this Court’s jurisprudence on subjective and affirmative consent. In addition, it fulfills Parliament’s objective of giving effect to the equality and dignity-affirming aims underlying the sexual assault prohibitions; responds to the context and harms of non-consensual condom refusal or removal; and respects the restraint principle in criminal law. While vitiation by fraud may still arise in other cases, it does not apply when condom use is a condition of consent.

(a)           It Is the Only Harmonious Reading of Section 273.1 As a Whole

[46]                        Principles of statutory interpretation require that the text of provisions must be read as a whole and harmoniously. It is presumed that provisions are intended to work together as parts of a functioning whole to form a rational, internally consistent framework (R. Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (6th ed. 2014), at §11.2; R. v. L.T.H., 2008 SCC 49, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 739, at para. 47). It follows that when interpreting Parliament’s definition of consent expressed in s. 273.1, subss. (1) and (2) must be read together in a consistent manner.

[47]                        In enacting a definition of consent, Parliament specified situations where no consent would be obtained in relation to sexual assault offences in s. 273.1(2). Section 273.1(2)(d) and (e) in particular provides that there can be no consent if the “complainant expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to engage in the activity” or, “having consented to engage in sexual activity, expresses . . . a lack of agreement to continue to engage in the activity”. While a complainant is not required to express her lack of consent for the actus reus to be established, when she does so it is directly relevant to whether or not there was subjective consent to the sexual activity in question and may also impact whether a mistaken belief in consent could be reasonable under the mens rea analysis (J.A., at paras. 23-24, 41 and 45-46).

[48]                        These subsections underscore how the complainant’s words and actions are directly relevant to whether or not there was consent to the sexual activity in question. Based on the complainant’s evidence in the case at bar, she expressed, by words and conduct, a lack of agreement to engage in sexual intercourse without a condom. Section 273.1(2)(d) expressly reinforces that the clear rejection of a specific activity must be respected if consent is to have any meaning. Condom use cannot be irrelevant, secondary or incidental when the complainant has expressly conditioned her consent on its use. As stated by L’Heureux-Dubé J. in Ewanchuk, s. 273.1(2)(d) “acknowledges that when a woman says ‘no’ she is communicating her non-agreement, regardless of what the accused thought it meant, and that her expression has an enforceable legal effect” (para. 101).

[49]                        Recognizing that condom use may form part of the sexual activity in question is also the only way to respect the need for a complainant’s affirmative and subjective consent to each and every sexual act, every time. It not only affirms that individuals have the right to determine who touches their bodies and how; it situates condom use at the definitional core of consent, where it belongs. It is the only interpretation consistent with the foundational principles of consent expressed in s. 273.1 and this Court’s longstanding jurisprudence, including Hutchinson.

[50]                        Including condom use as part of the sexual activity in question properly places the focus at the doctrinal heart of the actus reus analysis: was there actual consent under s. 273.1? Since Ewanchuk, this Court has consistently emphasized the centrality of the complainant’s subjective perspective at the actus reus stage (J.A., at paras. 23 and 45-46; Barton, at paras. 87-89; G.F., at paras. 29 and 33). The assessment of consent under s. 273.1(1) is determined by reference to the complainant’s internal state of mind towards the touching, when it happened (Ewanchuk, at paras. 26 and 61). It is a purely subjective approach where the complainant’s individual perspective alone is determinative: they either consented or not (Ewanchuk, at paras. 27 and 31; J.A., at para. 23; Barton, at para. 89). The accused’s perspective is irrelevant at this stage (Barton, at paras. 87 and 89).

[51]                        According to the foundational principles of consent, the complainant’s reasons for granting or withholding consent and insisting on a condom are not relevant: “If the complainant did not subjectively consent (for whatever reason) then the actus reus is established” (G.F., at para. 33 (emphasis added)). That all persons are entitled to refuse sexual contact at any time, and for any reason, is a fundamental principle of Canadian sexual assault law (J.A., at para. 43; G.F., at para. 33). All persons “have an inherent right to exercise full control over their own bodies, and to engage only in sexual activity that they wish to engage in” (R. v. Park, 1995 CanLII 104 (SCC), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 836, at paras. 38 and 42; Ewanchuk, at para. 75, per L’Heureux‑Dubé J., concurring). Each person’s ability to set the boundaries and conditions under which they are prepared to be touched is grounded in concepts as important as physical inviolability, sexual autonomy and agency, human dignity and equality (Ewanchuk, at para. 28; G.F., at para. 1). As McLachlin C.J. explained in Mabior, the “modern understanding of sexual assault is based on the preservation of the right to refuse sexual intercourse: sexual assault is wrong because it denies the victim’s dignity as a human being”; fails to respect each sexual partner as an “autonomous, equal and free person”; and involves “the wrongful exploitation of another human being. To engage in sexual acts without the consent of another person is to treat him or her as an object and negate his or her human dignity” (paras. 45 and 48). See also J. McInnes and C. Boyle, “Judging Sexual Assault Law Against a Standard of Equality” (1995), 29 U.B.C. L. Rev. 341, at p. 353, fn. 30, and p. 357, fn. 38.

[52]                        The complainant’s “no” to sexual intercourse without a condom cannot be ignored under either s. 273.1(1) or (2) because “[t]oday, not only does no mean no, but only yes means yes” (R. v. Goldfinch, 2019 SCC 38, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 44). As a result, when a complainant states: “no, not without a condom”, our law of consent says, emphatically, this actually means “no”, and cannot be reinterpreted to become “yes, without a condom”.

[53]                        Voluntary agreement to sex with a condom cannot be taken to imply consent to sex without one as consent cannot be implied from the circumstances or the relationship between the accused and the complainant (J.A., at para. 47; Ewanchuk, at para. 31; G.F., at para. 32; Barton, at paras. 98 and 105). Nothing substitutes for the complainant’s actual consent to the sexual activity at the time it occurred, which involves the “conscious agreement of the complainant to engage in every sexual act in a particular encounter” (J.A., at para. 31). A complainant must agree to the specific sexual act since “agreement to one form of penetration is not agreement to any or all forms of penetration and agreement to sexual touching on one part of the body is not agreement to all sexual touching” (Hutchinson, at para. 54; R. v. Olotu, 2017 SCC 11, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 168, aff’g 2016 SKCA 84, 338 C.C.C. (3d) 321; R. v. Poirier, 2014 ABCA 59; R. v. Flaviano, 2014 SCC 14, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 270, aff’g 2013 ABCA 219, 309 C.C.C. (3d) 163).

[54]                        Likewise, an accused cannot ignore limits or “test the waters” during a second episode of intercourse to “see” if the complainant now consents to sex without a condom as consent must be specifically renewed and communicated for “each and every sexual act” (J.A., at para. 34; Barton, at para. 118). Implying consent revives the “mythical assumptions that when a woman says ‘no’ she is really saying ‘yes’, ‘try again’, or ‘persuade me’” (Ewanchuk, at para. 87, per L’Heureux-Dubé J.). Instead, as stated in Ewanchuk (at para. 52, per Major J.):

Common sense should dictate that, once the complainant has expressed her unwillingness to engage in sexual contact, the accused should make certain that she has truly changed her mind before proceeding with further intimacies. The accused cannot rely on the mere lapse of time or the complainant’s silence or equivocal conduct to indicate that there has been a change of heart and that consent now exists . . . .

[55]                        Placing required condom use outside the core definition of consent under s. 273.1 would undercut these principles and undermine Parliament’s goals. Too narrow a reading of sexual activity will deem a complainant to have consented in law when they did not subjectively agree to sex without a condom in fact. For some people — like the complainant in this case — the difference between using a condom or not means the difference between subjectively agreeing to the activity or refusing it. To ignore express physical boundaries when defining consent under s. 273.1 effectively repeals the need for subjective and affirmative consent. Deeming the complainant’s consent to intercourse without a condom, after she has specifically rejected this form of touching, comes close to reinstating the rejected doctrine of implied consent (see Ewanchuk, at para. 31; J.A., at para. 47; G.F., at para. 32; Barton, at paras. 98 and 105). Recognizing that when the complainant agreed to sexual intercourse with a condom, she was not agreeing to the different physical act of direct skin to skin contact without a condom is precisely what Major J. protected in Ewanchuk, when he stated that, “[h]aving control over who touches one’s body, and how, lies at the core of human dignity and autonomy” (para. 28; see also G.F., at para. 1).

(b)         It Is the Only Approach Consistent With Parliament’s Purpose of Promoting Sexual Autonomy and Equal Sexual Agency

[56]                        Recognizing that condom use may be part of the sexual activity in question best respects Parliament’s equality-seeking and dignity-promoting purposes and its desire to reflect the realities, rights and concerns of complainants. This approach is most respectful of Parliament’s aims as evidenced by the legislative history, the preamble to the 1992 amendments in which consent was first defined, the social context in which s. 273.1 was introduced, and the present problems associated with condom refusal and removal (1704604 Ontario Ltd. v. Pointes Protection Association, 2020 SCC 22, at paras. 6 and 14-15; Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 360, at paras. 5 and 37; Alberta (Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development) v. Cunningham, 2011 SCC 37, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 670, at paras. 18, 63 and 69; R. v. D.A.I., 2012 SCC 5, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 149, at paras. 30 and 38; R. v. Chartrand, 1994 CanLII 53 (SCC), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 864; R. v. Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, at paras. 49-51).

[57]                        Regrettably, the refusal or removal of a condom when one has been requested and required is not uncommon. In recent years, “non-consensual condom refusal or removal” has become the subject of social science research and increased societal recognition (R.F., at para. 79; I.F., Barbra Schlifer Commemorative Clinic (“Barbra Schlifer Factum”), at paras. 4 and 7-10, citing A. Brodsky, “‘Rape-Adjacent’: Imagining Legal Responses to Nonconsensual Condom Removal” (2017), 32 Colum. J. Gender & L. 183; A. Boadle, C. Gierer and S. Buzwell, “Young Women Subjected to Nonconsensual Condom Removal: Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Sexual Self-Perceptions” (2021), 27 Violence Against Women 1696; R. L. Latimer et al., Non-consensual condom removal, reported by patients at a sexual health clinic in Melbourne, Australia, in PLoS ONE, 13(12), December 26, 2018 (online); Czechowski et al.; M. Ahmad et al., “‘You Do It Without Their Knowledge.’ Assessing Knowledge and Perception of Stealthing among College Students” (2020), 17:10 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 3527 (online), at p. 6).

[58]                        Non-consensual condom refusal or removal involves a range of conduct employed to avoid using a condom with a partner who wants to use one. This includes the refusal to use a condom in the first place, whether the accused informs the complainant of their refusal or not. It also covers cases of “stealthing”, where the accused pretends to have put on a condom or secretly removes it. There are many forms of “condom use resistance” and they may involve using physical force, manipulation, threats and deception to obtain unprotected sex (R.F., at para. 79; see also paras. 80-85; Barbra Schlifer Factum, at paras. 6-11; I.F., West Coast Legal Education and Action Fund Association, at para. 7).

[59]                        Recent empirical studies indicate the rates of non-consensual condom refusal or removal may be very high (Latimer et al., at p. 11; Czechowski et al., at pp. 16 and 20-21). The Intervener Barbra Schlifer Commemorative Clinic notes that Canadian universities have begun to consider non-consensual condom refusal or removal in their sexual violence prevention policies (I.F., at para. 10, citing University of Ottawa, Policy 67b Prevention of Sexual Violence, December 9, 2019; St. Francis Xavier University, Sexual Violence Response Policy, February 1, 2020, at p. 4; Dalhousie University, Sexualized Violence Policy, June 25, 2019, at p. 5). 

[60]                        Non-consensual condom refusal or removal is experienced as and recognized as a form of sexual violence which generates various forms of harm. There are clear physical risks, but the psychological consequences are also very real. Women who have experienced non-consensual condom refusal or removal have been found to develop negative self-perception about their sexual agency and sometimes themselves (Boadle, Gierer and Buzwell, at p. 1708). Victims of non-consensual condom refusal or removal describe it as a “disempowering, demeaning violation of a sexual agreement”, a violation of consent, a betrayal of trust, a denial of autonomy, and an act of sexual violence (Brodsky, at pp. 184 and 186; Czechowski et al., at pp. 11-13; S. Lévesque and C. Rousseau, “Young Women’s Acknowledgment of Reproductive Coercion: A Qualitative Analysis” (2021), 36 J. of Interpers. Violence NP8200 (online), at p. NP8210). The complainant’s testimony — which we must take to be true at this preliminary stage — is clearly consistent with that research. She described the appellant’s conduct as “like, freaking rape, like, because — like, I said I only have sex with condoms” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 63).

[61]                        As with other forms of sexual coercion, the risk of experiencing non-consensual condom refusal or removal is not distributed equally throughout the population. The power dynamic it rests on is exacerbated among vulnerable women, including women living in poverty, racialized women, migrant women, and among people with diverse gender identities and sex workers (Barbra Schlifer Factum, at para. 9, citing K. T. Grace and J. C. Anderson, “Reproductive Coercion: A Systematic Review” (2018), 19 Trauma, Violence, & Abuse 371, at pp. 383-85). Younger women, who may agree to sexual activity only if protection is used in dating contexts or casual sexual relationships with partners they do not know well (as the facts of this case demonstrate), are also targets of non-consensual condom refusal or removal (Boadle, Gierer and Buzwell, at pp. 1706-7; see, e.g., R. v. Lupi, 2019 ONSC 3713; R. v. Rivera, 2019 ONSC 3918; R. v. Kraft, 2021 ONSC 1970). The phenomenon is also particularly associated with intimate partner violence (Barbra Schlifer Factum, at para. 9, citing Grace and Anderson, at p. 385).

[62]                        Sexual assault remains a highly gendered crime (Goldfinch, at paras. 37-38; Barton, at para. 1). Sexual violence disproportionately impacts women and gender diverse people, including trans and cisgender women and girls and other trans, non-binary, and Two Spirit people. This is even more true for racialized members of those communities (I.F., Women’s Legal Education and Action Fund Inc., at para. 18). I agree with the Attorney General of Alberta that a narrow interpretation of the sexual activity in question will have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups, contribute to sexual inequality and deny Canadians equality under the law (I.F., at para. 23). Where a complainant’s wishes are ignored by their partner, with or without deception, failing to recognize condom use as part of the sexual activity in question for the purposes of their consent would deny recognition of their sexual agency, equality and right to control over their reproductive and physical health and well-being (Barbra Schlifer Factum, at para. 17, citing E. C. Neilson et al., “Psychological Effects of Abuse, Partner Pressure, and Alcohol: The Roles of in-the-Moment Condom Negotiation Efficacy and Condom-Decision Abdication on Women’s Intentions to Engage in Condomless Sex” (2019), 36 J. of Interpers. Violence NP9416).

[63]                        Condom refusal or removal disproportionately affects women, but it can be experienced by any person and the sexual assault laws are designed to provide equal protection to all. The offence of sexual assault protects the inviolability of each and every individual, and is inextricable from notions of power and control. In addition to sex inequality, there can also be inequality in sex. Requiring a condom is an act of agency, but negotiating its use often takes place in circumstances of inequality. Who has the authority to insist and ultimately decide how their bodies will be touched is at the heart of human dignity and equal sexual agency. Disregarding a complainant’s insistence on a condom is both proof and practice of an unequal relationship. It allows one partner to appropriate to themself the ability to overrule the other partner’s conditions of consent. It is a clear exercise of dominance which shows a disregard for the other person’s ability to dictate the boundaries of their participation. Overruling the complainant’s insistence on the use of a condom is unlawful; an accused is not permitted to privilege his desire over her express limits and use her as a means to his sexual ends.

[64]                          The recognition that condom use when required is part of the sexual activity in question provides the requisite protection for everyone against illegal conduct which produces complex harms. Having control over how one’s body is touched must include the right to choose whether one’s body is penetrated by a bare penis or a condom-covered penis and to limit one’s consent accordingly. It is no different than having the right to choose whether one’s body is touched over or under clothing, penetrated by a digit or a sex toy, or where and how penetration may occur. Preventing a complainant from limiting consent to circumstances where a condom is used erodes the right to refuse or limit consent to specific sexual acts, leaving “the law of Canada seriously out of touch with reality, and dysfunctional in terms of its protection of sexual autonomy” (C.A. reasons, at para. 3).

(c)           The Fraud Framework Advanced by the Appellant

[65]                        Placing required condom use outside consent to the sexual activity in question in s. 273.1 threatens the foundational principles of consent and undermines Parliament’s goals. Yet, that is precisely what the appellant seeks when he proposes that the legal implications of his refusal to wear a condom are only to be analyzed under the fraud framework of s. 265(3)(c). While s. 265(3)(c) has a role to play in other cases, it is not well equipped to address cases of sexual assault based on an allegation of no consent to a different physical act — especially when the complainant has expressly rejected the specific sexual act in question. A comparison of the appellant’s alternative proposed pathway to liability shows how the general fraud provision in s. 265(3)(c) misses the mark when a sexual assault complainant says they did not consent to sexual intercourse without a condom.

[66]                        The appellant’s narrow reading of “sexual activity in question” will deem the complainant to have consented in law when she did not in fact subjectively agree to sex without a condom. She will be taken to have said yes to intercourse without a condom when she really said no. By contrast, including condom use as part of the sexual activity in question properly places the focus at the first stage of the actus reus analysis: was there actual consent under s. 273.1? 

[67]                        In this case the complainant’s evidence is clear — she repeatedly confirmed she did not consent to having sex without a condom at any time:

Q  So, in relation to the March 16, 2017 incident, did you consent to having sexual intercourse with Ross without a condom?

A  No.

Q  Did you want to have sexual intercourse without a condom?

A  No.

Q  So, between the first time you had sexual intercourse and the second time, at any point during that time did Ross ask you whether he could have sexual intercourse without a condom?

A  No.

Q  At any time did you tell him that he could have sexual intercourse with you without a condom?

A  No.

 

(A.R., vol. II, at p. 26)

[68]                        Under s. 273.1, this evidence, if believed, is sufficient to establish a lack of consent on her part to the sexual activity in question. Instead of asking whether she subjectively wanted the touching to take place, fraud shifts the focus to how the accused behaved and asks whether he attempted to, or succeeded in, deceiving the complainant about his lack of condom use. Indeed, according to the appellant, the complainant in this case is deemed to have consented under s. 273.1 to sexual intercourse without a condom despite the clear evidence she did not consent and the equally clear legal principle that what is required is her subjective agreement to that sexual act. The appellant further argues there can be no deception because he did not agree to wear a condom during the second act of intercourse.

[69]                        The requirement to prove deception and a deprivation misdirects the inquiry and creates gaps which leave many outside the law’s protection in relation to sexual assault. This may not be surprising, as the general requirements for fraud do not always respect or track the rationales of sexual autonomy, human dignity and equal sexual agency at the core of the sexual assault offences. In addition to this disconnect, there are many reasons why the approach advocated for by the appellant should not be adopted where the complainant has not agreed to sex without a condom.

[70]                        First, requiring proof of a deprivation fails to account for how, under our law of consent, all persons are able to decide to consent or not based on whatever grounds are personally meaningful to them. Under s. 273.1, the law has no interest in why a person gave or withheld consent as their thoughts, motivations and desires are private. What matters is whether there was or was not subjective consent in fact. This respect for individual choice, and the personal motivations underlying it, lies at the core of sexual agency. Requiring a complainant who has insisted on condom use to prove a deprivation before consent is vitiated is inconsistent with the foundational principle that people are entitled to refuse consent regardless of their motivation. The complainant may insist on a condom for “whatever reason” is meaningful to them — whether or not it is based on the risk of pregnancy or STIs or has any relationship with the law’s view of a significant risk of serious bodily harm (G.F., at paras. 29 and 33). In the court below, Groberman J.A. was correct to point out, at para. 28, that “[s]uch a limitation on the definition of ‘the sexual activity in question’ would be perverse, as it would, without any rationale, prevent a person from limiting their consent in a manner that is intimately related to their personal autonomy and the public interest”.

[71]                        Second, the harms of non-consensual condom refusal or removal go beyond a significant risk of serious bodily harm and are so much wider than the risk of pregnancy and STIs. Constructing the harm as equivalent only to its “physical” or “bodily” consequences “inhibits legal recognition of how [it] is experienced as harmful and degrading because it transgresses the limits of consent to the sexual activity in question” (L. Gotell and I. Grant, “Non-Consensual Condom Removal in Canadian Law Before and After R. v. Hutchinson” (2021), 44 Dal. L.J. 439, at p. 442). It reinforces the myth that “real rape” is defined by physical violence, beyond the violence of non-consensual touching (Gotell and Grant, at p. 456). As L’Heureux-Dubé J. emphasized in Cuerrier, the essence of the offence is the violation of the complainant’s physical dignity in a manner contrary to their autonomous will and that violation is what justifies criminal sanction, regardless of the risk or degree of serious bodily harm involved (paras. 18-19).

[72]                        Third, the harm requirement for fraud also means that certain people and certain types of sex would not come within the law’s protection. The recognition of one’s security of the person and equality should not depend upon whether a particular complainant is capable of becoming pregnant or whether the sex act involved carries either the risk of pregnancy or the transmission of STIs.

[73]                        Fourth, proving a significant risk of serious bodily harm will likely entail a patronizing assessment of whether the harm the complainant experienced was significant enough to vitiate a consent that, in their mind, was never given. Establishing deprivation may be highly invasive for complainants. In addition to explaining the circumstances of their violation, they must establish that they suffered a significant risk of serious bodily harm beyond the indignity of being assaulted. The deprivation requirement focuses on intensely personal, sensitive or stigmatizing information about a complainant’s unwanted pregnancy, abortion, fertility, menopausal status, contraception practices, STIs, assigned sex at birth (where it affects fertility), and possibly mental health. Each of these categories of information may speak to either or both of the complainant’s pre-existing vulnerability to pregnancy and/or STIs and the ultimate question of whether the accused’s conduct actually caused the complainant harm (or risk thereof). These factors are not relevant to consent under s. 273.1 and yet play a prominent, even a determinative role under s. 265(3).

[74]                        Sexual assault law, based on s. 273.1, protects the complainant’s choice, regardless of her reasons for requiring a condom. There is no need to overcome the strictures of fraud by giving a wide definition to deception, by covering undisclosed condom refusal under the dishonesty requirement, or by finding that damage to dignitary interests qualifies as a significant risk of serious bodily harm. Parliament enacted its robust definition of consent under s. 273.1 in part because the general vitiation provision in s. 265(3) for all assaults was insufficient in the specific context of sexual assault. The direct route of asking whether there was subjective consent to the physically different act under s. 273.1 is better on every measure: it is what Parliament intended, it is logically prior, more respectful of complainants, substantively superior, and goes to the core of the statutory definition designed to address sexual violence and its consequences. It is Parliament’s preferred provision for responding to consent violations because it is more specific than the fraud provision and newer (R. Sullivan, Statutory Interpretation (3rd ed. 2016), at pp. 327-28).

[75]                        The “sexual activity in question”, properly interpreted, is sufficiently broad to capture physical aspects that were crucial to the complainant’s agreement to the specific touching in the first place. The determination of whether no consent has been given to the distinct physical act of unprotected skin-to-skin sex should not depend on the manner in which a person’s consent has been violated. In cases of condom refusal or removal, the fraud analysis draws attention away from the foundational principles of consent, focuses attention elsewhere, and creates gaps in coverage antithetical to Parliament’s intention to address the rights, realities and harms of sexual violence. All the basic principles of statutory interpretation and consent law support the common-sense proposition that sexual intercourse with a condom is a different sexual activity from sexual intercourse without a condom.

(4)         The Hutchinson Decision Is Not Determinative

[76]                        The appellant nevertheless argues that this Court is bound to employ the fraud pathway based on his reading of Hutchinson. He specifically relies on paras. 41, 55 and 64 to argue that condoms should always be excluded from the sexual activity in question because they are a contraceptive (A.F., at paras. 21-23 and 26). He submits that the majority in Hutchinson expressly rejected the “distinction between a faulty condom and the absence of a condom” in the sexual activity in question analysis (A.F., at para. 26). He also invokes the minority’s clarification as to their disagreement with the majority to confirm his interpretation (Hutchinson, at para. 97; A.F., at para. 27). I disagree. Hutchinson does not have the broad application he suggests: the decision did not establish mandatory rules for all future cases involving a condom.

[77]                        In this section, I first set out the case in Hutchinson and then explain why it does not govern the case at bar in which no condom was used.

(a)           The Case

[78]                        In Hutchinson, this Court addressed how the law should approach consent where an accused intentionally sabotaged the condom he was required to use during intercourse. In that case, the complainant and the accused were in a rather rocky long-term intimate relationship. She repeatedly told him that she did not want to get pregnant and therefore insisted on condom use. Mr. Hutchinson instead wanted to get her pregnant, hoping their relationship could continue. While the complainant consented to sexual intercourse with a condom, he had, unbeknownst to her, poked holes in it, rendering it ineffective as a means of birth control (para. 2; see also R. v. Hutchinson, 2011 NSSC 361, 311 N.S.R. (2d) 1, at para. 2; R. v. Hutchinson, 2013 NSCA 1, 325 N.S.R. (2d) 95, at para. 3). The majority held that the complainant’s consent had been vitiated by fraud under s. 265(3), while the minority held that she had not agreed to the “sexual activity in question” under s. 273.1(1) (paras. 74 and 103).

[79]                        The majority rejected an approach that placed condom sabotage under s. 273.1 for three reasons. First, they held that Parliament did not intend to expand the notion of sexual activity by including “potentially infinite collateral conditions” (para. 27). They said the ordinary meaning of the “sexual activity in question” is the specific physical sex act agreed to (for example, “kissing, petting, oral sex, intercourse, or the use of sex toys”) and this “does not include conditions or qualities of the physical act, such as birth control measures or the presence of sexually transmitted diseases” (paras. 54-55). Second, the majority wanted to avoid putting the outcomes of Cuerrier and Mabior, which established when HIV non-disclosure could amount to fraud, at risk (paras. 29 and 42-43). Third, they sought to avoid a vague and unclear test for consent that could result in criminalizing conduct lacking the necessary reprehensible character before criminal sanctions are warranted (paras. 21 and 45-46).

[80]                        Applying the law to the facts, the majority held that the “sexual activity in question” was sexual intercourse and the complainant voluntarily agreed to it (paras. 64-65). However, the complainant’s consent had been vitiated by fraud because the test set out in Cuerrier and Mabior was satisfied: the dishonesty was evident and admitted, and there had been a sufficiently serious deprivation in the form of exposure to an increased risk of becoming pregnant (Hutchinson, at paras. 68 and 71).

[81]                        The minority was of the view that the complainant only agreed to sexual intercourse with an intact condom. It followed that there was no consent under s. 273.1(1) as the sexual activity was not carried out in the manner agreed to (paras. 101 and 103).

(b)         Hutchinson Is Distinguishable and Does Not Apply When No Condom Was Used

[82]                        Hutchinson is a classic case of deception in which the accused deliberately made holes in the condom hoping that pregnancy would result. It simply held that cases involving condom sabotage and deceit should be analyzed under the fraud provision rather than as part of the sexual activity in question in s. 273.1. Read properly, and consistently with well-established principles for stare decisis, Hutchinson was chiefly concerned with the delineation of deception under the criminal law. The majority’s statements addressed the particular context of condom sabotage and did not intend to displace the fundamental principle, grounded in physical integrity and human dignity, that the law allows all persons to insist on condom use as part of consent and thereby limit who may touch them and how.

[83]                        Hutchinson did not establish the sweeping proposition that all cases involving a condom fall outside s. 273.1 and can only be addressed, if at all, when the conditions of fraud are established. As this new case at bar demonstrates, condom use is not always collateral or incidental to the sexual activity in question. Indeed, conditioning agreement to sexual touching on condom use goes to the heart of the specific physical activity in question and the existence or non-existence of subjective consent, and there is no need to resort to the doctrine of fraud and its stringent legal requirements in this circumstance. Hutchinson thus remains binding authority for what it decided, but it does not apply to when the accused refuses to wear a condom and the complainant’s consent has been conditioned on its use.

[84]                        I explain my conclusion that Hutchinson does not apply this widely in two parts. First, the majority’s decision in Hutchinson is limited by its factual context and the majority’s repeated references to the effectiveness of the condom, its sabotaged state and the accused’s deception. The majority was not deciding the legal framework relating to the total absence of a condom or other forms of non-consensual condom refusal or removal. Second, I set out why, when considered in this light, the paragraphs the appellant relies on do not support his interpretation.

(i)            The Factual Context in Hutchinson and the Majority’s Framing of the Issue on Appeal

[85]                        Cases are only authorities for what they “actually decide[d]”; they are not “statutes where every word counts as binding legal authority” (R. J. Sharpe, Good Judgment: Making Judicial Decisions (2018), at p. 148). The facts of Hutchinson and the particular legal issue raised limit what was decided in that case and how widely its dicta should be read. There, as here, the complainant premised her consent to sexual intercourse on condom use. Unlike the case at bar, Mr. Hutchinson had used a condom and the complainant knew he had done so. The sexual activity in question therefore involved the very physical touching she authorized — sexual intercourse with a penis sheathed in a condom — but the problem arose because he had sabotaged the condom. This is a substantial and materially different fact; it goes not to whether or not a condom was used but rather whether the condom was effective for birth control. This is important context in which to understand the majority’s interpretation of the “sexual activity in question” in s. 273.1.

[86]                        Faced with a clear case of deception as to the condom’s condition, the majority in Hutchinson framed the legal issue as whether “condom sabotage” should result in no consent under s. 273.1(1) of the Criminal Code, or whether “condom sabotage” should be analyzed under the fraud provision (para. 14). It was the “condom sabotage” that the majority held to constitute fraud under s. 265(3)(c) “with the result that no consent was obtained” (para. 6). Mr. Hutchinson’s actual use of a condom when one was required allowed the Court to find that the complainant subjectively consented to the sexual activity in question and to state the question before them as whether, despite this “apparent agreement”, the complainant’s consent was vitiated “because that agreement was obtained as a result of Mr. Hutchinson’s deceit about the condition of the condom” (para. 17; see also para. 3).

[87]                        The focus on his deceptive use of a sabotaged condom weaves through the majority’s analysis, including in its overview of sexual autonomy in criminal law (at para. 19) and in introducing its statutory interpretation analysis (para. 20). Notably, their consideration of this Court’s jurisprudence in the statutory interpretation exercise deals only with cases relating to the fraud provision: Cuerrier and Mabior. Their discussion of previous interpretations of the fraud provision highlights difficulties drawing the line “between deceptions that did and did not vitiate consent” (para. 30). The analysis is centred on fraud and does not consider this Court’s jurisprudence on consent or purport to overrule it.

(ii)         The Paragraphs the Appellant Relies on Do Not Support His Interpretation

[88]                        I do not accept that the paragraphs of the majority judgment in Hutchinson, as interpreted and relied on by the appellant in this case, support his argument that his failure to wear a condom can only be analyzed under s. 265(3) as a potential case of fraud. Taken in context, whether alone or in combination, these paragraphs do not preclude the failure to wear a condom from being considered under s. 273.1. In its analysis, the majority in Hutchinson often used the qualifier “effective” or “sabotaged” when discussing condom use and other birth control measures (see, e.g., paras. 44, 48 and 64). The majority does not explicitly say that condom non-use should be analyzed through the same lens as condom sabotage or ineffective birth control. The issue of condom non-use as a material fact was not before the Court in Hutchinson.

[89]                        Significant attention has been paid to para. 55 of Hutchinson:

The “sexual activity in question” does not include conditions or qualities of the physical act, such as birth control measures or the presence of sexually transmitted diseases. Thus, at the first stage of the consent analysis, the Crown must prove a lack of subjective voluntary agreement to the specific physical sex act. Deceptions about conditions or qualities of the physical act may vitiate consent under s. 265(3)(c) of the Criminal Code, if the elements for fraud are met.

[90]                        This statement could be read as always excluding condoms from the “sexual activity in question” because condoms may be used as a birth control measure. But it need not and should not be read in this unnecessarily expansive manner. The majority’s opinion does not preclude treating effective condom use and condom non-use differently. The majority’s analysis leading up to this paragraph is focused on the delineation of fraud or deception in a case concerning a sabotaged condom. I agree with Groberman J.A. in the court below that properly interpreted in its context, para. 55 of Hutchinson holds that birth control measures may be “conditions or qualities of the physical act” where they do not inherently change the physical act itself. However, where they do change the physical act itself, like condom use, they may fall under s. 273.1. By reading Hutchinson in this way, I do not alter the meaning attributed to s. 273.1 by the majority of the Court, determined as it was for the purpose of disposing of the different matter at issue in that case. The interpretation and scope of this paragraph must consider the reasoning behind the majority’s differentiation between the physical act itself and other “conditions or qualities”, which formed the basis for its exclusion of contraceptive measures and the presence of STIs from the sexual activity in question (Hutchinson, at paras. 5 and 55). This distinction stemmed from the concern that the minority’s approach — premised on the efficacy of the condom — would be unclear, cause over-criminalization, render the fraud provision “redundant in many cases” and undermine Cuerrier and Mabior (Hutchinson, at paras. 5, 21, 26, 29 and 39-46). The majority’s discussion of the problems with the minority’s approach, however, does not suggest that condom use, as an element of the physical act, carries these same problems (Hutchinson, at paras. 39-45).

[91]                        The Hutchinson majority held that “the ‘sexual activity in question’ was the sexual intercourse that took place in th[at] case” and effective condom use was “a method of contraception and protection against sexually transmitted disease”, not a “sex act” (para. 64). As there was “no dispute that the complainant subjectively consented to sexual intercourse with Mr. Hutchinson at the time it occurred”, the Crown had failed to prove a lack consent under s. 273.1(1) (para. 65).

[92]                        These statements do not help the appellant. Crucially, the complainant had subjectively consented to “the sexual intercourse that took place in th[at] case” because Mr. Hutchinson wore a condom. What the Court was addressing was effective condom use, which presupposes the use of a condom. The Court should not be taken as saying that requiring the use of a condom can never be part of the sex act. The position that an “effective condom” was a method of contraception is once again tied to the facts at hand: a condom was used, but had been sabotaged by deception in a situation where the complainant was particularly concerned with the risk of conception.

[93]                        Finally, I am not persuaded that the majority took the position that no condom and sabotaged condoms were the same in para. 41 of Hutchinson. This paragraph does not speak to the absence of a condom. Rather, it sets out why the majority says adopting the “‘essential features’”/“‘how the act was carried out’” approaches (taken in the court below and by the minority judges) would make the law “inconsistent, highly formalistic and unduly uncertain”. It says the law should provide consistent treatment to a lie that obtains consent to unprotected sex and a lie as to the condition of a condom. However, the first lie relates to something other than the sexual activity in question because it causes the complainant to subjectively agree to unprotected sex (rather than causing the complainant to unwittingly have sex without a condom when she only agreed to sex with a condom). In the second example, the lie has to do with the state of the condom. This lie is about whether the condom is effective at preventing STI transmission or pregnancy, not about the sexual activity in question. It follows, for example, that fraud would be the proper approach to analyzing (1) a lie about STI status that leads the complainant to agree to have unprotected sex, and (2) a lie about the physical integrity of the condom. This paragraph treats these lies as similar, but it does not preclude actions that go to the core of the complainant’s conditioned consent from forming part of the sexual activity in question.

[94]                        Critically, nowhere in the judgment does the Court address the total absence of a condom in circumstances where consent was conditional on its use. In speaking of the specific physical sex act, they did not say that as a matter of law, condom use is never a physical aspect of the sexual activity in question. At no point did the majority convey any intention to overrule or modify the foundational principles of affirmative and subjective consent. Indeed, McLachlin C.J. and Cromwell J., writing for the majority, not only referred to Ewanchuk, they highlighted its primacy by introducing its basic principles in the very first paragraph of Hutchinson. They also explained that the complainant must agree to the “specific physical sex act” because “agreement to one form of penetration is not agreement to any or all forms of penetration and agreement to sexual touching on one part of the body is not agreement to all sexual touching” (para. 54). Hutchinson did not displace this Court’s well-established jurisprudence on the law of sexual assault and consent. Consistent with this jurisprudence, the majority undoubtedly would not have found that the complainant gave her voluntary agreement to unprotected sex had Mr. Hutchinson refused to wear a condom or removed it without her knowledge.

[95]                        The appellant relied on the minority reasons to support his expansive interpretation of what Hutchinson decided. I need not address these arguments because what the minority says is not the law and what the minority said about the majority judgment is also not the law. Neither bind this Court.

[96]                        To read Hutchinson as broadly as the appellant suggests would radically constrain the scope and centrality of consent under s. 273.1, and in a manner wholly inconsistent with this Court’s jurisprudence on consent both before and after it. Based on the appellant’s broad interpretation of Hutchinson, we heard argument from the respondent Crown, and the interveners the Attorneys General of Ontario and Alberta; the Barbra Schlifer Commemorative Clinic; the West Coast Legal Education and Action Fund Association; and the Women’s Legal Education and Action Fund Inc. asking us to overrule, revise or revisit the Hutchinson decision.

[97]                        In my view, it is not necessary to take this step because Hutchinson does not govern a case where consent turns on condom use and no condom is worn. The decision should not be read as widely as the appellant contends. To be clear, I am distinguishing Hutchinson, not overruling it. Again, the majority in Hutchinson did not explicitly consider the difference between condom non-use and condom sabotage, nor did they speak to the impact that such a difference would have on the interpretation of ss. 265(3) and 273.1(2). My analysis, which examines this distinction because it is material to the facts in this appeal, is grounded in the time-honoured tradition of interpreting the scope of a previous decision. This method is described by some scholars as “restrictive distinguishing” (see, e.g., G. Williams and A. T. H. Smith, Glanville Williams: Learning the Law (17th ed. 2020), at pp. 83-85; N. Duxbury, The Nature and Authority of Precedent (2008), at p. 114; D. Parkes, “Precedent Unbound? Contemporary Approaches to Precedent in Canada” (2006), 32 Man. L.J. 135, at pp. 141-42). It leaves the previous precedent in place and, in my respectful view, is consonant “with the basic fundamental principle that the common law develops by experience” (R. v. Henry, 2005 SCC 76, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 609, at para. 57).

[98]                        Hutchinson’s interpretation of the relevant sections of the Criminal Code remains the law. This is based on a restrictive distinguishing between effective condom use and non-use, in light of the ineffective condom use that was a material fact in issue in that case. The Criminal Code was not, however, interpreted in light of the material fact of non-use of a condom that is central to the outcome of this appeal. Instead, I propose an interpretation of s. 273.1 in respect of material facts not ruled upon in Hutchinson.

(5)         Summary and Application

[99]                        At the actus reus stage of sexual assault, placing a condition of condom use on consent defines the sexual activity voluntarily agreed to under s. 273.1. The “sexual activity” to which the complainant must consent may include the use of condoms.

[100]                     The question of whether condom use forms part of the sexual activity in question depends on the facts and whether it is a condition of the complainant’s consent in those particular circumstances. As explained in Ewanchuk (at paras. 29-30), this will require the trier of fact to consider the complainant’s testimony and assess their credibility in light of all the evidence.

[101]                     Recognizing that condom use may form part of the sexual activity in question not only brings clarity and consistency to the law, it leaves intact the careful limits set out in Cuerrier and Mabior in relation to the non-disclosure of HIV. Nothing in this approach impacts the criminalization of people living with HIV, unless they fail to respect their partner’s condition of condom use.

[102]                     Where condom use is a condition of the complainant’s consent to the sexual activity in question, it will form part of the “sexual activity in question” and the consent analysis under s. 273.1. If the actus reus is established, the focus will shift to the mens rea. If the accused is mistaken and has not been reckless or willfully blind to the complainant’s consent, and has taken reasonable steps to ascertain this consent, they may be able to put forward a defence at the mens rea stage of the analysis (s. 273.2; Ewanchuk, at paras. 25, 47 and 49; J.A., at para. 42; Barton, at paras. 90-94). The trier of fact will be the best placed to assess in light of the evidence whether a condom was removed in ignorance of the complainant’s conditioned consent, or whether, for example, it accidentally fell off without the accused noticing.

[103]                     In cases involving condoms, Hutchinson applies where the complainant finds out after the sexual act that the accused was wearing a knowingly sabotaged condom. Hutchinson remains good law and applies only to cases of deception, for example where a condom is used, but rendered ineffective through an act of sabotage and deception. If the complainant finds out during the sexual act that the condom was sabotaged, then they can revoke their subjective consent, the actus reus of sexual assault is made out, and there is no need to consider the fraud analysis.

[104]                     Recognizing that condom use can be part of the sexual activity in question is not an expansion of s. 273.1 and does not offend the principle of restraint in criminal law. Parliament has stated repeatedly that it is criminally reprehensible conduct to impose an unconsented-to sexual act on an unwilling or unwitting victim. Non-consensual condom refusal or removal is a form of sexual violence that generates harms and undermines the equality, autonomy, and human dignity of complainants. It is not simply “undesirable” behaviour (trial reasons, at para. 30).

[105]                     There are also no vagueness or certainty concerns if condom use, including non-consensual condom refusal or removal, is seen as part of the sexual activity in question. Asking whether a condom was required and if so, whether one was used has the necessary certainty to prevent over-criminalization. While restraint is an important criminal law principle, it does not override Parliament’s countervailing imperative of enacting sexual assault laws that respect the rights and realities of those subject to such violence. Excluding such physical aspects from the sexual activity in question would leave an avoidable and undesirable gap in the law of sexual assault, where certain violations of a complainant’s physical integrity and equal sexual agency are demoted as less worthy of protection. This runs contrary to the fundamental principle that a complainant’s motives for only agreeing to sex with a condom are irrelevant.

[106]                     The complainant’s evidence in this case was clear: she would not consent to having sex with the appellant without a condom, but the appellant nevertheless chose to engage in sexual intercourse without one. Therefore, there was some evidence that the complainant did not subjectively consent to the sexual activity in question. The trial judge erred in concluding otherwise.

B.            Evidence of Fraud

[107]                     Given my conclusion on the first issue, it is not necessary to consider the second issue of whether there was evidence capable of meeting the requirements to establish fraud under s. 265(3)(c).

V.           Conclusion

[108]                     For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal and uphold the order of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia setting aside the acquittal and ordering a new trial.

III.  Disposition

I.               Overview

[109]                     We agree with our colleague Martin J. on the proper disposition of this appeal. We, too, would dismiss Mr. Kirkpatrick’s appeal and uphold the order of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia for a new trial.

[110]                     We also broadly and emphatically agree with our colleague’s summary, at paras. 26‑35, of Canadian sexual assault law. No means only no; and only yes means yes. Consent to sexual activity requires nothing less than positive affirmation. In this way, our law strives to safeguard bodily integrity and sexual autonomy for all.

[111]                     But that is not what this appeal is about. This appeal asks whether this Court may interpret the same provision of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, twice, in radically different ways, without overturning itself. Our colleague says it can. We say it cannot.

[112]                     At stake here, however, is not only the coherence of our jurisprudence on this issue, but the methodology by which judicial authority is exercised at this Court.

[113]                     Our reasons proceed in four parts. First, we show that R. v. Hutchinson, 2014 SCC 19, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 346, governs the very issue now before this Court. The Hutchinson majority held, categorically, that condom use is not part of “the sexual activity in question” contemplated in s. 273.1(1) of the Criminal Code. When a person agrees to have sex on the condition that their partner wear a condom, but that condition is circumvented in any way, the sole pathway to criminal liability is the fraud vitiating consent analysis under s. 265(3)(c).

[114]                     This is precisely what occurred between Mr. Kirkpatrick and the complainant in this case. As we will explain, we are bound — as is our colleague — to apply Hutchinson. Yet, our colleague treats the matter of which framework to use — s. 273.1(1) or s. 265(3)(c) — as an open question that Hutchinson did not resolve. She addresses this binding precedent only secondarily, and towards the conclusion of her reasons, and gives short shrift to this Court’s definitive answer to the very question raised in this appeal. In doing so, our colleague superimposes the Hutchinson minority’s view onto this settled legal question, despite correctly pointing out that “what the minority says is not the law” (para. 95).

[115]                     And even were our colleague not bound by Hutchinson, she neither acknowledges nor accounts for how her proposed re-interpretation of s. 273.1(1) opens the door to over-criminalization, the burden of which is likely to fall disproportionately on the same marginalized communities she claims to defend. It is, after all, precisely the interpretation that our colleague now revives from the minority reasons in Hutchinson that was rejected by the majority as failing to strike the proper balance between protecting sexual autonomy and ensuring the “blunt instrument” of the criminal law is applied with certainty and restraint (para. 18). The unsustainable distinction that our colleague draws to escape Hutchinson skates over the risk of over‑criminalization that the majority in Hutchinson identified in the minority judges’ approach. Our colleague sweeps aside the “principled and clear line between criminal and non-criminal conduct” achieved in Hutchinson, which ensured that the failure to respect a partner’s conditioning of sex on condom use is criminalized only where it is both dishonest and potentially harmful to the complainant (para. 49).

[116]                     Second, as Hutchinson cannot be distinguished, it must either be applied or overturned. In claiming that Hutchinson is factually distinguishable, our colleague avoids the difficult work of determining whether Hutchinson should be overturned. To fairly assess whether Hutchinson can be overturned, we examined all of this Court’s horizontal stare decisis jurisprudence since the introduction of the Constitution Act, 1982. We underscore that stare decisis is fundamental to legal stability, judicial legitimacy, and the rule of law. We also synthesize the common themes that emerge from our jurisprudence and articulate a test for assessing whether this Court can overturn a prior precedent. In sum, this Court can only overturn its own precedents if that precedent (1) was rendered per incuriam, (2) is unworkable, or (3) has had its foundation eroded by significant societal or legal change.

[117]                     Third, applying our horizontal stare decisis framework, we conclude that Hutchinson meets none of the criteria for overturning precedent. It therefore governs the case at bar, such that the fraud vitiating consent analysis under s. 265(3)(c) is engaged, rather than the consent analysis under s. 273.1(1).

[118]                     Finally, applying Hutchinson to the present case, we conclude there is some evidence that the complainant consented to the sexual activity in question, but that a new trial is required to determine whether her apparent consent was vitiated by fraud.

II.            Analysis

A.           Hutchinson Applies to This Appeal

[119]                     Our colleague treats the legal effect of the appellant’s “failure to wear a condom” as an open question, and suggests the answer to this question is unresolved in the jurisprudence (para. 25). She contends that, based on “well-established principles” of stare decisis, Hutchinson is a case “chiefly concerned with the delineation of deception under the criminal law” (para. 82). She says the ratio decidendi of Hutchinson relates solely to “sabotaged” condoms, not the absence of a condom (paras. 84‑87). Hutchinson is, she says, “a classic case of deception” (para. 82). She says that this Court did not canvas the broader issues of a refusal to wear a condom or non-consensual condom removal (at para. 85), and, as such, Hutchinson “did not establish mandatory rules for all future cases involving a condom” (para. 76).

[120]                     None of this is remotely so. Indeed, it is demonstrably to the contrary. As we will explain, the case at bar is indistinguishable from Hutchinson for several reasons. First, the binding ratio of all the decisions of the Court, as an apex court, is necessarily wider than our colleague acknowledges, undermining her attempt to confine Hutchinson to its particular facts. Second, the interpretation of Hutchinson she advances is contradicted by a plain reading of the decision, by the Hutchinson minority opinion, and by Hutchinson’s treatment by courts across the country. Third, the distinction our colleague would draw between Hutchinson and the case at bar is both incoherent and illogical. And finally, we say, respectfully but adamantly, it follows from the foregoing that our colleague’s attempt to “distinguish” Hutchinson, in substance, effects an overturning of that precedent. Although the facts are “bound to change in every case”, as our colleague says (at para. 40), the applicable legal framework does not. With respect, our colleague claims her analysis is “grounded in the time-honoured tradition of interpreting the scope of a previous decision” (para. 97), when she in fact overturns Hutchinson, if not in form then in substance.

(1)         This Court’s Decisions Are Intended to Apply Broadly

[121]                     Our colleague purports to distinguish Hutchinson by narrowly confining it to its highly unusual facts. While the facts of Hutchinson included a sabotaged condom (as opposed to no condom at all), the ratio of Hutchinson, as is typical of all cases decided at this Court, is broader than its facts. Our colleague’s methodology is wholly inconsistent with this Court’s established jurisprudence on interpreting the binding ratio of its decisions. She reinterprets Hutchinson on the narrow basis that the decision is “limited by its factual context” involving a sabotaged condom (para. 84). As we will explain, her emphasis on these aspects of the majority reasons overlooks the principles to be applied to ascertain the ratio of a case.

[122]                     Not all judicial decisions are created equal. The breadth of a decision’s ratio varies according to the level of court rendering it. While trial courts are rarely called upon to break new legal ground, intermediate appellate court decisions, generally speaking, concern the application of a point of law to the facts found by the trial court. This reflects the respective roles of the lower courts within our common law system (see, e.g., D. J. M. Brown, with the assistance of D. Fairlie, Civil Appeals (loose‑leaf), at §§ 1:1‑1:7; Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at paras. 11‑18; R. v. R.P., 2012 SCC 22, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 746; Ledcor Construction Ltd. v. Northbridge Indemnity Insurance Co., 2016 SCC 37, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 23, at paras. 35‑36; Salomon v. Matte-Thompson, 2019 SCC 14, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 729, at paras. 105‑8, per Côté J., dissenting, but not on this point).

[123]                     By contrast, apex courts consider broader legal questions (Brown, at § 1:7; B. Laskin, “The Role and Functions of Final Appellate Courts: The Supreme Court of Canada” (1975), 53 Can. Bar Rev. 469, at p. 475; Housen, at para. 9; Bhasin v. Hrynew, 2014 SCC 71, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 494, at para. 34). The decisions of this Court “resonate through the legal system” by enunciating, as they often do, general principles meant to apply broadly to the system as a whole (P. Daly, “Introduction”, in P. Daly, ed., Apex Courts and the Common Law (2019), 3, at pp. 4‑5; M. Rowe and L. Katz, “A Practical Guide to Stare Decisis” (2020), 41 Windsor Rev. Legal Soc. Issues 1, at p. 9). Accordingly, where this Court “turns its full attention to an issue and deals with it definitively”, its “guidance . . . should be treated as binding”, even where those comments were not strictly necessary for resolving the particular facts of that case (Rowe and Katz, at p. 10).

[124]                     Indeed, where once it was thought that “a case is only an authority for what it actually decides”, identifying the ratio of a decision of a modern apex court is a more expansive undertaking (R. v. Henry, 2005 SCC 76, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 609, at para. 53; Daly, at p. 4). Apex courts do not merely resolve individual cases; they expound general principles intended to guide — and bind — lower courts. The institutional position of our Court thus precludes an unduly narrow understanding of the law as we pronounce it, confined to the facts of each individual case. It requires instead a broader approach that produces general legal principles with the power to “unify large areas of the law and provide meaningful guidance to the legal community” (Daly, at pp. 4‑5). For example, this Court’s decision in R. v. Oakes, 1986 CanLII 46 (SCC), [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, stands for more than the proposition that s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑1, is unconstitutional. As such, it is not open to this Court to reinvent the framework of analysis for s. 1 of the Charter each time a constitutional appeal arises with facts different from those in Oakes.

[125]                     Despite the foregoing, our colleague, as we say, maintains that “[c]ases are only authorities for what they ‘actually decide[d]’” (para. 85). But this view, stated over 120 years ago by the Earl of Halsbury L.C. at the House of Lords in Quinn v. Leathem, [1901] A.C. 495, at p. 506, has been explicitly rejected by this Court. Indeed, in Henry, Binnie J., writing for the Court, explained at length, at para. 53, why this obsolete approach of the Lord Chancellor Halsbury and our colleague no longer applies:

The caution [that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides] was important at the time, of course, because the House of Lords did not then claim the authority to review and overrule its own precedents. This is no longer the case. . . . In Canada in the 1970s, the challenge became more acute when this Court’s mandate became oriented less to error correction and more to development of the jurisprudence (or . . . to deal with questions of “public importance”). The amendments to the Supreme Court Act had two effects relevant to this question. Firstly, the Court took fewer appeals, thus accepting fewer opportunities to discuss a particular area of the law, and some judges felt that “we should make the most of the opportunity by adopting a more expansive approach to our decision-making role”: B. Wilson, “Decision-making in the Supreme Court” (1986), 36 U.T.L.J. 227, at p. 234. Secondly, and more importantly, much of the Court’s work (particularly under the Charter) required the development of a general analytical framework which necessarily went beyond what was essential for the disposition of the particular case. . . . It would be a foolhardy advocate who dismissed Dickson C.J.’s classic formulation of proportionality in Oakes as mere obiter. Thus if we were to ask “what Oakes actually decides”, we would likely offer a more expansive definition in the post‑Charter period than the Earl of Halsbury L.C. would have recognized a century ago. [Emphasis added.]

[126]                     We agree with Binnie J.’s statement that the “strict and tidy demarcation” between the narrow ratio decidendi of a case, which is binding, and obiter, which is not, is an “oversimplification” of how the law develops (Henry, at para. 52). The legal point decided by the Court may be narrow or broad, depending on its proximity to the ratio of the case. The focus remains on the words this Court uses in its reasons, read in the context of the decision as a whole, as well as “the basic fundamental principle” that the law “develops by experience” (Henry, at para. 57).

[127]                     That said, in statutory interpretation cases, the context of the decision as a whole must not stray beyond its appropriate limits. While context remains relevant, it cannot be used to achieve different outcomes for different litigants. Statutory interpretation of Criminal Code provisions engages questions of law, which must be answered consistently for all types of offenders. For example, the meaning of “the sexual activity in question” cannot differ from one offender to the next. The ratio decidendi of a decision is a statement of law, not facts, and “[q]uestions of law forming part of the ratio . . . of a decision are binding . . . as a matter of stare decisis” (Edmonton (City) v. Edmonton East (Capilano) Shopping Centres Ltd., 2016 SCC 47, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 293, at para. 71, per Côté and Brown JJ., dissenting, but not on this point; R. v. Arcand, 2010 ABCA 363, 264 C.C.C. (3d) 134, at para. 413, per Hunt and O’Brien JJ.A.; Osborne v. Rowlett (1880), 13 Ch. D. 774, at p. 785). A question of law cannot, therefore, be confused with the various factual matrices from which that question of law might arise.

[128]                     In our respectful view, our colleague’s reasons are flawed because the core issue on appeal (the statutory interpretation of “the sexual activity in question” in s. 273.1(1)) is a straightforward question of law that this Court categorically resolved in Hutchinson. Our colleague relies on the argument that this case is factually distinguishable. But this is irrelevant, as the underlying question of law is identical across both appeals.

[129]                     Further, when the question of law is one of statutory interpretation, the ratio decidendi of prior jurisprudence of this Court must be understood in the context of the Court’s role: to provide a clear and uniformly applicable interpretation of how a statutory provision is to be understood and applied by lower courts across Canada. When this Court is presented with a statutory interpretation question for the first time, its role is to “give effect to the intention of the legislature insofar as that intention is discoverable from the language of the text” and further assisted by the rules of statutory interpretation (R. Sullivan, Statutory Interpretation (3rd ed. 2016), at p. 38).

[130]                     The exercise of statutory interpretation, by necessity, cannot invite multiple competing interpretations or “gradients” of application based on the facts of a particular case. As a matter of stare decisis, a court is bound by a prior interpretation of a statutory provision, whether of the same court or of a higher court, until that statement is reversed by a court of higher authority, or until the statutory provision is amended by the legislature (Delta Acceptance Corporation Ltd. v. Redman (1966), 1966 CanLII 130 (ON CA), 55 D.L.R. (2d) 481 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 485, per Schroeder J.A.).

[131]                     Our colleague sidesteps Hutchinson by suggesting that the understanding of its ratio has shifted over time in accordance with “the basic fundamental principle that the common law develops by experience” (para. 97, quoting Henry, at para. 57). We do not dispute that principle; but it is of no moment here. Hutchinson is not a common law precedent. It is a statutory interpretation precedent. The meaning of the interpreted statutory provision in Hutchinson — s. 273.1(1) of the Criminal Code — does not shift over time (see paras. 261‑62, below). Nor does its meaning shift because some have criticized what it plainly stands for: that condom use does not go to the sexual activity in question (Martin J.’s reasons, at para. 96). In interpreting a statutory provision, the judicial role is to give effect to the intent of the legislature. It is a fundamental error to apply the “living tree” methodology to the interpretation of statutes. And it is no less an error to confuse statutory interpretation with development of the common law, which is judge-made and applies in the absence of legislative enactment.

[132]                     An additional systemic point is worth mentioning here. Our colleague’s approach would tend to undermine the precedential force of all our decisions. Future litigants could attempt to confine all our precedents to their peculiar facts. Similarly, lower courts could routinely sidestep our precedents by distinguishing the case before them with ease. Our court would cease to be an apex court institutionally tasked with definitively resolving legal issues of public importance, and instead become a court of error correction whose decisions are confined to the facts of each case. As the authorities reviewed above make clear, the role of this Court at the apex of our modern judicial hierarchy is not comparable to that of the House of Lords at the close of the reign of Queen Victoria.

(2)         Properly Interpreted, Hutchinson Governs This Appeal

[133]                     In light of the foregoing, to ascertain the binding ratio of Hutchinson, it is necessary to review what the majority actually said, what the minority understood the majority to be saying, and how courts have interpreted and applied the holding in Hutchinson.

(a)         The Hutchinson Majority Held That Condom Use Is Not a Sex Act Under Section 273.1(1)

[134]                     The plain words used throughout the majority decision in Hutchinson confirm its ratio; that condom use does not form part of “the sexual activity in question” under s. 273.1(1) of the Criminal Code.

[135]                     At paras. 2‑3 and 5, the majority stated its intention to provide broad and binding guidance on the proper interpretation of consent under s. 273.1(1) as it relates to condom use. These passages are particularly illuminating, so we reproduce them here in their entirety:

In this case, the complainant consented to sexual activity with a condom to prevent conception. Unknown to her at the time, her partner, Mr. Hutchinson, poked holes in the condom and the complainant became pregnant. Mr. Hutchinson was charged with aggravated sexual assault. The complainant said that she did not consent to unprotected sex. The trial judge agreed and convicted Mr. Hutchinson of sexual assault. The majority of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal . . . upheld the conviction on the basis that condom protection was an essential feature of the sexual activity, and therefore the complainant did not consent to the “sexual activity in question”. Farrar J.A., dissenting, held that there was consent to the sexual activity, but that a new trial was required to determine whether consent was vitiated by fraud.

 

The immediate problem is how cases such as this fall to be resolved under the provisions of the Criminal Code. This is an issue of statutory interpretation. Underlying this is a broader question — where should the line between criminality and non-criminality be drawn when consent is the result of deception?

 

. . .

 

We conclude that the first step [of the process for analyzing consent to sexual activity] requires proof that the complainant did not voluntarily agree to the touching, its sexual nature, or the identity of the partner. Mistakes on the complainant’s part (however caused) in relation to other matters, such as whether the partner is using effective birth control or has a sexually transmitted disease, are not relevant at this stage. [Emphasis added; citations omitted.]

[136]                     These passages — for which our colleague does not adequately account — are a complete answer to para. 90 of her reasons, which embrace Groberman J.A.’s unduly narrow reading of Hutchinson in the judgment below.

[137]                     Our colleague, like Groberman J.A., contends that Hutchinson endorses an interpretation of “the sexual activity in question” that treats birth control measures as “‘conditions or qualities of the physical act’ where they do not inherently change the physical act itself” and, “where they do change the physical act itself, like condom use, they may fall under s. 273.1” (para. 90). Our colleague suggests the majority drew a distinction “premised on the efficacy of the condom” (para. 90). But, again, this is simply not so. The Hutchinson majority explicitly held that “there is no reason in principle to analyze a case of a lie that obtains consent to unprotected sex and a lie as to the condition of a condom differently” (para. 41 (emphasis added)). Our colleague’s attempt to parse this sentence in a manner that supports her position is neither cogent nor tenable (para. 93).

[138]                     Our colleague also expresses the view that “nowhere in [Hutchinson] does the Court address the total absence of a condom in circumstances where consent was conditional on its use” (para. 94). Again, this is clearly not so. To the contrary, the Hutchinson majority stated that the law must treat “a lie that obtains consent to unprotected sex and a lie as to the condition of a condom” consistently, and later that “[e]ffective condom use . . . is not a sex act” (paras. 41 and 64). Sabotage is obviously one means by which a sexual partner’s stipulation of condom use can be circumvented. But the Hutchinson Court did not confine itself to this particular means. Another way of rendering a condom ineffective is to remove it or fail to wear it, despite an agreement that it be worn, leading to unprotected sex. This is exactly what is alleged to have occurred in the case at bar: Mr. Kirkpatrick, by deceptively concealing from the complainant that he was not wearing a condom, obtained her consent to unprotected sex despite her express wish that he wear protection. It is obvious that the Hutchinson majority was alive to this scenario and intended it to be treated consistently with condom sabotage, i.e., under s. 265(3)(c).

[139]                     In rejecting the “essential features” approach, the Hutchinson majority decided on a narrow reading of s. 273.1(1). In so doing, it made a categorical statement that precludes any distinction between effective condom use and the absence of a condom. It thus confined “the sexual activity in question” to the physical act itself (for example, kissing, petting, oral sex, intercourse, or the use of sex toys) (para. 54). Again, this is a complete answer to our colleague’s claim, at para. 25, that “[t]wo alternative pathways are available to decide the legal effect of Mr. Kirkpatrick’s failure to wear a condom”. It is this simple: Hutchinson firmly blocks the pathway our colleague now proposes to take.

(b)         The Hutchinson Minority Understood the Majority’s Holding That Condom Use Is Not a Sex Act Under Section 273.1(1)

[140]                     Our colleague declines to address the minority reasons in Hutchinson because “what the minority says is not the law and what the minority said about the majority judgment is also not the law” (para. 95). We see three issues with this proposition. First, our colleague essentially adopts the Hutchinson minority’s reasoning to rewrite this Court’s jurisprudence on the issue at hand. Second, she herself looks to the “minority’s approach” (premised on condom efficacy) to explain the “reasoning behind” the majority’s interpretation of s. 273.1(1) (para. 90). Finally, and with respect, our colleague misses the point of our reference to the minority reasons in this context. Of course, the minority reasons do not state the law. Indeed, and as we will show, it is our colleague who treats the minority reasons in Hutchinson as governing here. But minority reasons may be helpful in clarifying the ratio of a case, as stated by the majority (see TCF Ventures Corp. v. Cambie Malone’s Corp., 2017 BCCA 129, 95 B.C.L.R. (5th) 346, at para. 25). And, here, our understanding of the ratio of Hutchinson — and not that of our colleague — is confirmed by the minority opinion in that case. Simply put, how the minority understood the import of the majority reasons in Hutchinson assists in identifying the ratio of that case.

[141]                     Animating the majority’s reasons in Hutchinson was the desire to maintain a bright line rule to avoid over‑criminalization. This led the majority to conclude that condom use was not part of “the sexual activity in question”. It contrasted this approach with the minority’s “variation” on the “essential features” approach, which in the majority’s view “would also result in the criminalization of acts that should not attract the heavy hand of the criminal law” (paras. 44‑46). This point of disagreement between the Hutchinson majority and minority reinforces our view that the issue presented in the present appeal has already been decided by this Court. The Hutchinson majority’s very point in drawing a bright line between sex with a condom and “the sexual activity in question” was to consign all “conditions or qualities of the physical act, such as birth control measures” to the fraud analysis (para. 55).

[142]                     Crucially, the minority confirmed the effect of the majority’s reasoning, at paras. 97‑98:

The heart of our disagreement with [the majority] turns on whether the use of a condom is included in the manner in which the sexual activity is carried out. According to our colleagues, the use of a condom during sexual intercourse does not change the “specific physical sex act” which occurs, but rather is merely a “collateral conditio[n]” to the sexual activity. In their view, so long as there is consent to “sexual intercourse”, this general consent is not vitiated by a deception about condom use unless it exposes the individual to a deprivation within the meaning of s. 265(3)(c), which they conclude in this case means depriving a woman of the choice to become pregnant by “making her pregnant, or exposing her to an increased risk of becoming pregnant”.

 

With respect, it does not follow that because a condom is a form of birth control, it is not also part of the sexual activity. Removing the use of a condom from the ambit of what is consented to in the sexual activity because in some cases it may be used for contraceptive purposes, means that an individual is precluded from requiring a condom during intercourse where pregnancy is not at issue. . . . If one of those individuals has insisted upon the use of a condom, and their partner has deliberately and knowingly ignored those wishes — whether by not using a condom at all, removing it partway through the sexual activity, or sabotaging it — that individual will nonetheless be presumed to have consented under the approach suggested by our colleagues. . . . We fail to see how condoms can be seen as anything but an aspect of how sexual touching occurs. When individuals agree to sexual activity with a condom, they are not merely agreeing to a sexual activity, they are agreeing to how it should take place. That is what s. 273.1(1) was intended to protect. [Underlining added.]

[143]                     With respect, our colleague misses the mark in saying that Hutchinson does not stand for the proposition that “all cases involving a condom fall outside s. 273.1 and can only be addressed, if at all, when the conditions of fraud are established” (para. 83). She also incorrectly contends that Hutchinson “does not apply to when the accused refuses to wear a condom and the complainant’s consent has been conditioned on its use” (para. 83). The foregoing passages make plain that this Court squarely considered and categorically resolved this matter. Our interpretation is not an “unnecessarily expansive” one (para. 90). It is anchored in the words of both the majority and minority reasons in Hutchinson.

[144]                     We would add only this. The upshot of our colleague’s interpretation of Hutchinson is that the minority did not understand the true effect of the majority’s decision. It should go without saying that we ardently reject any suggestion that three members of this Court, after deliberating for four months, could have misconstrued their colleagues’ position in such a fundamental way. This notion is belied by the opening paragraph of the Hutchinson minority opinion, at para. 76, which captures the minority’s understanding of the core question before the Court: Is sexual intercourse with a condom a different sexual activity than sexual intercourse “without a condom”? (para. 76 (emphasis in original)). The majority answered this question in the negative, despite the minority’s vigorous disagreement. This is, of course, the very basis upon which our colleague now says Hutchinson is “distinguishable”.

(c)         Subsequent Jurisprudence Confirms Hutchinson’s Ratio Is That Condom Use Is Not a Sex Act Under Section 273.1(1)

[145]                     As the Honourable R. J. Sharpe (writing extra‑judicially) has observed, “the answer to the question ‘What does a case decide?’ is usually ‘Only time will tell’” (Good Judgment: Making Judicial Decisions (2018), at p. 152). Indeed, it is only “through the crucible of the common law fact-specific method that we determine the precedential value of a prior decision” (p. 152).

[146]                     And, in this case, time has told. The judicial treatment of Hutchinson (our colleague’s reasons excepted) removes any doubt that may somehow have lingered about what the decision stands for. Our colleague says that “the basic principles of statutory interpretation and consent law support the common-sense proposition that sexual intercourse with a condom is a different sexual activity from sexual intercourse without a condom” (para. 75). As a matter of law, this is simply not so. Our colleague cites no authority in support of this “common‑sense” proposition. And she overlooks a vast swath of persuasive jurisprudence undermining it.

[147]                     Many appellate court decisions affirm the two-step approach set out in Hutchinson as good law and reiterate that “the sexual activity in question” is limited to the specific physical sex act, its sexual nature, and the identity of the sexual partner. Other conditions, such as condom use or sexually transmitted diseases are not included in this definition (see, e.g., R. v. A.E., 2021 ABCA 172, 466 D.L.R. (4th) 226, at paras. 24 and 65‑66; R. v. Brar, 2021 ABCA 146, 23 Alta. L.R. (7th) 1, at paras. 27‑29; R. v. P.D.C., 2021 ONCA 134, 401 C.C.C. (3d) 406, at para. 73; R. v. Nauya, 2021 NUCA 1, at para. 12 (CanLII); R. v. G. (N.), 2020 ONCA 494, 152 O.R. (3d) 24, at paras. 53‑54; R. v. Capewell, 2020 BCCA 82, 386 C.C.C. (3d) 192, at paras. 51 and 64; R. v. Kwon, 2020 SKCA 56, 386 C.C.C. (3d) 553, at paras. 27‑28; R. v. Percy, 2020 NSCA 11, 61 C.R. (7th) 7, at paras. 110‑11; Charest v. R., 2019 QCCA 1401, at para. 99 (CanLII); R. v. Al-Rawi, 2018 NSCA 10, 359 C.C.C. (3d) 237, at para. 68; P. (P.) v. D. (D.), 2017 ONCA 180, 409 D.L.R. (4th) 691, at para. 76).

[148]                     Several of these appellate decisions have adopted and used the phrase “physical sex act” to describe a type of sex act, not condom usage, offering further support for our interpretation of the ratio of Hutchinson. For example, in P. (P.) v. D. (D.), the claimant mistakenly believed his partner had been taking birth control pills only to discover she had conceived his child. Rouleau J.A. of the Court of Appeal for Ontario described the Hutchinson ratio as follows: “The majority in Hutchinson considered that the presence or absence of a condom during sexual intercourse does not affect the ‘specific physical sex act’ to which the complainant consented, namely, sexual intercourse, but is rather a ‘collateral condition’ to that sexual activity” (para. 81, citing Hutchinson, at para. 67).

[149]                     Likewise, in A.E., a case involving a brutal sexual assault alleged by the complainant, Martin J.A. of the Court of Appeal for Alberta held that the ratio in Hutchinson was that the “‘sexual activity in question’ is to be interpreted narrowly — to refer to the basic physical act in question — and does not include conditions or qualities of the act, such as birth control measures or the presence of STDs” (para. 65). On appeal, this Court endorsed this narrow approach in oral reasons.

[150]                     And finally, in G. (N.), the appellant wore a condom but did not disclose his HIV status to his sexual partners. Fairburn J.A. of the Court of Appeal for Ontario (as she then was) explained, at para. 53, “the sexual activity in question” in the following terms:

. . . as set out in Hutchinson, at paras. 55, 57, and recently reinforced in Barton, at para. 88, consent is linked to the “sexual activity in question”, which encompasses “the specific physical sex act”, “the sexual nature of the activity”, and the “identity of the partner”. It does not, though, include the “conditions or qualities of the physical act, such as . . . the presence of sexually transmitted diseases”. [Citations omitted.]

 

(Citing to Bennett J.A.’s holding in the court below (2020 BCCA 136, 63 C.R. (7th) 338, at para. 89).)

[151]                     Indeed, this Court’s own post-Hutchinson sex assault jurisprudence accords with the plain wording of the decision, as understood by the Hutchinson minority and appellate courts nationwide.

[152]                     In R. v. Barton, 2019 SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579, Moldaver J. held that consent “must be linked to the ‘sexual activity in question’”, which “does not include ‘conditions or qualities of the physical act, such as birth control measures’” (para. 88, citing Hutchinson, at paras. 55 and 57).

[153]                     In R. v. Goldfinch, 2019 SCC 38, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 3, Karakatsanis J. cited para. 27 of Hutchinson for the proposition that affirmative communicated consent must be given “for each and every sexual act” (para. 44). This citation is notable. Paragraph 27 of Hutchinson explains the legislative history regarding amendments to the definition of “consent” in s. 273.1(1) of the Criminal Code, and concludes with the following remark: “There was no suggestion that Parliament intended to expand the notion of ‘sexual activity’ by including not only the sexual act for which consent is required, but also potentially infinite collateral conditions, such as the state of the condom” (emphasis added).

[154]                     We pause here to briefly draw attention to our colleague’s reference, at para. 96, to criticism of the majority’s reasoning in Hutchinson from various interveners to this appeal. Our colleague says that, if Hutchinson is interpreted as we say it must be — i.e., as excluding condom use from the consent analysis in s. 273.1(1) — that interpretation would “radically constrain the scope and centrality of consent under s. 273.1, and in a manner wholly inconsistent with this Court’s jurisprudence on consent both before and after it”. She proposes an interpretation of Hutchinson’s scope that immunizes it from the criticisms levied by various interveners in this appeal and certain academic commentators. Respectfully, this reasoning is misguided. We say this for two reasons.

[155]                     First, the criticism of Hutchinson cited by the Crown and some interveners supports our reading of the decision, not our colleague’s. Indeed, the relevant submissions and articles reveal virtual consensus that Hutchinson categorically excluded condom use from the definition of “the sexual activity in question” under s. 273.1(1). To highlight but one example, Professors L. Gotell and I. Grant, cited by the Crown (and by our colleague, at para. 71), summarize the Hutchinson majority decision as follows:

The central issue in Hutchinson was how to define voluntary agreement to “the sexual activity in question” under section 273.1(1) of the Criminal Code. Was “the sexual activity in question” in Hutchinson simply vaginal intercourse, or was it vaginal intercourse with a condom? The majority . . . determined that the sexual activity in question does not include whether a condom was used, holding that the complainant had subjectively consented, but that her consent had been vitiated by fraud. The concurring minority, per Justices Abella and Moldaver, concluded that the complainant had not consented to unprotected sex and there was no need to consider fraud vitiating consent. [Emphasis added; emphasis in original deleted.]

 

(“Non‑Consensual Condom Removal in Canadian Law Before and After R. v. Hutchinson” (2021), 44 Dal. L.J. 439, at p. 454)

Put simply, the commentary cited in the submissions before this Court show just how divergent and novel our colleague’s reading of Hutchinson is. None of the relevant interveners or commentators suggest that Hutchinson can be confined to condom “sabotage”. In fact, its jurisprudential breadth is precisely why they criticize it.

[156]                     Second, and more significantly from the standpoint of legal error, our colleague misconceives the exercise of identifying the ratio of a case and the broader doctrine of stare decisis. She appears to suggest that we ought to interpret a decision’s ratio more narrowly because it would otherwise be subject to criticism and would therefore need to be overturned. Later in these reasons, we discuss in detail why the fact that others disagree with a particular precedent is not grounds for overturning it. For now, it suffices to say that this is decidedly not how the doctrine of stare decisis operates. More to the point, our colleague cites no authority for the proposition that this Court may effectively read down the ratio of one of its prior decisions in response to extrinsic opprobrium. This is unsurprising; the very suggestion is astonishing. This Court has the solemn duty to resolve some of the most controversial and difficult legal questions in the country. In adjudicating these matters, it is inevitable that some people will feel that the Court has made the “wrong” decision. But the mere fact of criticism does not provide a proper basis on which to retrospectively re‑cast a statutory provision that has been carefully and authoritatively interpreted by a panel of this Court.

(d)         Conclusion

[157]                     In sum, the ratio of Hutchinson is broader than its facts. Hutchinson conclusively determined the meaning of “the sexual activity in question” under s. 273.1(1) as excluding all forms of condom use, not only condom sabotage.

[158]                     Like the accused in Hutchinson, Mr. Kirkpatrick is alleged to have known the complainant “would not have consented to sex without a condom” (para. 44). Rather than sabotaging the condom, Mr. Kirkpatrick is further alleged to have deceptively failed to disclose he was not wearing one before penetrating the complainant. Had our colleague properly interpreted Hutchinson, she would have found that she was required to analyze this scenario under s. 265(3)(c). This approach is mandated by Hutchinson because it provides a “principled and clear line between criminal and non-criminal conduct” (para. 49). Our colleague’s approach muddies that line by re-introducing the “how the physical act is carried out” approach explicitly rejected in Hutchinson.

[159]                     But our colleague does not merely misinterpret Hutchinson. She also attempts to distinguish it on grounds that, in our respectful view, are both illogical and incoherent. We will next explain why doing so risks undermining the “twin watchwords” of clarity and restraint motivating the Hutchinson majority (para. 42).

(3)         Our Colleague Attempts to Distinguish Hutchinson on Grounds That Are Incoherent and Illogical

[160]                     It is incoherent to distinguish Hutchinson on the basis of “no condom” versus “sabotaged condoms”, as our colleague attempts to do at paras. 82‑98. She suggests that a sabotaged condom differs from non-use of a condom, because sabotage concerns the efficacy of a condom as a method of contraception whereas condom non‑use goes to an element of the physical sex act (paras. 88 and 92‑93). She thus concludes, at paras. 25 and 101, respectively, that, where condom use is a condition of consent, it either “must” or “may” form part of the “sexual activity in question”. She says that her interpretation “brings clarity and consistency to the law” (para. 101). We disagree. To the contrary, our colleague obscures the bright line of criminality established in Hutchinson.

[161]                     Further, the “distinction” is illogical. Whether a condom is not worn or an ineffective condom is worn, the gravamen of the problem is the same: the participant’s stipulation (that the accused wear a condom) has not been respected by the accused. Our colleague is, in substance, saying that Hutchinson governs only one way of failing to respect that stipulation, whereas her reasons deal with another. And so, one particular way will be treated as a condition precedent to obtaining consent, whereas another will be treated as a vitiation of consent previously obtained. This introduces an undesirable and unnecessary irrationality to the law governing consent to sexual activity.

[162]                     We acknowledge that our colleague frequently uses the word “effective” as a qualifier in attempts to distinguish between the present case, where a condom was not worn at all, and Hutchinson, where a sabotaged and thus an “ineffective” condom was worn. But this is a distinction without a difference. Our colleague says that Hutchinson “did not establish mandatory rules for all future cases involving a condom” (para. 76). Rather, she characterizes it as a “classic case of deception” and says that Hutchinson “simply held that cases involving condom sabotage and deceit should be analyzed under the fraud provision rather than as part of the sexual activity in question” (para. 82). We see two issues with this statement. First, we see nothing in the facts of Hutchinson that could remotely be described as “classic”. If there is a body of case law suggesting that the deception of sexual partners by using a pin to poke holes in condoms is a routine occurrence, we are unaware of it. More to the point, our colleague oversimplifies what this Court said in Hutchinson. As noted above, one obvious way to render a condom ineffective is to surreptitiously remove it or fail to wear it despite the complainant’s express wish that it be worn.

[163]                     By arguing that the majority in Hutchinson referred only to effective condom use, our colleague introduces needless uncertainty into the criminal law. Our colleague’s new standard is that birth control measures may be conditions of the physical sex act “where they do not inherently change the physical act itself” but “where they do change the physical act itself, like condom use, they may fall under s. 273.1” (para. 90). On this approach, pinpricks in a condom fall under the Hutchinson regime, but the absence of a condom does not. What should courts do about a condom that had its tip cut off? Should it matter how much of the tip was cut off? What about a condom that rips mid-intercourse? What if the condom falls off completely during intercourse? This type of inquiry introduces both absurdity and uncertainty in the law where there was neither. This highly undesirable result is precisely what the majority sought to avoid in Hutchinson. The passage from the majority reasons on this point, at para. 41, bears repeating:

. . . adopting the “essential features”/“how the act was carried out” approaches would make the law inconsistent, highly formalistic and unduly uncertain. The law would be inconsistent because there is no reason in principle to analyze a case of a lie that obtains consent to unprotected sex and a lie as to the condition of a condom differently.

Thus, in the Hutchinson majority’s words, an ineffective condom is equivalent to no condom at all.

[164]                     Our colleague defends her flawed reading of Hutchinson, in part, on the basis that it “best respects Parliament’s equality-seeking and dignity‑promoting purposes” by protecting “vulnerable women, including women living in poverty” and “racialized women” from non-consensual condom removal (paras. 56 and 61). Yet, in the same breath, she contends that dealing with condom use under s. 273.1(1) “is not an expansion” of the provision (para. 104). In effect, our colleague is retroactively re‑interpreting (or updating) Parliament’s intent in a manner inconsistent with that intent as it was discerned by the Hutchinson majority, at paras. 27‑28. We say again: statutes are not “living trees”. Statutory interpretation entails searching for original intent — a point‑in‑time inquiry that does not evolve or change based on a reviewing court’s imputation to Parliament of an intent that better conforms to the court’s own policy preferences. Parliament could have amended s. 273.1(1) of the Criminal Code after Hutchinson was released, had it wished to pursue the “equality‑seeking” and “dignity‑promoting” purposes our colleague finds wanting in Parliament’s first effort, and now retroactively imputes.

[165]                     Moreover, in our respectful view, and (once again) contrary to the letter and spirit of Hutchinson, our colleague fails to consider how her interpretation of consent not only expands the scope of criminal liability, but does so in a way that is likely to undermine, rather than promote, equality. In Hutchinson, the majority explained that the imperative of restraint in applying the “blunt instrument of the criminal law” may “sometimes work at cross‑purposes to absolute protection of sexual autonomy” (paras. 18‑19). Avoiding over-criminalization through restraint recognizes the criminal law’s profound impact on the lives and liberties of those it ensnares. This Court has repeatedly recognized that our criminal justice system disproportionately ensnares poor and racialized communities (R. v. Le, 2019 SCC 34, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 692, at paras. 90‑97; R. v. Ahmad, 2020 SCC 11, at para. 25; R. v. C.P., 2021 SCC 19, at paras. 88‑89). Many scholars also contend that North American criminal laws targeting sexual violence “have contributed to the disproportionate criminalization of racialized men, the diminishment of female legal and sexual agency, and the scapegoating of a widespread social problem onto a handful of sexual deviants” (D. Phillips, “Let’s Talk About Sexual Assault: Survivor Stories and the Law in the Jian Ghomeshi Media Discourse” (2017), 54 Osgoode Hall L.J. 1133, at p. 1148; see also D. L. Martin, “Retribution Revisited: A Reconsideration of Feminist Criminal Law Reform Strategies” (1998), 36 Osgoode Hall L.J. 151; A. Gruber, “Rape, Feminism, and the War on Crime” (2009), 84 Wash. L.

O’Doherty, “Racialized, Gendered, and Sensationalized: An examination of Canadian anti-trafficking laws, their enforcement, and their (re)presentation” (2020), 35 C.J.L.S. 23).

[166]                     The Hutchinson majority was clearly alive to concerns about over‑extending the criminal law. It explicitly declared its aversion to criminalizing conduct that would lack “the necessary reprehensible character” and to “casting the net of the criminal law too broadly” (para. 53). Contrary to our colleague’s assertion, at paras. 103-104, her proposed approach would undermine this key pillar of Hutchinson by expanding the scope of criminal liability for sexual assault and offending the principle of restraint. It would treat a complainant’s mistake regarding condom usage (e.g., believing a condom was being used when it was not) as a consent violation under s. 273.1(1), even in the absence of deception by the accused or a risk of harm to the complainant. As Dickson C.J., dissenting, but not on this point, held in R. v. Bernard, 1988 CanLII 22 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 833, it is not for the courts to “broaden the net of [criminal] liability, particularly as changes in the law through judicial decision operate retrospectively” (pp. 860‑61). In our respectful view, it is reasonable to surmise that the burden of the expansion of criminal liability proposed by our colleague will disproportionately fall on the same vulnerable communities she purports to protect.

[167]                     Finally, our colleague discusses the problem of “stealthing” (i.e., where the accused pretends to have put on a condom or secretly removes it) at length in her reasons (paras. 57‑64). She appears to suggest that this is a brand new issue the Hutchinson Court did not consider. We disagree. Our colleague mistakes form for substance. As we have already explained (and as the Hutchinson majority stated, at para. 41) a sabotaged condom is equivalent to no condom or a condom that is surreptitiously removed. In both scenarios, consent to “unprotected sex” is obtained through deceit, such that the proper analysis flows through s. 265(3)(c), not s. 273.1(1).

(4)         Our Colleague’s Misreading of Hutchinson Effects an Overturning of Precedent

[168]                     Although our colleague uses the term “distinguish”, in effect, she overturns Hutchinson.

[169]                     Indeed, our colleague’s description of Hutchinson’s jurisprudential role leaves Hutchinson with virtually no precedential value. Hutchinson, we are assured, will continue to govern cases “of deception, for example where a condom is used, but rendered ineffective through an act of sabotage and deception” and where a complainant “finds out after the sexual act” that the condom was sabotaged, but not during (para. 103 (emphasis removed)). In other words, on her interpretation, Hutchinson would apply only where an accused poked holes in a condom, or perhaps (but we do not know) damaged the condom in some other unidentified way. We do not accept that a 4‑3 split panel of this Court intended its decision to be confined to a single bizarre set of factual circumstances. As we have indicated, this unduly narrow reading is manifestly inconsistent with this Court’s long-standing jurisprudence on the proper flexible and broad approach to interpreting the ratio of its decisions.

[170]                     This brings us to the following section of our reasons, wherein we (1) reaffirm the importance of stare decisis, particularly at the apex court level; and (2) outline a clear framework for deciding whether to overturn a precedent of this Court, rooted in the relevant jurisprudence and buttressed by the foundational principles of stare decisis as central tenets of our justice system.

B.            Stare Decisis

[171]                     As set out above, Hutchinson is not properly distinguishable; rather it is binding precedent in this case. In claiming that Hutchinson is distinguishable, our colleague declines to do the difficult work of determining whether Hutchinson should be overturned. The Crown argued (in the alternative) that it should be. As we hold that Hutchinson is not distinguishable, it necessarily follows that we must consider whether it should be overturned.

[172]                     In deciding whether Hutchinson should be overturned it is necessary to consider the framework for making such decisions. Ironically, the jurisprudence of this Court regarding overturning its own precedents — horizontal stare decisis — lacks clarity and coherence. In this section, we examine that doctrine. We underscore that stare decisis is fundamental to legal stability, judicial legitimacy, and the rule of law. Failing to have proper regard to stare decisis has serious, far-reaching consequences.

[173]                     First, we define stare decisis and briefly set out its history. Second, we describe its rationale. Third, we consider two criticisms of stare decisis and explain how these critiques arise not from its proper application, but rather from the failure to do so. Fourth, we set out circumstances in which this Court should overturn its own precedents, as well as factors that should not be the basis for doing so. Fifth, we deal with differences in applying stare decisis in cases involving statutory interpretation (like this one), the common law, and constitutional decisions.

(1)         The Doctrine of Stare Decisis

(a)         Introduction and History

[174]                     Stare decisis is derived from the Latin phrase, stare decisis et non quieta movere — “to stand by previous decisions and not to disturb settled matters” (Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019), at p. 2016). According to this foundational doctrine, judges are to apply authoritative precedents and have like matters “be decided by like” (T. Healy, “Stare Decisis As A Constitutional Requirement” (2001), 104 W. Va. L. Rev. 43, at p. 56, citing the 13th century English jurist Henry de Bracton).

[175]                     English and Canadian courts came to treat stare decisis as rigid, with no ability to revisit precedent (see Beamish v. Beamish (1861), 9 H.L.C. 274; Stuart v. Bank of Montreal (1909), 1909 CanLII 3 (SCC), 41 S.C.R. 516). These courts adhered to the then dominant Blackstonian view of the law which posited that judges could only discover the law, not change it (R. v. Salituro, 1991 CanLII 17 (SCC), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 654, at pp. 665‑66; Canada (Attorney General) v. Hislop, 2007 SCC 10, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 429, at para. 84). To escape this historical straitjacket, courts interpreted the ratios of decisions narrowly, distinguishing precedents for which they claimed no authority to overturn (Henry, at para. 53).

[176]                     The mid-20th century brought change, as courts affirmed authority to depart from precedent. In a 1966 practice statement, the House of Lords indicated they could depart from previous decisions where “too rigid adherence to precedent may lead to injustice in a particular case and also unduly restrict the proper development of the law” (Practice Statement (Judicial Precedent), [1966] 1 W.L.R. 1234). This Court had adopted a somewhat similar approach in Reference re The Farm Products Marketing Act, 1957 CanLII 1 (SCC), [1957] S.C.R. 198.

[177]                     This Court, like apex courts in other common law jurisdictions, has sought within the doctrine of stare decisis to balance principled development of the law and the rationale for maintaining precedent (see, e.g., Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development v. Ranville, 1982 CanLII 202 (SCC), [1982] 2 S.C.R. 518, at pp. 528‑29; Canada v. Craig, 2012 SCC 43, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 489, at para. 24; Ontario (Attorney General) v. Fraser, 2011 SCC 20, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 58; Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992); Willers v. Joyce (No. 2), [2016] UKSC 44, [2018] A.C. 843, at paras. 4 et seq.). As the High Court of Australia stated:

No Justice is entitled to ignore the decisions and reasoning of [their] predecessors, and to arrive at [their] own judgment as though the pages of the law reports were blank, or as though the authority of a decision did not survive beyond the rising of the Court. A Justice, unlike a legislator, cannot introduce a programme of reform which sets at nought decisions formerly made and principles formerly established.

 

(Queensland v. Commonwealth, [1977] 139 C.L.R. 585, at p. 599)

(b)         Types of Stare Decisis: Vertical and Horizontal

[178]                     There are two forms of stare decisis: vertical and horizontal. Vertical stare decisis requires lower courts to follow decisions of higher courts, with limited exceptions (Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, 2013 SCC 72, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1101, at paras. 42 and 44; Carter v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 5, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 331, at para. 44; R. v. Comeau, 2018 SCC 15, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 342, at paras. 26 and 41). Horizontal stare decisis binds courts of coordinate jurisdiction in a similar, but not identical, manner (Rowe and Katz, at p. 17).

[179]                     Horizontal stare decisis operates differently at each level of court. There is more room to depart from precedent as one moves up the judicial hierarchy. The test for overturning precedent at the trial level is more limited than that for overturning precedent by intermediate appellate courts (for horizontal stare decisis at the trial level, see Re Hansard Spruce Mills Ltd., 1954 CanLII 253 (BC SC), [1954] 4 D.L.R. 590 (B.C.S.C.); R. v. Sullivan, 2022 SCC 19; for horizontal stare decisis at the intermediate appellate level, see R. v. Neves, 2005 MBCA 112, 201 Man. R. (2d) 44, at paras. 100‑108; David Polowin Real Estate Ltd. v. Dominion of Canada General Insurance Co. (2005), 2005 CanLII 21093 (ON CA), 76 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.), at paras. 126‑43; Tan v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 186, [2019] 2 F.C.R. 648, at paras. 24‑36; Toronto Standard Condominium Corporation No. 1628 v. Toronto Standard Condominium Corporation, 2020 ONCA 612, 454 D.L.R. (4th) 126, at para. 73).

[180]                     The tests for horizontal stare decisis at the trial and at the intermediate appellate level differ, reflecting the institutional roles of those courts. We will not deal with stare decisis in these contexts. We would note only that the tests differ because most trial decisions are appealable as of right to a Court of Appeal, whose responsibility is to correct legal errors made at first instance. Conversely, intermediate appellate courts are often the court of last resort. Courts of Appeal therefore need more room to depart from their past precedents than trial courts.

(c)         Supreme Court of Canada Precedents Are Governed by a Particular Type of Horizontal Stare Decisis

[181]                     Our Court’s decisions are different from decisions by intermediate appellate or trial courts. As we have already indicated, our decisions as the apex court often require “the elaboration of general principles that can unify large areas of the law and provide meaningful guidance to the legal community and the general public” (Daly, at p. 5). Such guidance is given effect in a variety of circumstances and for an indefinite period. Eventually, these frameworks may need to be revisited to ensure that they remain workable and responsive to social realities. The framework for horizontal stare decisis at this Court must take account of its institutional role and how that role relates to the rationale for stare decisis.

(2)         The Rationale for Stare Decisis

[182]                     It is worthwhile to reflect on the rationale for stare decisis. Why is it that stare decisis disentitles judges from arriving at their decisions afresh? What value does the doctrine bring to Canada’s judicial system? Why does disregard for the doctrine have far‑reaching consequences? How does such disregard validate criticisms levied at this Court? (See, e.g., D. Parkes, “Precedent Revisited: Carter v Canada (AG) and the Contemporary Practice of Precedent” (2016), 10:1 McGill J.L. & Health S123.)

[183]                     Stare decisis promotes: (1) legal certainty and stability, allowing people to plan and manage their affairs (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, at paras. 20, 270 and 281; Sharpe, at p. 147); (2) the rule of law, such that people are subject to similar rules (Vavilov, at paras. 260 and 281); and (3) the legitimate and efficient exercise of judicial authority (Watkins v. Olafson, 1989 CanLII 36 (SCC), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 750, at pp. 760‑61). We explain each of these rationales below.

(a)         Legal Certainty and Stability

[184]                     Stare decisis promotes legal certainty and stability. The doctrine “provides some moorings so that [people] may trade and arrange their affairs with confidence. Stare decisis serves to take the capricious element out of law and to give stability to a society” (W. O. Douglas, “Stare Decisis” (1949), 49 Colum. L. Rev. 735, at p. 736). Failure to adhere to the doctrine creates unpredictability in the law (Sharpe, at p. 146). The construct of planning one’s affairs stretches beyond business and estate reliance; stare decisis also protects societal reliance on the law (see, e.g., the discussion of societal reliance on Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), in Casey, at p. 856).

(b)         The Rule of Law

[185]                     The rule of law has interlocking components (T. Bingham, The Rule of Law (2010), at pp. 160‑70; Sharpe, at pp. 122‑24). Stare decisis relates to the component that demands like cases be treated alike. “[T]here will be no equal justice under law if a negligence rule is applied in the morning but not in the afternoon” (Douglas, at p. 736; see also Sriskandarajah v. United States of America, 2012 SCC 70, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 609, at para. 18; Sharpe, at p. 146).

[186]                     Failure to properly apply stare decisis creates different law in similar cases, as recently demonstrated in R. v. Chan, 2018 ONSC 3849, 365 C.C.C. (3d) 376. Judges’ inconsistent adherence to precedential declarations of invalidity of s. 33.1 of the Criminal Code gave certain accused access to the defence of automatism, but precluded the same access to others (Chan, at paras. 51‑52). This confounds the rule of law. The availability of a defence cannot depend on the personal preferences of the presiding judge. Proper application of stare decisis is necessary for equal application of the law.

(c)         Judicial Efficiency and Legitimacy

[187]                     Res judicata prevents re-litigation of specific cases. Stare decisis guards against this systemically, by preventing re-litigation of settled law. Both doctrines promote judicial efficiency (Congressional Research Service, “The Supreme Court’s Overruling of Constitutional Precedent”, September 24, 2018, at p. 7; Vavilov, at para. 272, per Abella and Karakatsanis JJ., concurring). Such re‑litigation contributes to delay and a waste of judicial resources (Hryniak v. Mauldin, 2014 SCC 7, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 87; R. v. Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631). Chan is, again, illustrative: since 1998, at least six judges in Ontario have considered the constitutionality of s. 33.1 (see Chan; R. v. Fleming, 2010 ONSC 8022; R. v. Dunn (1999), 28 C.R. (5th) 295 (Ont. C.J. (Gen. Div.)); R. v. Jensen, [2000] O.J. No. 4870 (QL), 2000 CarswellOnt 6489 (WL) (S.C.J.); R. v. Decaire, [1998] O.J. No. 6339 (QL); R. v. Cedeno, 2005 ONCJ 91, 195 C.C.C. (3d) 468). Proper application of stare decisis prevents judicial inefficiency and the associated uncertainty in the law.

[188]                     Stare decisis also upholds the institutional legitimacy of courts, which hinges on public confidence that judges decide cases on a principled basis, rather than simply based on their own views. The public should have confidence that the law will not change simply because the composition of the panel or the court hearing a legal issue changes. There is “a point beyond which frequent overruling would overtax the country’s belief in the Court’s good faith. . . . The legitimacy of the Court would fade with the frequency of its vacillation” (Casey, at p. 866).

[189]                     Legitimacy does not depend on popular agreement with outcomes, but rather is founded on confidence that courts decide cases in accordance with principle. This requires that judges give effect to settled legal principles and depart from them only where a proper basis is shown. In this way, stare decisis is foundational.

(3)         Criticisms of Stare Decisis

[190]                     Two noteworthy criticisms are made of stare decisis. The first is that it is inherently conservative. The second is that courts only adhere to stare decisis when the impugned precedent accords with their personal preference. Both criticisms arise from inconsistent application of stare decisis and both are answered by its proper application.

(a)         Inherent Conservatism

[191]                     Professor E. Craig writes that stare decisis is an “inherently conservative concept and one without any intrinsic value” (“Personal Stare Decisis, HIV Non‑Disclosure, and the Decision in Mabior” (2015), 53 Alta. L. Rev. 207, at p. 208). She argues the doctrine should be abandoned whenever it does not align with the values it is said to serve. See also J. J. Arvay, S. M. Tucker and A. M. Latimer, “Stare Decisis and Constitutional Supremacy: Will Our Charter Past Become an Obstacle to Our Charter Future?” (2012), 58 S.C.L.R. (2d) 61, at p. 62.

[192]                     A principled framework, as we set out below, will enable this Court to revisit precedent in many circumstances that Professor Craig argues may be necessary: i.e., when adhering to precedent perpetuates unworkability or fails to have proper regard to societal or legal change. As well, this Court has revisited precedent in such circumstances for over four decades, albeit without setting out with clarity and consistency a framework for doing so (see, e.g., Ranville).

[193]                     We also reject the notion that stare decisis is inherently conservative. The doctrine has no policy slant. To the contrary, proper application of stare decisis protects progressive development of the law (see, e.g., Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428 (2000), at p. 443, refusing to overturn Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966): “Whether or not we would agree with Miranda’s reasoning and its resulting rule, were we addressing the issue in the first instance, the principles of stare decisis weigh heavily against overruling it now.”). Stare decisis demands judges give sober second thought to revisiting precedent, regardless of the ratio set out within the impugned decision. The framework of analysis we set out is a far cry from the early Beamish-era inelastic conceptualization of stare decisis. The framework facilitates the contemporary development of Canada’s law and, properly applied, does not inappropriately moor this Court to the past.

(b)         Inconsistent Application

[194]                     Some academics suggest that courts apply stare decisis inconsistently, based on their personal opinions (see, e.g., Parkes, at p. S147; D. Stuart, Annotation to United States of America v. Sriskandarajah (2013), 97 C.R. (6th) 268; Congressional Research Service, discussing stare decisis at the Supreme Court of the United States, at pp. 7‑8). For example, Professor D. Parkes explores the connection between the stare decisis framework applied in a particular case and judges’ views on the impugned precedent at issue (pp. S147‑48). The overarching suggestion within these types of criticism is that stare decisis is not a true legal framework — but an illusory concept invoked when courts want to uphold the law and eschewed when courts want to change it.

[195]                     This criticism is not about stare decisis per se. Rather, it highlights the need for a coherent framework of analysis to ensure clarity and consistency. We agree. The framework we set out addresses both unworkability and inconsistent application. Thus, we seek to respond directly to the foregoing criticisms.

(4)         Circumstances in Which This Court May Overturn Its Own Precedent

[196]                     Despite the fundamental importance of stare decisis, this Court has never clearly articulated when it will depart from precedent nor has it settled the framework by which to analyze submissions requesting it do so. This has created uncertainty and led to ad hockery. Parties do not know what arguments to advance or what evidence to lead when seeking to overturn this Court’s precedents. Guidance is needed.

[197]                     With that goal, our analysis proceeds in four parts. First, we explain why the jurisprudence to date is unsatisfactory. Second, we set out a horizontal stare decisis framework to apply going forward. This is a synthesis of common themes that emerge from a careful reading of this Court’s jurisprudence since the Constitution Act, 1982. Third, we identify factors that should not, on their own, provide a basis for overturning precedent. Fourth, we explain the different considerations that apply depending on whether an impugned precedent concerns the common law, statutory interpretation, or a constitutional issue.

(a)           There Is No Settled Framework

[198]                     This Court has never definitively set out the circumstances in which it may depart from precedent. Some decisions have overturned precedent without any discussion of stare decisis (see, e.g., Kosmopoulos v. Constitution Insurance Co., 1987 CanLII 75 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 2; Central Alberta Dairy Pool v. Alberta (Human Rights Commission), 1990 CanLII 76 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 489; British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU, 1999 CanLII 652 (SCC), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3; Nova Scotia (Workers’ Compensation Board) v. Martin, 2003 SCC 54, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 504; Health Services and Support — Facilities Subsector Bargaining Assn. v. British Columbia, 2007 SCC 27, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 391). Others refer to stare decisis but offer little analytical guidance beyond the need for a “compelling reason” to depart from precedent (see, e.g., Ranville, at pp. 527‑28; Hamstra (Guardian ad litem of) v. British Columbia Rugby Union, 1997 CanLII 391 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 1092, at paras. 18‑19; Henry, at para. 44; Craig, at para. 25; Nishi v. Rascal Trucking Ltd., 2013 SCC 33, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 438, at para. 23).

[199]                     On occasion, this Court has offered a set of non‑exhaustive factors. In Bernard, for example, Dickson C.J., dissenting, wrote that the Court should consider four factors: (1) whether the precedent is consistent with the Charter; (2) whether it has been attenuated by subsequent jurisprudence; (3) whether it has created uncertainty; and (4) whether the proposed legal change would broaden the scope of criminal liability, or is otherwise unfavourable to an accused (see also R. v. Chaulk, 1990 CanLII 34 (SCC), [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1303, at p. 1353; R. v. B. (K.G.), 1993 CanLII 116 (SCC), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740, at pp. 777‑78; Fraser, at paras. 134‑37, per Rothstein J., concurring).

[200]                     These factors have not been applied consistently. Some decisions do not refer to the factors; others introduce new criteria, such as whether the decision was decided by “firm majorities” (Craig, at para. 24), is of “recent vintage” (Fraser, at para. 57), or has been subject to judicial, academic and “other” criticism (Nishi, at para. 28; Vavilov, at para. 20).

[201]                     Given the disparate nature of the jurisprudence and the importance of stare decisis, it is necessary to set out a clear and coherent framework. It is open to this Court to do so now for three reasons. First, there is no true precedent of this Court that sets out such a framework. Thus, we are not departing from precedent; rather, we are unifying 40 years of unstructured analysis into a cogent framework. Second, to the extent these reasons depart from any earlier decisions, we justify this on the basis of “unworkability”, discussed below. Finally, the rationale for stare decisis — being foundational to the proper operation of the courts — needs to be vindicated in practice.

(b)         Three Circumstances in Which Overturning Precedent May Be Warranted

[202]                     Our review of the past 40 years of jurisprudence discloses that it is proper for this Court to overturn its precedents where:

1.        The Court rendering the decision failed to have regard to a binding authority or relevant statute (“per incuriam”);

2.         The decision has proven unworkable (“unworkability”); or

3.         The decision’s rationale has been eroded by significant societal or legal change (“foundational erosion”).

[203]                     These three bases are not mutually exclusive. For example, a precedent whose foundation has been eroded may also give rise to issues of workability.

[204]                     The decision to overturn precedent should remain discretionary. While this Court should revisit per incuriam decisions, countervailing considerations may persuade the Court that it is better to uphold unworkable or foundationally eroded precedent. This should be the exception and would need to be justified.

(i)            Per Incuriam

[205]                     Per incuriam means rendering a decision “in ignorance or forgetfulness of the existence of [a] case or . . . statute” (Police Authority for Huddersfield v. Watson, [1947] 1 K.B. 842, at p. 847). To overturn a precedent on this ground, a litigant must show that the Court failed to consider a binding authority or relevant statute and that this failure affected the judgment. Overturning per incuriam decisions promotes stare decisis by affirming that binding authorities or relevant statutes should have been followed but were not.

[206]                     This Court has on occasion rendered a per incuriam decision (see discussion of impugned precedent in R. v. C. (T.L.), 1994 CanLII 57 (SCC), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 1012; see also R. v. George, 1966 CanLII 2 (SCC), [1966] S.C.R. 267, at pp. 277‑79). That said, this will be a rare basis to overturn a decision. We say this for two reasons. First, our Court has the benefit of party and intervener submissions, commonly two lower court decisions on the issue, and rigorous internal processes. Given these safeguards, it is unlikely that binding authority or relevant statute would be forgotten by all. Second, the standard to establish that a decision was decided per incuriam is high. Parties must do more than point to a binding authority or relevant statute ignored within the impugned decision. Parties must show that the judgment would have been different if the court considered the missing binding authority or relevant statute (Rowe and Katz, at pp. 18‑19; Sullivan, at para. 77; Walker v. Bank of Montreal, 2017 SKCA 42, [2017] 12 W.W.R. 130, at para. 25). This Court’s jurisprudential history reveals few decisions indeed that were rendered per incuriam. We have every confidence that decisions rendered on such a basis will be rare in the future.

(ii)         Unworkability

1.            Unworkable Precedents Undermine the Rationales of Stare Decisis

[207]                     An unworkable precedent is one that is unduly complex or difficult to apply in practice. This can take several forms. The unifying factor is that an unworkable precedent undermines at least one of the purposes that stare decisis is intended to promote (legal certainty, the rule of law, judicial efficiency). Several examples will illustrate instances where the Court has overturned precedent on this basis.

a.            Legal Stability and Certainty

[208]                     In Vavilov, this Court overturned precedents on the standard of review for administrative decisions because they were “unclear and unduly complex” (para. 21). Litigants and courts routinely struggled to determine the applicable standard of review (paras. 20‑21). This led to frequent appeals as to the standard of review and its proper application (see, e.g., Areva Resources Canada Inc. v. Saskatchewan (Minister of Energy and Resources), 2013 SKCA 79, 417 Sask. R. 182; Rogers Communications Inc. v. Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada, 2012 SCC 35, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 283). Administrative law was in a state of uncertainty. Revisiting precedent was justified in the circumstances so as to “promote the values underlying stare decisis” by making the law more “certain, coherent and workable going forward” (Vavilov, at para. 22).

[209]                     In Ranville, at pp. 526‑28, the Court revisited the confusing “persona designata” concept as courts struggled to use it in practice. Since “adherence to the stare decisis principle would generate more uncertainty than certainty”, the Court overturned this line of precedent (p. 528).

[210]                     In Henry, the Court overturned a s. 13 Charter precedent in part because courts and juries struggled to give effect to an “unduly and unnecessarily complex and technical” framework (para. 45, citing Bernard, at p. 859; see also paras. 42‑44).

[211]                     In Nishi, at paras. 24‑28, this Court refused to overturn precedents because the litigants failed to establish that the law was uncertain. To the contrary, the precedents provided “certainty and predictability” (para. 28). There was therefore no compelling reason for overturning them.

[212]                     In Teva Canada Ltd. v. TD Canada Trust, 2017 SCC 51, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 317, the majority refused to overturn precedents because they had “served the commercial world for 40 years without serious complaint from that world” (para. 67). In contrast, the dissent would have overturned the precedents because, in their view, adhering to them would perpetuate legal uncertainty; the precedents were “unnecessarily complex and elusive” and “undermined certainty as courts have struggled to apply” them (paras. 141‑46). It is noteworthy that the majority and dissent parted ways on the basis of whether the precedents had given rise to uncertainty.

b.      Rule of Law

[213]                     The Court can overturn precedents that have the effect of undermining the rule of law by making the law indeterminate and subject to a judge’s idiosyncratic preferences, rather than a principled framework. Jordan is illustrative. Jordan overturned R. v. Morin, 1992 CanLII 89 (SCC), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 771, because lower courts had not been applying Morin’s s. 11(b) framework consistently (see, e.g., the decision to set aside a stay of proceedings in R. v. Stilwell, 2014 ONCA 563, 313 C.C.C. (3d) 257). The application of s. 11(b) had become “something of a dice roll” (Jordan, at para. 32). An accused’s s. 11(b) rights turned in large part on the views of the judge hearing the case, rather than on a consistently applied framework. This undermined the rule of law.

[214]                     In Bernard, Dickson C.J., dissenting, would have overturned a precedent because its framework classified offences in an “ad hoc, unpredictable” manner, which made it difficult for accused persons to know what defences were available to them (pp. 858‑60).

[215]                     In R. v. Kapp, 2008 SCC 41, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 483, at paras. 21‑22, the Court effectively overturned a s. 15 Charter precedent that made “human dignity” the basis for a legal test because it was an abstract, subjective concept that was not applied consistently. This made the scope of a claimant’s s. 15 Charter right indeterminate.

c.      Judicial Efficiency

[216]                     The Court can overturn precedents that are unnecessarily complex or cumbersome. Such decisions needlessly drain judicial resources. For example, Vetrovec v. The Queen, 1982 CanLII 20 (SCC), [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811, changed the law on accomplice testimony because technicalities in the existing framework had created judicial inefficiencies (pp. 817‑18 and 824‑25). Lower courts and juries struggled to apply the framework, and numerous appeals turned on the intricacies of the law. The result was that a simple common sense proposition — that an accomplice’s testimony should be viewed with caution — was “transformed into a difficult and highly technical area of law” that needlessly took up too much court time (pp. 825‑26). In these circumstances, departing from stare decisis was proper so as to achieve judicial efficiency.

2.            Demonstrating Unworkability

[217]                     Parties seeking to overturn precedent on the basis of unworkability need to demonstrate that a precedent undermines the goals of stare decisis. It is not enough for litigants to assert baldly, as the Crown did here, that a precedent has been applied in an “uneven and unpredictable” manner, creates “uncertainty”, or is doctrinally incoherent (transcript, at pp. 53, 59 and 83).

[218]                     Jordan is instructive on this point. To support their intervention seeking clarifications to Morin, the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association referred to numerous decisions that had denied relief under s. 11(b) “even in the face of delay far beyond what was contemplated in Morin” (see I.F., Jordan, at para. 18, fn. 35). The intervener factum of the Criminal Lawyers’ Association (Ontario) in Jordan, at paras. 8‑9, took a similar approach. These submissions demonstrated unworkability, rather than merely asserting it.

(iii)      Foundational Erosion

[219]                     This Court has also departed from precedent where fundamental changes undermine the rationale of the precedent. This can occur in two ways, through: (1) societal change (e.g., social, economic, or technological change in Canadian society), or (2) legal change, such as constitutional amendments (e.g., the introduction of the Charter) or, incrementally, when subsequent jurisprudence “attenuates” a precedent.

[220]                     Such change must be significant and lasting. It typically takes years, if not decades, to emerge. Passing trends or temporary shifts will not suffice. Further, the change must arise after the precedent was decided.

[221]                     This Court can properly overturn eroded precedent. This is because the values underlying stare decisis are not the only ones that the legal system is designed to promote. Strict adherence to precedents based solely on workability would lead eventually to a stagnant legal system: the “common law of England” deemed women “not in general . . . capable of exercising public functions” for many years (De Souza v. Cobden, [1891] 1 Q.B. 687 (C.A.), at p. 691). While such a rule may have remained “workable”, the law must evolve alongside the country (Sharpe, at p. 159). While our justice system must retain a high degree of certainty and stability, it must also be just and responsive to the needs of contemporary Canadian society.

1.            Societal Change (Social, Economic, Technological)

[222]                     This Court can overturn its decisions when fundamental change to societal conditions undermine the decision’s rationale. These changes either render the concerns underlying the precedent moot or inconsistent with contemporary societal norms (Sriskandarajah, at para. 19). These changes can come in various forms: (i) social, (ii) economic, or (iii) technological.

[223]                     We provide examples of precedents overturned by virtue of societal change under these three headings. By so doing, we do not suggest that these are mutually exclusive; rather, societal change may well manifest itself from several of these perspectives. However characterized, such changes must reflect broad and fundamental shifts in society in order to undermine the rationale for a precedent.

a.            Social Change

[224]                     This Court can overturn a precedent when the social considerations animating the decision are no longer relevant. In Tolofson v. Jensen, 1994 CanLII 44 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 1022, the Court overturned McLean v. Pettigrew, 1944 CanLII 69 (SCC), [1945] S.C.R. 62, because the social concerns animating McLean had dissipated. McLean endorsed a private international law rule that allowed a litigant to apply the law from their home province to actionable wrongs committed in a different province (pp. 69‑70). The rule from McLean originated in 19th century England. The decision’s rationale was grounded in part on two “social considerations” (Tolofson, at p. 1053). First, England was a colonial power. The country had little concern about extending its law to foreign states at the time. Second, there were practical issues with proving the law of a foreign country in English courts because transportation and communication was difficult.

[225]                     These concerns were no longer persuasive when Tolofson was decided (p. 1053). Information could be communicated with relative ease, and society’s views on international relations had shifted in a way that favoured comity and sovereignty. This left “no compelling reason” for following McLean (pp. 1050‑54).

[226]                     Brooks v. Canada Safeway Ltd., 1989 CanLII 96 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1219, overturned Bliss v. Attorney General of Canada, 1978 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1979] 1 S.C.R. 183, because the impugned decision perpetuated inequities no longer acceptable in Canadian society. Bliss held that legislation disentitling pregnant women from receiving certain unemployment benefits did not discriminate against women on the basis of sex. Bliss reasoned that the legislation discriminated against pregnancy, not sex, as the legislation treated women differently because they were pregnant, and not because they were women. As more women entered the workforce and suffered the disadvantage sanctioned by Bliss, attitudes shifted. It became clear that drawing a distinction between pregnancy and sex was illogical and allowed employers to discriminate against women. Dickson C.J. concluded that Bliss “would not be decided now as it was decided then” because it was now “obvious” that those who bear children should not be economically or socially disadvantaged (p. 1243). Society had changed and stare decisis did not demand perpetuation of discriminatory practices (pp. 1243‑44).

[227]                     In United States v. Burns, 2001 SCC 7, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 283, this Court effectively overturned precedents as to when Canada would extradite those facing the death penalty. The Court justified this change partially on shifts in society’s views regarding capital punishment. Burns reasoned that Canadians’ strong aversion to the death penalty and the growing evidence showing that wrongful convictions are more common than once thought justified changing the law (paras. 76‑77 and 95‑117).

b.      Economic Change

[228]                     This Court can overturn precedent if economic change affects the concerns underlying the decision. Hamstra overturned Bowhey v. Theakston, 1951 CanLII 6 (SCC), [1951] S.C.R. 679, because of the greatly increased insurance coverage in Canada. Theakston required judges to discharge juries if they became aware of information suggesting that a defendant was insured (Hamstra, at paras. 11‑12). This rule was designed to protect trial integrity, the concern being that awareness of insurance coverage would bias a jury in favour of the plaintiff since an insurer would pay the awarded damages (paras. 11‑12). However, by the time of the decision in Hamstra, Canadians had become aware that many defendants had insurance, particularly for automobiles (para. 19). Accordingly, “the rationale for the [old] rule [was] no longer valid” and this Court overturned Theakston (Hamstra, at para. 19).

c.      Technological Change

[229]                     This Court can overturn precedent if technological change affects the concerns underlying the decision. In Deacon v. The King, 1947 CanLII 38 (SCC), [1947] S.C.R. 531, this Court adopted the orthodox rule that held that parties could use a witness’s prior inconsistent statements only to impeach a witness’s credibility (Deacon, at p. 534). The rationale behind the orthodox rule was that most out of court statements were unreliable and could not be properly assessed since the trier of fact could not see the witness’s demeanour (see B. (K.G.), at p. 792).

[230]                     In B (K.G.), the Court relied on the use of video recording to justify changing the law on prior inconsistent statements. The Court reasoned that the “rationale for the orthodox rule”, as adopted in Deacon, had been “attenuated by changes in the methods of proof and demonstration in the modern trial process” — namely, readily accessible videotaping (pp. 780‑81). This allowed the trier of fact to assess the witness’s demeanour, which addressed some of the hearsay concerns animating Deacon. B. (K.G.) overturned Deacon and created a new rule: in limited circumstances, such as when the statement is videotaped, a prior inconsistent statement of a non-accused witness could be used for the truth of its contents.

2.            Demonstrating Societal Changes That Warrant Overturning Precedent

[231]                     Just as parties seeking to overturn a precedent based on unworkability need to demonstrate unworkability, so too must those seeking to overturn precedent based on societal change demonstrate such change. In Burns, parties adduced evidence demonstrating that: wrongful convictions are more common than had been thought, inmates suffer serious psychological trauma on death row, and views on capital punishment had shifted. Through this evidence, the parties demonstrated societal change, rather than merely asserting it.

[232]                     It is much preferable for such evidence to be led at trial, where it can be thoroughly tested. Trial judges hear a high volume of cases and develop expertise in assessing the testimony of witnesses and other evidence (R. v. Suter, 2018 SCC 34, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 496, at para. 164, per Gascon J., dissenting in part, but not on this point; R. D. Gibbens, “Appellate Review of Findings of Fact” (1991-92), 13 Advocates’ Q. 445, at p. 446, cited in Housen, at para. 14). If parties seek to challenge precedent at first instance, on the basis of the vertical stare decisis framework set out in Bedford and Carter, we would expect there to be a full evidentiary record on societal change. However, if evidence is not adduced at trial, then a party should seek to adduce fresh evidence before the Court of Appeal, where it may be assessed by that court. As a method of last resort, this Court may choose to receive fresh evidence where parties seek to demonstrate societal change as the basis to overturn a precedent. We would stress that parties should make an application to adduce fresh evidence, rather than burying evidence in academic articles and footnotes of their written submissions. Opposing parties should have the opportunity to address such applications and plan their submissions accordingly.

3.            Legal Change

[233]                     The Court has overturned precedents when legal change has undermined the decision’s foundation. Legal change may arise from constitutional amendments, notably the adoption of the Charter, as well as by the release of subsequent decisions “attenuating” the precedent (see, e.g., R. v. Tutton, 1989 CanLII 103 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1392, at pp. 1410‑11, per Wilson J., concurring; Bernard, at pp. 855‑56, per Dickson C.J., dissenting, but not on this point; R. v. Hynes, 2001 SCC 82, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 623, at paras. 116 and 119, per Major J., dissenting, but not on this point; Nishi, at para. 24; R. v. Alex, 2017 SCC 37, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 967, at para. 95, per Rowe J., dissenting, but not on this point).

[234]                     The need to revisit precedents that conflict with the Constitution is clear: see R. v. Robinson, 1996 CanLII 233 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 683 (overturning MacAskill v. The King, 1931 CanLII 58 (SCC), [1931] S.C.R. 330, on the defence of intoxication because it was inconsistent with ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter and not saved by s. 1); R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., 1985 CanLII 69 (SCC), [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295 (overturning Robertson and Rosetanni v. The Queen, 1963 CanLII 17 (SCC), [1963] S.C.R. 651, on the meaning of “freedom of religion”); R. v. Therens, 1985 CanLII 29 (SCC), [1985] 1 S.C.R. 613 (overturning Chromiak v. The Queen, 1979 CanLII 181 (SCC), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 471, on the meaning of “detention”).

[235]                     By contrast, the point at which subsequent decisions have “attenuated” a precedent sufficiently so as to warrant overturning it is more difficult to define. The jurisprudence reveals a common theme justifying departure from precedent: the precedent relies on principles or gives effect to purposes inconsistent with those underlying the Court’s subsequent decisions.

[236]                     In R. v. Beaulac, 1999 CanLII 684 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 768, the Court overturned cases regarding s. 133 of the Constitution Act, 1867 and s. 16 of the Charter that had failed to promote official language communities and their culture (paras. 16‑25). This was inconsistent with later decisions which affirmed the importance of broadly interpreting language rights (paras. 17‑21).

[237]                     Brooks overturned Bliss in part because it was inconsistent with the contemporary approach to interpreting human rights legislation (pp. 1244‑46).

[238]                     Hamstra overturned Theakston in part because its skepticism of juries was undercut by subsequent jurisprudence that reaffirmed confidence in juries (paras. 15‑17, 23 and 25).

[239]                     B. (K.G.) overturned Deacon in part because it was attenuated by subsequent cases which provided for a more flexible approach to hearsay evidence (p. 780).

[240]                     Clark v. Canadian National Railway Co., 1988 CanLII 18 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 680, at pp. 704‑9, overturned precedent interpreting the scope of federal powers over railways because it was inconsistent with later s. 92(10) jurisprudence, which cautioned against an overly broad reading of exclusive federal jurisdiction.

[241]                     Ordon Estate v. Grail, 1998 CanLII 771 (SCC), [1998] 3 S.C.R. 437, at paras. 70‑71 and 94, overturned a precedent because it was inconsistent with the principles of maritime law in subsequent cases.

4.            Demonstrating When Changes in the Law Warrant Overturning Precedent

[242]                     While this Court may overturn precedent if it is demonstrated that the decision is unworkable or has been foundationally eroded, this decision should remain discretionary. Two factors should guide the exercise of this discretion.

[243]                     First, the Court should consider whether overturning the precedent would result in unforeseeable or unpredictable change. In such circumstances, change is better undertaken by the legislature rather than by the courts. The legislature is better equipped to study and weigh the costs and benefits of significant legal change (Watkins, at pp. 760‑64; R. v. Hawkins, 1996 CanLII 154 (SCC), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1043, at paras. 42‑51; R. v. Hodgson, 1998 CanLII 798 (SCC), [1998] 2 S.C.R. 449, at para. 29; Friedmann Equity Developments Inc. v. Final Note Ltd., 2000 SCC 34, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 842, at paras. 48‑52). Our Court has used this reasoning to uphold potentially outdated common law rules (see Hodgson). Similar reasoning can apply more broadly to upholding unworkable or eroded precedents, pending legislative reform.

[244]                     Second, the Court should be mindful of whether overturning precedent would have the effect of expanding criminal liability (see, e.g., B. (K.G.), at pp. 781‑83; R. v. Prokofiew, 2012 SCC 49, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 639, at para. 66, per Fish J., dissenting, but not on this point). Since changes in the law through judicial decisions operate retrospectively, overturning a precedent that limited or circumscribed criminal liability would effectively criminalize previously unpunishable conduct (Bernard, at pp. 860‑61). This is inconsistent with the fundamental requirement of criminal law that people must know what constitutes punishable conduct and what does not. Punishing “people for conduct that they could not have reasonably known was criminal is Kafkaesque and anathema to our notions of justice” (R. v. Mabior, 2012 SCC 47, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 584, at para. 14). Accordingly, only Parliament is permitted to expand the scope of criminal liability, and they must generally do so prospectively (see R. v. D.L.W., 2016 SCC 22, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 402, at para. 57, citing Frey v. Fedoruk, 1950 CanLII 24 (SCC), [1950] S.C.R. 517; Charter, ss. 11(g) and 11(i)). This Court should avoid overturning precedent when doing so would overstep its institutional role, especially in this way.

(c)         Factors That Should Not Provide a Basis to Overturn Precedent

[245]                     Our framework does not refer to all the factors this Court has previously referenced in deciding whether to overturn precedent. While some of those factors are implicit in our framework, some are not. This is so because they are not relevant to the purposes of stare decisis, as outlined above. In this regard, we elaborate on five factors, and their relevance to horizontal stare decisis: (1) judicial or academic criticism; (2) divergence from foreign jurisprudence; (3) whether the decision is plainly “wrong”; (4) the age of the precedent; and (5) whether the decision was the result of a “strong” majority.

(i)            Judicial or Academic Criticism

[246]                     As we have already indicated, the fact that a decision is subject to judicial or academic criticism is not, on its own, reason to overturn it. Such criticism can be relevant, but only to the extent that it demonstrates that the decision was rendered per incuriam, is unworkable or foundationally eroded.

[247]                     To allow criticism, as an unbounded concept, to justify revisiting precedent would subjugate principle to popular views. This Court has made, and undoubtedly in future will make, decisions with which others will disagree. Commentary and debate is productive to the development of the law. But, precedential force cannot hinge on popularity. Stare decisis is fundamental to the legitimacy of the judiciary. Our court cannot overturn precedent simply because a chorus of voices, even well-informed voices, expresses disagreement with our decisions (Vavilov, at para. 274, per Abella and Karakatsanis JJ., concurring).

[248]                     All that said, judicial or academic criticism of a precedent can be highly persuasive where it demonstrates that the precedent was rendered per incuriam, is unworkable, or its societal or legal foundations are eroded. In such circumstances, the Court may well overturn a precedent on those bases, but not because of the existence of criticism per se.

[249]                     Trial judges are particularly well‑placed to observe and comment on such matters. They “apply the procedure in a great variety of cases and thus have much firsthand experience bearing on its advantages and disadvantages” (Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223 (2009), at p. 231). For example, in Tolofson, in deciding whether to overturn McLean, La Forest J. reviewed a series of trial decisions which questioned the outcome demanded by the precedent.

(ii)         Divergence From Foreign Jurisprudence

[250]                     The fact that a precedent is inconsistent with foreign jurisprudence is not a reason to overturn it. Foreign jurisprudence is not binding and its persuasive significance needs to be considered in a structured, careful way.

[251]                     That said, foreign jurisprudence can be instructive. For example, it can be useful to demonstrate: (a) that complexity causing unworkability could be ameliorated by adopting an alternative approach; (b) that changing the law would not have unforeseeable repercussions, as other jurisdictions have implemented the change without such consequences (see, e.g., Bow Valley Husky (Bermuda) Ltd. v. Saint John Shipbuilding Ltd., 1997 CanLII 307 (SCC), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1210); (c) that reform is better undertaken by the legislature, given the difficulties that other jurisdictions have encountered when courts changed the law (see, e.g., Hodgson, at paras. 28‑29); or (d) support for other arguments within our horizontal stare decisis framework (see, e.g., Robinson, at para. 35).

(iii)      That the Precedent Was “Wrongly” Decided

[252]                     Phrases like “plainly wrong” and “manifest error” are, too often, pejorative descriptors used as a façade to disguise mere disagreement (Queensland, at p. 603). If a panel of this Court can simply disregard any decision with which it disagrees, then stare decisis would cease in any meaningful way to exist and the criticisms of Professor Craig, referred to above, would be well‑founded. The doctrine has consequence only to the extent that it sustains decisions that judges themselves would not render. Stare decisis has no role to play with respect to judgments mirroring what a judge would have decided independent of the impugned precedent (Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U.S. 446 (2015), at p. 455; see also, on this point, Willers, at para. 7; R. v. Knuller (Publishing, Printing and Promotions) Ltd., [1973] A.C. 435 (H.L.), cited in R. v. Cunningham, [1982] A.C. 566 (H.L.), at pp. 581‑82; Queensland, at pp. 597‑99 and 602‑4, per Gibbs and Stephen JJ., concurring). True analytical “error” in a precedent will manifest itself as unworkability or erosion by subsequent legal change (see, e.g., Ranville).

[253]                     That the Court believes that one of its own cases was wrongly decided is not a proper basis for overturning precedent. Were this so, each itineration of the Court’s membership could remake the law as they saw fit. In our common law tradition, this cannot be the case.

(iv)        Age of the Precedent

[254]                     The age of a precedent is not relevant to whether the Court may overturn it. There is no magic “best before” date after which it becomes open season for the Court to revisit precedent, nor is there any arbitrary period before which it cannot be reconsidered.

[255]                     The Court has been inconsistent on the relevance of the “age” of a precedent. Sometimes, the Court has suggested that it should not overturn a precedent because it is recent (see, e.g., Fraser, at para. 57; Prokofiew, at para. 66, per Fish J., dissenting; R. v. Nedelcu, 2012 SCC 59, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 311, at para. 115, per LeBel J., dissenting; R. v. Cody, 2017 SCC 31, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 659, at para. 3). Other times, the Court has suggested that it should be more difficult to overturn longstanding precedents because they have engendered reliance (see, e.g., Hawkins; Friedmann Equity Developments Inc., at para. 47). This inconsistency suggests that the precedent’s age is not what is impelling the decision of whether it ought to be overturned.

[256]                     That said, unworkability and foundational erosion require time to materialize. In this sense, newer precedents are less likely to be overturned.

(v)         The Presence or Absence of a “Strong Majority”

[257]                     Whether a decision is the product of a “firm” or “strong” majority should not be relevant to the stare decisis framework. The precedential weight of a decision does not depend on how many judges signed onto it — once a majority is achieved, it becomes a binding decision (see, e.g., Ross v. The Queen (1895), 1895 CanLII 113 (SCC), 25 S.C.R. 564, per Strong C.J.; see also Neuman v. M.N.R., 1998 CanLII 826 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 770, at para. 27). The majority decision in Alberta v. Hutterian Brethren of Wilson Colony, 2009 SCC 37, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 567 — set out by four judges — is of no less precedential weight than is R. v. Khawaja, 2012 SCC 69, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 555 — a unanimous decision. Dissenting reasons may assist future panels to identify unworkability or foundational erosion. But how many judges dissent should not be relevant to how “easily” a precedent can be overturned.

[258]                     In so saying, we recognize that this Court has alluded to the relevance of a “firm” or “strong” majority when considering whether to overturn a precedent (see, e.g., Fraser, at para. 57; Craig, at para. 24; Nedelcu, at para. 114; Nishi, at para. 23; Mounted Police Association of Ontario v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 1, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 167 and 211, per Rothstein J., dissenting; R. v. Nur, 2015 SCC 15, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 773, at para. 59; Teva Canada Ltd., at para. 139, per Côté and Rowe JJ., dissenting; Vavilov, at para. 255, per Abella and Karakatsanis JJ., concurring).

[259]                     It is time to close this door. A decision of the Court is no less a precedent when there is dissent, regardless of how many judges disagree with the majority. To say otherwise is to suggest that what really matters is the composition of the Court as it changes over time. This would not be a principled basis on which to decide the law. Indeed, it would undermine the rule of law and the legitimacy of judicial authority.

(d)         Differences in Applying Stare Decisis in Cases Involving Statutory Interpretation, Common Law, and Constitutional Precedents

[260]                     This framework for horizontal stare decisis is intended to apply to all statutory interpretation, common law, and constitutional precedents of the Court. However, it is important to acknowledge differences between these types of precedents.

(i)            Statutory Interpretation

[261]                     As the meaning of a statute is fixed at the time of enactment, it is not open to this Court to overturn precedent on the basis that a statute’s meaning has changed over time (Big M Drug Mart Ltd., at pp. 334‑35; Clark, at pp. 703‑4; McLean v. British Columbia (Securities Commission), 2013 SCC 67, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 895, at para. 46). It is not open to parties to argue, as they do in the present case, that social change has altered the meaning of a particular provision of the Criminal Code. If the passage of time renders the statute inconsistent with contemporary social reality, it is the legislature that must remedy the statute’s deficiencies; it is not for the courts to do so.

[262]                     This does not mean that the Court can never revisit a precedent based on statutory interpretation. Rather, it means that to do so it must be shown that the Court misconstrued the legislature’s intent. For example, unworkability can indicate that the Court failed properly to comprehend legislative intent, as legislatures are presumed to have intended to pass workable laws (see Ranville). A party should not, as did the Crown in this case, seek to overturn a precedent simply by re-litigating the interpretation undertaken by a different panel (Big M Drug Mart Ltd., at pp. 334‑35).

(ii)         Common Law

[263]                     The Court must ensure that the common law develops in line with societal change (Salituro, at p. 670). If such changes render a common law rule inconsistent with contemporary social reality, the Court can and should reform the common law to accord with those changed realities.

[264]                     That said, given the institutional limitations of the courts with respect to public policy, they should be inclined to change the common law only incrementally (Bow Valley Husky (Bermuda) Ltd., at para. 93, per McLachlin J. (as she then was), dissenting in part, but not on this point; Hodgson, at para. 29; Salituro, at p. 670). Legislatures have the capacity to study and assess consequences of major legal changes. By contrast, courts have limited capacity to comprehend the collateral effects that may flow from changing the law (Watkins). The courts’ approach to developing the common law needs to be mindful of these realities.

(iii)      Constitutional Law

[265]                     Constitutional precedents must remain workable and responsive to the realities of contemporary society (see, e.g., Reference re Same-Sex Marriage, 2004 SCC 79, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 698, at paras. 22 and 30; Reference re Employment Insurance Act (Can.), ss. 22 and 23, 2005 SCC 56, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 669, at paras. 9‑10; Comeau, at paras. 33 and 52; Reference re Code of Civil Procedure (Que.), art. 35, 2021 SCC 27, at paras. 53‑54). Unlike statutes, the meaning of a constitutional provision is “capable of growth” and may be revisited on the basis of societal change (Quebec (Attorney General) v. 9147-0732 Québec inc., 2020 SCC 32, at para. 8, quoting British Columbia (Attorney General) v. Canada (Attorney General), 1994 CanLII 81 (SCC), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 41, at p. 88). This Court can also overturn unworkable constitutional precedents (see Kapp, at paras. 21‑22).

[266]                     The ability to revisit constitutional precedent is not an unbridled licence to reinterpret the Constitution. Interpretation of the Constitution must be anchored in the historical context of the provision in issue and the natural limits of the text (R. v. Blais, 2003 SCC 44, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 236, at para. 40; Hislop, at para. 94).

(5)         Conclusion: Stare Decisis

[267]                     To summarize, this Court can only overturn its own precedents if that precedent (1) was rendered per incuriam, (2) is unworkable, or (3) has had its foundation eroded by significant societal or legal change. All per incuriam decisions should be overturned. But an unworkable or eroded precedent may be upheld if overturning the decision would result in unforeseeable change or expand criminal liability.

[268]                     Litigants should now use this test when asking this Court to overturn a precedent. They need to clearly establish that a missing authority affected the decision, thereby rendering it per incuriam. Or they must come armed with evidence establishing unworkability or foundational erosion. They should no longer argue that a precedent should be overturned because it is (1) subject to judicial or academic criticism, (2) diverges from foreign jurisprudence, (3) is “wrong” in the eyes of some, (4) is a new or old precedent, or (5) was decided by a narrow majority.

[269]                     With this framework in mind, we will now apply it to the facts of this case. As we explain below, there is no basis for overturning Hutchinson.

C.            None of the Circumstances for Overturning Precedent Apply to Hutchinson

[270]                     In this section, we apply the horizontal stare decisis framework arising from long-standing jurisprudence of this Court to Hutchinson, the precedent impugned by our colleague, the Crown, and certain interveners to this appeal. We conclude that none of the circumstances that may warrant overturning precedent apply to Hutchinson. Accordingly, the ratio decidendi of Hutchinson must govern this appeal.

[271]                     Our application of the horizontal stare decisis framework proceeds in four parts. First, we reject our colleague’s suggestion that Hutchinson was rendered per incuriam. Second, we conclude that the Crown has failed to show Hutchinson is unworkable. Third, we demonstrate that no foundational erosion has occurred with respect to Hutchinson and explain, in particular, why any relevant societal change that may have transpired since Hutchinson is for Parliament to reconcile, not the courts. Finally, in the alternative, we discuss why we would decline to exercise our discretion to overturn Hutchinson, even if overturning precedent were warranted here.

(1)         Hutchinson Was Not Rendered Per Incuriam

[272]                     Any suggestion that Hutchinson was rendered per incuriam is meritless. The Crown’s position, at its highest, is that excluding condom use from consent under s. 273.1(1) is “inconsistent” with long-standing sexual assault jurisprudence, such as R. v. Ewanchuk, 1999 CanLII 711 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330, and R. v. J.A., 2011 SCC 28, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 440. Notably, the Crown does not say, as our colleague does, at para. 87, that Hutchinson “does not consider this Court’s jurisprudence on consent” (emphasis added). And for good reason; this is wrong. The Hutchinson majority cited Ewanchuk repeatedly (at paras. 1, 4, 17 and 27), while using the term “consent” no less than 124 times in its reasons for judgment. Further, J.A. is explicitly cited by the Hutchinson minority, at para. 86, where it notes that “the relevant time for determining . . . consent is when the activity occurred”. Since J.A. was cited by the minority, it is implausible that the majority could have neglected to consider the case. We believe this point obvious, unless our colleague is suggesting that the majority did not read the minority’s opinion.

[273]                     As such, the Crown cannot demonstrate (nor has it even attempted to) that the Hutchinson panel ignored binding precedent, much less that the result would have been different had it considered an allegedly overlooked authority. The reason for this is simple: all relevant authorities were expressly considered by the Hutchinson Court. Further, as we have already noted, the failure to consider binding precedent would be grounds for overturning Hutchinson, not a basis for reading its ratio so narrowly that it may be “distinguished”, as our colleague purports to do. In fact, some of the interveners in this appeal fairly recognize that Hutchinson has a role to play within this Court’s jurisprudence on sexual assault law (I.F., Barbra Schlifer Commemorative Clinic, at para. 21; I.F., HIV & AIDS Legal Clinic Ontario and HIV Legal Network, at para. 10). Yet our colleague steadfastly refuses to acknowledge that this Court’s sexual assault jurisprudence includes within its ambit not only decisions such as Ewanchuk and J.A., which emphasized the importance of affirmative consent, but also R. v. Cuerrier, 1998 CanLII 796 (SCC), [1998] 2 S.C.R. 371, and Mabior, which were designed to ensure legal certainty and avoid over-criminalization of individuals living with HIV.

[274]                     To fasten the scarlet letter of per incuriam to a decision of this Court requires more than mere disagreement. In our view, the requisite stringent threshold for doing so is not met here. Accordingly, we see no possible basis on which to overturn Hutchinson as per incuriam.

(2)         Hutchinson Is Not Unworkable

[275]                     The Crown has also failed to demonstrate that Hutchinson is unworkable. Far from creating uncertainty, the raison d’être of Hutchinson was to provide a bright line rule for interpreting “the sexual activity in question” under s. 273.1(1). The Hutchinson rule consigns all forms of deception involving contraception, including condom use or non‑use, to the fraud analysis under s. 265(3)(c). By contrast, re‑interpreting s. 273.1(1) in the manner our colleague suggests — i.e., by distinguishing between two nearly identical forms of “physicality” — would re‑introduce the modified “essential features” approach advanced by the Hutchinson minority and explicitly rejected by the majority (Hutchinson, at para. 45). We have already explained why this method of examining consent is confusing and may lead to over-criminalization, particularly amongst already marginalized communities. The majority, per McLachlin C.J. and Cromwell J., wisely made a similar point in Hutchinson, at paras. 45 and 46, holding that such an approach is the very antithesis of workability:

[The minority] introduce a variation on [the “essential features”] approach but one which, as we see it, is equally uncertain. Under their approach, the “sexual activity in question” extends to “how” the sexual touching occurs, but not to the consequences of the sexual activity. But it is not clear what the “how” of the act includes, or whether agreement is undermined by only deception or also by a complainant’s unilateral mistake. Presumably, it extends to any physical aspect of the sexual activity to which the complainant has not agreed in advance — a vast swath of conduct indeed. And again, the line is blurry; many aspects of the sexual activity can be characterized as both part of the “how” and part of the consequences. . . .

 

These approaches would also result in the criminalization of acts that should not attract the heavy hand of the criminal law. We have already noted the difficulty of seeing why the presence of a sexually transmitted infection would not be a “component” of the sexual activity or part of “how” the sexual touching occurs. Under the . . . “essential features” test, a man who pierces a condom may be found guilty of sexual assault; why would a woman who lies about birth control measures not be equally guilty? Under [the minority’s] test, the quality or effectiveness of a condom changes the sexual activity that takes place; why would it not follow that an individual might be prosecuted for using an expired condom or a particular brand of condom? Anomalies abound. The “how the physical act was carried out” test appears not to capture a woman who lies about taking birth control pills, but it might well capture a woman who lies about using a diaphragm. [Underlining added.]

[276]                     Neither the Crown nor our colleague have pointed to a plenary body of case law that demonstrates the ratio from Hutchinson has proven unworkable. That is because such case law does not exist. As we have already demonstrated (at paras. 145‑56, above) the post-Hutchinson jurisprudence discloses no workability problems. At most, it may be said that a tiny fraction of reviewing judges simply disagree with Hutchinson. Indeed, our colleague is entitled to disagree with Hutchinson. However, horizontal stare decisis ensures that precedents like Hutchinson continue to bind this Court, notwithstanding putative disagreement amongst lower courts — and even individual members of the Court itself — as to their “correctness”. In this way, the proper application of stare decisis stabilizes our legal system and safeguards the rule of law.

[277]                     Likewise, and as we have already noted, the academic criticism levied against Hutchinson, distilled to its essence, suggests that it was wrongly decided. The writings cited by our colleague and the Crown do not identify any unworkability arising from Hutchinson that might warrant overturning it. Indeed, the authors point toward cases (the very same cases erroneously cited by our colleague) that do not actually impugn Hutchinson in a manner that would justify overturning it (see, e.g., Gotell and Grant, at pp. 459 and 464‑71). To repeat: the existence of criticism alone is insufficient to justify departing from a precedent delivered by a conscientious panel of this Court.

[278]                     In short, Hutchinson provides a clear, workable framework for analyzing consent to “the sexual activity in question” in s. 273.1(1). Beyond bald assertions, neither our colleague nor the Crown has demonstrated that lower courts have had any difficulty applying Hutchinson. No legitimate argument has been put forth to overturn Hutchinson on the ground of unworkability. In our respectful view, this is because no such argument exists.

(3)         There Is No Foundational Erosion Undermining Hutchinson

[279]                     Finally, the Crown has not shown any foundational erosion that would undermine the precedential force of Hutchinson. As we will explain, any societal change that may have occurred since Hutchinson cannot change Parliament’s legislative intent as authoritatively interpreted by the Hutchinson Court. Further, the Crown has not pointed to any legal change that could warrant overturning Hutchinson.

(a)         Societal Change Cannot Undermine Hutchinson

[280]                     It may fairly be argued that social attitudes regarding sexual violence, or the prevalence of certain sexual behaviours, has shifted since the release of Hutchinson in 2014. However, as we have explained, precedents which authoritatively interpret a statute are not susceptible to shifting social mores or trends. The Hutchinson Court determined the meaning of the words “the sexual activity in question” as Parliament intended. In doing so, the Hutchinson majority was alive to Parliament’s “concerns about sexual violence against women and children” and, in particular, the pressing need to protect ss. 7 and 15 Charter rights in the context of sexualized violence (para. 27). The fact that the issue of “stealthing”, for example, may now be more prevalent or prominent in the public consciousness does nothing to erode the precedential foundation of Hutchinson, which interpreted the meaning of s. 273.1(1) of the Criminal Code. The statutory interpretation set out therein therefore reflects Parliament’s intent at the time of enactment. If the passage of time has rendered this statutory provision inconsistent with contemporary social reality, it is for the legislature — not the courts — to further study and, if necessary, to remedy any alleged deficiency.

(b)         There Is No Legal Change Attenuating Hutchinson

[281]                     Finally, we see no constitutional or jurisprudential developments post‑Hutchinson that would attenuate its precedential value.

[282]                     This Court’s recent sexual assault jurisprudence builds upon foundational precedents like Ewanchuk and J.A. (see, e.g., R. v. G.F., 2021 SCC 20; Goldfinch; Barton), which were duly considered by the Hutchinson Court. Crucially, however, these recent cases do not purport to displace Hutchinson’s clear and categorical interpretation of “the sexual activity in question” under s. 273.1(1) as excluding condom use. To the contrary, as we have discussed, in Goldfinch and Barton this Court expressly endorsed the interpretation of s. 273.1(1) set out in Hutchinson.

[283]                     In sum, the Crown has failed to demonstrate any foundational erosion that would warrant departing from Hutchinson.

(4)         Even if Hutchinson Could Be Overturned, This Court Should Exercise Its Discretion to Uphold It

[284]                     In the alternative, even if Hutchinson were unworkable or if its precedential foundation had eroded, there are at least two compelling reasons to uphold it.

[285]                     First, overturning Hutchinson would raise concerns regarding the retrospective expansion of criminal liability. In Hutchinson, this Court explicitly excluded contraceptive use from the scope of consent contemplated in s. 273.1(1). However, our colleague now purports to re-interpret s. 273.1(1) to include condom use in the consent analysis in certain circumstances, thus broadening the ambit of criminal liability for sexual assault beyond that set out in Hutchinson. As we explained above, and as Dickson C.J. (dissenting, but not on this point) underscored in Bernard, an expansion of criminal liability weighs heavily against overturning precedent. Even if it were open to our colleague to overturn Hutchinson (which it is not), the radical approach to the consent analysis she proposes would give us pause. More to the point, and as the Hutchinson majority recognized, while s. 273.1 signals Parliament’s emphasis on positive affirmation of consent, there is “no suggestion that Parliament intended to expand the notion of ‘sexual activity’ by including not only the sexual act for which consent is required, but also potentially infinite collateral conditions, such as the state of the condom” (para. 27 (emphasis added)). Yet this is precisely what our colleague’s re-interpretation of s. 273.1(1) would do, contrary to Parliament’s intent as ascertained by this Court in Hutchinson.

[286]                     Second, overturning Hutchinson may lead to unforeseeable consequences. Suddenly re-orienting the law to expand the scope of consent would be a major legal change engaging potentially wide-reaching policy issues. Where, as here, there is no constitutional infirmity with the impugned provision, it is not for the Court “to second‑guess the wisdom of policy choices made by our legislators” (Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.), 1990 CanLII 105 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1123, at p. 1199). Parliament may see fit to legislate a distinction between, for instance, the act of surreptitiously removing a condom to ejaculate inside one’s sexual partner, and the act of lying about having had a vasectomy to do the same. Our colleague would characterize the former as a consent violation, and the latter as fraud vitiating consent previously obtained. But, for all the foregoing reasons, the interpretation of s. 273.1(1) set out by the Hutchinson Court precludes her from doing so. Whether this distinction should form part of Canadian sexual assault law is a matter for Parliament — and not our colleague — to decide.

(5)         Conclusion on Horizontal Stare Decisis Applied to Hutchinson

[287]                     The seriousness of overturning a precedent of this Court cannot be overstated. We are not persuaded that any proper basis exists on which to overturn Hutchinson. Since it cannot be distinguished, Hutchinson must govern the case at bar. In the following section, we apply the two-step consent analysis mandated by Hutchinson to the facts of this appeal.

D.           Application of Hutchinson to This Appeal

[288]                     In our view, Bennett J.A. in the court below properly applied Hutchinson and the principles applicable on no-evidence motions. Like Bennett J.A., applying the two-step consent analysis mandated by the Hutchinson Court, we conclude that: (1) condom use cannot be analyzed under s. 273.1(1) as part of “the sexual activity in question”; and (2) there was some evidence that the complainant’s consent to unprotected sex may have been vitiated by fraud within the meaning of s. 265(3)(c).

(1)         The Two-Step Analysis of Consent Mandated by Hutchinson

[289]                     We are bound — as is our colleague — to apply the two-step analytical framework set out in Hutchinson to determine whether valid consent existed at the time of the impugned sexual activity between Mr. Kirkpatrick and the complainant.

[290]                     The first step is to determine whether the evidence establishes that there was no “voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question” under s. 273.1(1). If the complainant voluntarily agreed to the sexual activity within the meaning of s. 273.1 (or a reasonable doubt was raised), the court should then turn to the second step.

[291]                     The second step is to consider whether any of the enumerated circumstances in ss. 265(3) or 273.1(2) are present, such that the complainant’s voluntary agreement to the sexual activity in question did not constitute consent in law. Section 265(3) defines circumstances, including fraud at subs. (c), under which the law recognizes the complainant did not consent, notwithstanding their apparent agreement to participate in sexual activity (Hutchinson, at para. 55; Ewanchuk, at para. 36).

[292]                     At this juncture, it is critical to recall the low threshold on a no‑evidence motion. It is not the trial judge’s role at this preliminary stage to test the quality or reliability of the evidence, measure the credibility of the witnesses, draw inferences from facts, or weigh the evidence to determine if he or she would be satisfied of the guilt of the accused. The task is simply to determine whether, if the Crown’s evidence is believed, it would be reasonable for a trier of fact to infer guilt (S. N. Lederman, A. W. Bryant and M. K. Fuerst, Sopinka, Lederman & Bryant: The Law of Evidence in Canada (5th ed. 2018), at §5.27; R. v. Arcuri, 2001 SCC 54, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828, at para. 30). It is this generous threshold by which we must assess the evidence that was before the trial judge in the present case.

[293]                     We will now address each step of the Hutchinson framework in turn, applying the requisite evidentiary threshold on a no-evidence motion.

(a)         Step One: Consent to the Sexual Activity in Question

[294]                     We have already explained, at length, that Hutchinson categorically eliminates condom use from the definition of “the sexual activity in question” under s. 273.1(1). Hutchinson thus precludes us from assessing Mr. Kirkpatrick’s admitted failure to wear a condom in determining whether there was voluntary agreement to the sexual activity in question. We need say no more on this point.

[295]                     The sole question at this stage is whether there is any evidence that the complainant consented to the impugned sexual intercourse with Mr. Kirkpatrick. At trial, the complainant’s evidence was that she consented to all physical sex acts in which the parties engaged on the night in question. Accordingly, we agree with the trial judge and Bennett J.A. of the Court of Appeal that there is some evidence of consent to “the sexual activity in question” at the first step of the Hutchinson framework under s. 273.1.

[296]                     Therefore, the analysis for the no-evidence motion can then proceed to whether there is any evidence of fraud on behalf of Mr. Kirkpatrick that may have vitiated the complainant’s apparent consent.

(b)         Step Two: Fraud Vitiating Consent

[297]                     Hutchinson confirmed that fraud capable of vitiating consent to sexual activity has two elements: (1) dishonesty by the accused; and (2) deprivation or a risk of deprivation in the form of serious bodily harm to the complainant flowing from the accused’s dishonesty (para. 67; see also Mabior, at para. 104).

[298]                     As we will explain, we agree with Bennett J.A. that there was at least “some evidence” before the trial judge on both elements, such that the trial judge erred in granting Mr. Kirkpatrick’s no‑evidence motion.

(i)            Dishonesty

[299]                     Dishonesty under s. 265(3)(c) “can include non-disclosure of important facts” (Cuerrier, at para. 116). In Mabior, this Court clarified that “a clear misrepresentation or a lie in response to a clear question” is not necessary to establish dishonesty (para. 61). Rather, a failure to disclose information will amount to dishonesty where the complainant would not have consented had they known the undisclosed information, such as the fact that the accused is HIV‑positive (para. 104). Prior conversations between sexual partners and the circumstances surrounding their sexual encounter may be relevant to determining whether one party’s alleged failure to disclose amounts to dishonesty (para. 64).

[300]                     We conclude that Mr. Kirkpatrick’s failure to disclose he was not wearing a condom constituted at least “some evidence” of dishonesty sufficient to preclude a directed acquittal. We agree with Bennett J.A. that the trial judge misapplied Mabior by looking for specific deception on Mr. Kirkpatrick’s part prior to the second round of sexual intercourse (C.A. reasons, at para. 117). The complainant testified that she had repeatedly communicated to Mr. Kirkpatrick that condom use was a condition of her consent. The first time they had sex, the complainant testified that she “asked him if he had any condoms with him and if he didn’t have any condoms, it was okay because I have brought condoms with me” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 20). Afterwards, the complainant testified that she asked the appellant “if he used a condom and he said that he did and I asked to see it” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 21). If we accept — as we must at this preliminary stage — the complainant’s evidence, Mr. Kirkpatrick would have been well aware that her consent was conditional on condom use. Nevertheless, when they had sex for the second time, mere hours later, Mr. Kirkpatrick failed to disclose that he was not wearing a condom. In our view, in the context of a no-evidence motion, this constitutes some evidence of dishonesty by omission, as contemplated in Mabior.

[301]                     We would reject Mr. Kirkpatrick’s submission that this reasoning imposes a positive duty to disclose condom use in all situations where a partner has advised of its importance. To the contrary, it is rooted firmly in the factual record. On the complainant’s evidence, days before their sexual encounter she told Mr. Kirkpatrick she would never consent to sexual intercourse without a condom. According to the complainant, she reminded Mr. Kirkpatrick about this condition twice: once before the first round of intercourse, when she asked if he was wearing a condom, and once again afterwards, when she asked to see the condom. The complainant further testified that, prior to the second round of intercourse, Mr. Kirkpatrick turned away from her in the direction of the bedside table from which he had obtained a condom the first time. In our view, the foregoing provides at least some evidence that the complainant would not have consented had Mr. Kirkpatrick told her he was not wearing a condom, despite her clear stipulation that he wear one, before penetrating her on the second occasion. Despite this conclusion, we wish to be clear. We do not mean to suggest that non‑disclosure of one’s failure to wear a condom will always be criminal. Our conclusion is intertwined with the particular facts of this case.

[302]                     Further, it must be recalled that no conclusive factual findings are made on a no-evidence motion. At re-trial, the Crown will need to establish not only the actus reus of fraud vitiating consent under s. 265(3)(c), but that Mr. Kirkpatrick had the requisite mens rea for fraud. This will require the Crown to prove that Mr. Kirkpatrick subjectively knew that he was behaving dishonestly, and that his dishonesty would lead to a deprivation, or risk of deprivation, to the complainant (Cuerrier, at para. 114). Whether the Crown succeeds in doing so is a matter for the trial judge.

(ii)         Deprivation

[303]                     In our view, Bennett J.A. was correct to find some evidence of a risk of deprivation to the complainant in this case, namely, a risk of pregnancy (C.A. reasons, at para. 119).

[304]                     In Hutchinson, at paras. 70‑71, the majority held that “[d]epriving a woman of the choice whether to become pregnant or increasing the risk of pregnancy” may constitute a sufficiently serious deprivation for the purposes of fraud vitiating consent under s. 265(3)(c). The complainant in this case testified that Mr. Kirkpatrick ejaculated inside her vagina. Upon realizing that he had not been wearing a condom, the complainant expressed concern to him about becoming pregnant. There was no evidence before the trial judge to suggest that the complainant was on birth control or otherwise incapable of becoming pregnant. Mr. Kirkpatrick fairly concedes that it is “undisputed that risk of pregnancy meets the second element of fraud” (A.F., at para. 52). We see no basis on which to interfere with Bennett J.A.’s conclusion on this point. Accordingly, applying the proper standard of proof applicable on a no-evidence motion, there was at least some evidence of a risk of deprivation through the risk of pregnancy.

[305]                     In light of the foregoing, there is no need to discuss Bennett J.A.’s finding, at para. 119, that the side effects of HIV prophylactic treatment allegedly pursued by the complainant may constitute evidence of deprivation. We leave this issue for another day, with the benefit of a full evidentiary record and comprehensive argument on this important issue.

(2)         Conclusion on the Two-Step Consent Framework

[306]                     In sum, at the first step of the Hutchinson framework, there is some evidence that the complainant voluntarily agreed to the sexual activity in question under s. 273.1(1).

[307]                     However, at the second step, there is also some evidence that the complainant’s apparent consent may have been vitiated by fraud. In our view, Bennett J.A.’s conclusion that the trial judge misapplied the Mabior test for dishonesty is sound. On the low threshold of a no-evidence motion, there was at least some evidence of dishonesty by omission and risk of deprivation through the risk of pregnancy.

[308]                     Accordingly, a new trial is required to determine whether the complainant’s consent was in fact vitiated through fraud and, consequently, whether Mr. Kirkpatrick committed sexual assault within the meaning of s. 265(3)(c).

[309]                     We would add a final point on the subject of re‑trial. We agree with our colleague that one is warranted, in light of the legal error we have identified in the trial judge’s fraud analysis. However, given the pending re-trial, we believe it is inappropriate for this Court to draw inferences in favour of either party from the evidence at the first trial. We take particular issue with our colleague’s inference, at para. 58, that Mr. Kirkpatrick engaged in “stealthing”, a term never put to the complainant or discussed at trial. We affirm that it is not our role at this preliminary stage to make any finding relevant to Mr. Kirkpatrick’s culpability for the offence alleged, or to draw any inference that may impinge upon the presumption of his innocence at re‑trial.

III.         Disposition

[310]                     For all the foregoing reasons, we would dismiss the appeal. In the result, we affirm the Court of Appeal’s order setting aside the acquittal and ordering a new trial.

 

                    Appeal dismissed.
                    
                    
2022 SCC 34

APPEAL from a judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal (Saunders, Goepel and DeWitt‑Van Oosten JJ.A.), 2021 BCCA 41, 400 C.C.C. (3d) 131, [2021] B.C.J. No. 151 (QL), 2021 CarswellBC 232 (WL), setting aside the conviction of the accused for second degree murder and ordering a new trial. Appeal allowed, Karakatsanis and Brown JJ. dissenting.

                    Mary T. Ainslie, K.C., and Liliane Y. Bantourakis, for the appellant.

                    Christopher Nowlin, Thomas Arbogast, K.C., and Katherine Kirkpatrick, for the respondent.

 

                  The judgment of Wagner C.J. and Moldaver, Côté, Rowe, Martin, Kasirer and Jamal JJ. was delivered by

 

                    Rowe J. —

[1]                              This appeal concerns the admissibility of hearsay evidence, being testimony of an overheard phone conversation that included an admission of criminal responsibility. Central to these reasons is the view that the admissibility of such evidence is governed by foundational legal principles, rather than some unique rule. Thus, in deciding this case I will consider relevance, hearsay and the discretionary weighing of probative value against prejudicial effect. It will be necessary, as well, to apply this Court’s decision in R. v. Ferris, 1994 CanLII 31 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 756.

[2]                              In deciding this appeal, I will answer three questions. First, whether what the witness overheard had meaning, such that it was relevant to an issue at trial. Second, whether what the witness overheard was admissible under an exception to the general exclusionary rule against hearsay. Third, whether the trial judge appropriately refused to exclude the evidence on the basis that the probative value outweighed the prejudicial effect. I answer each question in the affirmative. What the witness overheard the accused say on the phone was capable of non-speculative meaning such that it was relevant; it was admissible under the “party admission” exception to hearsay; and there is no basis to disturb the trial judge’s decision to admit the evidence.

[3]                              The police charged the respondent, William Victor Schneider (“accused”), with second degree murder and interfering with a dead body contrary to ss. 235(1) and 182(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. At trial, the Crown sought to adduce hearsay evidence from the accused’s brother, Warren Schneider Jr. (“brother”), who overheard the accused speaking on the phone with his wife. The brother testified that, while he could not recall the precise words the accused said, during that call the accused admitted to killing the victim. This is the evidence at issue. At the close of the Crown’s case, the accused pleaded guilty to interfering with the body. Thus, this appeal deals only with the murder charge.

[4]                              The trial judge admitted the brother’s testimony as to the overheard conversation. The jury convicted the accused of second degree murder. The accused appealed, arguing the trial judge erred, inter alia, by admitting the brother’s testimony as to the overheard conversation. A majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction and ordered a new trial, holding that the at-issue testimony was inadmissible. The dissenting judge would have dismissed the appeal as she would have upheld the trial judge’s admission of the evidence and affirmed the conviction.

[5]                              The judges of the Court of Appeal all agreed that R. v. Ferris (1994), 1994 ABCA 20 (CanLII), 149 A.R. 1 (C.A.), as affirmed by this Court, governed whether the brother’s testimony was admissible. All were of the view that the evidence was admissible if it was capable of meaning and, thus, relevant to an issue at trial. However, the judges disagreed as to what other trial evidence could inform the analysis of whether the evidence had meaning and was, thus, relevant. The majority drew a tight contextual circle around the evidence that could inform meaning. In doing so, the majority held that only the “micro” context, i.e. the words before and after the evidence at issue, was pertinent to meaning. The dissent saw all the evidence as capable of informing the meaning of what the brother overheard.

[6]                              The Crown asks this Court to allow the appeal and restore the conviction. I would do so. The trial judge did not err in admitting this part of the brother’s evidence. There is no basis in law to differentiate between “micro” and “macro” context when determining whether evidence is capable of meaning and, therefore, relevant. All the evidence is capable of informing a judge’s analysis of this question.

[7]                              In response to the Crown’s as of right appeal, the accused raised an additional issue. He argues that the trial judge erred in dealing with a mid-deliberation question from the jury. On this point, I am in substantial agreement with the unanimous Court of Appeal. The jury’s question was not ambiguous and the trial judge did not err in answering it.

I.               Facts

[8]                             The victim, Ms. Natsumi Kogawa, was reported missing on 12 September 2016. Police issued a news release on 27 September 2016 with a picture showing Ms. Kogawa with an unidentified male at a mall. Police asked for the public’s assistance identifying that man. Police then received a tip from the accused’s brother as to the whereabouts of Ms. Kogawa’s body. That tip led to police recovering Ms. Kogawa’s body, two weeks after she was reported missing, in a suitcase hidden in Vancouver’s West End. After investigation, police arrested the accused and charged him with second degree murder and interfering with Ms. Kogawa’s body after death.

[9]                             Between the police news release and his tip to police, the brother had several critical conversations with the accused. I describe these below. As the accused did not testify, the descriptions come entirely from the brother’s testimony.

A.           27 September 2016

[10]                        On 27 September 2016, the brother’s daughter brought the police news release to his attention. She asked if the unidentified man was the accused (her uncle). The brother said yes. He then called the accused to tell him about the police news release. The accused did not respond and hung up the phone.

[11]                          The brother went to where the accused was staying and the two went for a walk. During this walk, the accused described his relationship with Ms. Kogawa. He said that he had gone on three dates with her. He told his brother that on the third date they took “medication”. The brother testified that the accused appeared “[r]emorsefully sad” during this conversation and that the accused told him “it’s true” (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 113-14). The trial judge excluded the brother’s evidence as to what he thought the accused meant by this statement. The brother told the accused that they should speak again in the morning.

B.            28 September 2016

[12]                        The next morning, the accused told the brother that he intended to purchase heroin and use the drug to die by suicide. The accused asked the brother to be with him; the brother agreed. They both purchased alcohol and the accused purchased heroin. Together, they went to a park.

[13]                        After arriving at the park, and before taking heroin, the accused told the brother the location of Ms. Kogawa’s body. The brother was to inform the police of the body’s location after the accused died by suicide. The accused then injected himself with heroin. However, he did not die.

[14]                          After this suicide attempt, the accused asked the brother for his cellphone. The accused called his wife, a non-compellable witness. This call is at the center of this appeal. Although the brother was about 10 feet away and “not actively trying to listen” (C.A. reasons, 2021 BCCA 41, 400 C.C.C. (3d) 131, at para. 42), he overheard portions of the accused’s conversation. What the brother can testify to regarding what he overheard is the principal issue in this appeal.

II.            Testimony at Issue

A.           The Brother’s Voir Dire Testimony

[15]                        The trial judge held a voir dire regarding the admissibility of the brother’s testimony as to what he overheard the accused say to his wife.

[16]                          In the voir dire examination-in-chief, the brother testified that the accused began the call by saying “[d]id you see the news of the missing Japanese woman, student?” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 135). He also testified that the accused later said, “I did it” and “I killed her” (ibid.).

[17]                          In the voir dire cross-examination, defence counsel confronted the brother with his preliminary inquiry testimony in which he had testified that he “believe[d]” the accused said “I did it” or “I killed her” (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 141 and 147). After seeing the preliminary inquiry transcript, the brother said that “word-for-word” he could not remember what the accused said, but that the statements made were “along those lines” (pp. 138-45).

[18]                        The trial judge ruled the testimony was admissible.

B.            The Brother’s Trial Testimony

[19]                          During examination-in-chief, the brother stated that the accused, at the beginning of the phone conversation, said “[d]id you hear the news about the missing Japanese student?” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 170). He testified he did not know the exact words the accused said after, but thought that “[n]ear halfway through the conversation” the accused said that “he did it, he killed her” (ibid.). Although the brother heard only one side of the conversation, the gist of what he overheard was that the accused was taking responsibility for Ms. Kogawa’s death. The brother testified that the conversation “wasn’t . . . mild” or “loving” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 171).

[20]                        During cross-examination, the brother acknowledged that he did not recall the exact words that the accused used. Further, even if he was correct in remembering that the accused said “I did it” or “I killed her”, he was unaware what these phrases were said in response to. The brother could not be sure if the phrases were said in response to a question or if they related to Ms. Kogawa’s disappearance. The brother testified he was not trying to listen to the conversation, that he was under significant stress at the time, and that he had consumed alcohol.

III.         Decisions in Issue

A.           The Voir Dire Ruling, 2018 BCSC 2546

[21]                          The trial judge took the view that admissibility of the brother’s evidence hinged on whether: (1) there was “some evidence” (para. 19, reproduced in A.R., vol. I, at p. 5) that the jury could use to determine the meaning of the words the brother overheard, such that the words were relevant and (2) the probative value of the evidence outweighed the prejudicial effect.

[22]                        That the brother was unable to recall the exact words did not make his testimony inadmissible. He testified that the accused said “I killed her” or “I did it” and that he understood the “gist” of the conversation (paras. 16-17). There was sufficient context for the jury to give meaning to the words. The probative value of the evidence outweighed any prejudicial effect; as well, a “strong caution to the jury” could ameliorate any issues associated with the evidence (para. 21). On this basis, the trial judge admitted the evidence.

B.            Answer to the Jury’s Mid-Deliberation Question and Conviction

[23]                          During deliberation, the jury sent a handwritten note to the court setting out the following question (see the reproduction in the appendix to these reasons):

Could you please expand on the definition of bodily harm in Q3 (intent required for murder) versus bodily harm as described in para 109./111 for manslaughter.

 

*        Bodily Harm

Any hurt or injury . . . 

Interfers [sic] health . . . 

More than just brief/minor.

 

*        Concept of Bodily Harm

That the accused knows is “likely” to cause death and reckless . . . 

[Emphasis in original.]

 

(A.R., vol. IV, at p. 215; see also C.A. reasons, at para. 115.)

[24]                        The references to “Q3” and “para 109./111” are to the following passages in the jury instructions:

[109] The criminal fault in manslaughter is the commission of the unlawful act which is objectively dangerous in the sense that a reasonable person, in the same circumstances as the accused, would recognize that the unlawful act would subject another person to the risk of bodily harm. “Bodily harm” is any hurt or injury that interferes with a person’s health or comfort and is more than just brief or of a minor nature.

 

[110] In the offence of murder there is in addition to the unlawful act, the ingredient of either an intention to cause death or an intention to cause bodily harm that the accused knows is likely to cause death and is reckless as to whether death ensues. These are the legal differences between the offences of second degree murder and manslaughter.

 

[111] Therefore, what distinguishes murder from manslaughter is the mental state, or what we describe in criminal law as the intent of the person causing the death.

 

 

[Q3: Did Mr. Schneider Have the Intent Required for Murder?]

 

[132] To prove that Mr. Schneider had the intent required for murder, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt one of two things, either:

 

1.      that Mr. Schneider meant to cause Ms. Kogawa’s death; or

 

2.   that Mr. Schneider meant to cause Ms. Kogawa bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause her death and was reckless whether death ensued or not.

 

[133] In other words, you must decide whether the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt either that Mr. Schneider meant to kill Ms. Kogawa, or that Mr. Schneider meant to cause Ms. Kogawa bodily harm that he knew was so dangerous and serious it was likely to kill Ms. Kogawa and proceeded despite his knowledge of that risk. [Emphasis deleted.]

 

(See C.A. reasons, at paras. 116-17.)

[25]                          The trial judge conferred with counsel regarding the jury’s question. She asked if they thought that she should provide the jury with an expanded definition of intent. Crown counsel replied that the jury “seem[ed] to be caught up that with bodily harm there must be some injury or bruising or something of that nature” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 327). Defence counsel recommended that the judge provide to the jury the definition of “bodily harm” set out in s. 2 of the Criminal Code. The judge agreed with this and indicated that initially she had misread the jury’s question. Although Crown counsel went on to suggest an expanded definition of intent, defence counsel was firm that this was not what the jury was asking about. The trial judge decided that she would “wait until [they] get there” on intent (A.R., vol. III, at p. 331). She called in the jury and twice read the definition of “bodily harm” from s. 2 of the Criminal Code. The jury asked no further questions and convicted the accused of second degree murder.

C.            British Columbia Court of Appeal, 2021 BCCA 41, 400 C.C.C. (3d) 131

[26]                        The accused appealed his conviction on three grounds. Two are relevant to the appeal before this Court. He asked the Court of Appeal to consider if the trial judge erred:

(1) by admitting the brother’s testimony regarding the overheard telephone conversation (“Admissibility Issue”); and

(2) in responding to the question from the jury (“Jury Question Issue”).

[27]                        The Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed the Jury Question Issue but divided on the Admissibility Issue. The majority held that the brother’s testimony as to the overheard telephone conversation was inadmissible; DeWitt-Van Oosten J.A., in dissent, held that the trial judge did not err in admitting this testimony.

(1)         The Admissibility Issue

[28]                          The Court of Appeal judges agreed that the brother’s testimony was admissible if: (1) it was relevant; and (2) the probative value outweighed the prejudicial effect. However, the majority and dissent differed as to the context that a trial judge could use to decide whether the party admission was capable of meaning and, therefore, relevant. The majority held there are two facets to context: “micro” and “macro” (para. 203). Only the micro context, i.e. the words said before and after the overheard admission, were pertinent in determining whether the admission had meaning. As the brother could not recall “what was said before or after the overheard words[,] no properly instructed jury could conclude that the overheard fragment was an admission” (paras. 205-6). The testimony was not relevant and, accordingly, should not have been admitted.

[29]                          Justice DeWitt-Van Oosten, in dissent, would have held that trial judges can consider all the evidence when determining if the words had meaning and, thus, are relevant. In this case, there was significant evidence (beyond the “micro” context) to inform the meaning of the words the brother overheard. The brother had several conversations with the accused leading up to the phone call; the accused responded to the brother’s questions about the news release identifying a missing woman by saying “it’s true”; the accused had informed the brother of the location of Ms. Kogawa’s body; the accused displayed a remorseful demeanour during interactions that he had with the brother leading up to the phone call. The words the brother overheard “formed part of an ongoing interaction and dialogue” (para. 89). From the entirety of the evidence, a properly instructed jury would be able to give meaning to the words overheard in a manner that was not speculative. As such, the brother’s testimony was relevant.

[30]                        Considering the next step of admissibility, DeWitt-Van Oosten J.A. held the trial judge’s weighing of probative value against prejudicial effect was entitled to deference. Further, any prejudice that might have arisen had been limited by appropriate jury instructions explaining the proper use of the party admission. In the result, DeWitt-Van Oosten J.A. would have dismissed this ground of appeal.

(2)         The Jury Question Issue

[31]                        The accused argued that the trial judge erred in two ways: first, by failing to ask the jury for clarification of the question, as it was ambiguous; and, second, by failing to answer it correctly. The panel unanimously dismissed this ground of appeal. The question was not ambiguous and there was no validity to the accused’s suggestion that the definition of bodily harm was different for manslaughter than for murder. Principles of statutory interpretation demand that the same definition for bodily harm apply to both offences. The difference between the two offences is not in the degree of bodily harm an accused inflicts, but rather in the intent that accompanies the act. The panel concluded there was “no reasonable possibility of the jury having been misled and convicting the [accused] of second degree murder based on a diminished form of intent” (para. 148).

IV.         Issues on Appeal

[32]                          The Crown appealed the Court of Appeal’s decision on the Admissibility Issue as of right. The accused raised the Jury Question Issue as an alternative basis on which this Court could uphold the order from the Court of Appeal.

V.           Analysis

[33]                        I address this appeal in two parts. First, I address the Admissibility Issue. I conclude that the trial judge did not err in admitting the brother’s testimony. Second, I address the Jury Question Issue. On this issue I am in substantial agreement with the unanimous reasons of the Court of Appeal. Like them, I conclude that the jury’s question was not ambiguous and that the trial judge did not err in answering it. In the result, I would allow the Crown’s appeal, set aside the Court of Appeal decision and restore the accused’s conviction for second degree murder.

A.           Admissibility Issue

[34]                          The Court of Appeal focused on the fact that the evidence is a party admission. While being mindful of this, my analysis situates the Admissibility Issue in the broader context of the law of evidence, rather than treating it as a unique or niche issue.

[35]                          I proceed first by describing what I consider to be settled law as to the general procedure for determining admissibility of evidence at a criminal trial, including party admissions. I then apply the foregoing to the brother’s testimony, concluding that the trial judge did not err in admitting the evidence.

(1)         Legal Framework for Admissibility of Evidence at a Criminal Trial

[36]                          Evidence that is relevant to an issue at trial is admissible, as long as it is not subject to an exclusionary rule and the trial judge does not exercise their discretion to exclude it (R. v. Khelawon, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, at para. 2; D. M. Paciocco, P. Paciocco and L. Stuesser, The Law of Evidence (8th ed. 2020), at p. 32; S. N. Lederman, M. K. Fuerst and H. C. Stewart, Sopinka, Lederman & Bryant: The Law of Evidence in Canada (6th ed. 2022), at ¶2.48; M. Vauclair and T. Desjardins, in collaboration with P. Lachance, Traité général de preuve et de procédure pénales 2022 (29th ed. 2022), at pp. 905-6). This is the three-part test for admission of all evidence. Judges must consider: (a) whether the evidence is relevant; (b) whether it is subject to an exclusionary rule; and (c) whether to exercise their discretion to exclude the evidence.

[37]                          When questions arise as to the admissibility of evidence, a voir dire is often needed. That said, this Court has noted in obiter that a voir dire may not be necessary for party admission evidence (R. v. S.G.T., 2010 SCC 20, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 688, at para. 20). Whether a voir dire is needed for such evidence is to be determined in the circumstances of each case.

(a)           Determine Whether the Evidence Is Relevant to an Issue at Trial

[38]                          The first step in determining admissibility is considering whether the evidence is relevant. At this stage, this is often referred to as “logical relevance”. However, I will use the word “relevance” (rather than “logical relevance”) in this decision.

[39]                          To determine relevance, a judge must ask whether the evidence tends to increase or decrease the probability of a fact at issue (R. v. Arp, 1998 CanLII 769 (SCC), [1998] 3 S.C.R. 339, at para. 38). Beyond this, there is no “legal test” for relevance (Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at p. 35). Judges, acting in their gatekeeping role, are to evaluate relevance “as a matter of logic and human experience” (R. v. White, 2011 SCC 13, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 433, at para. 44). When doing so, they should take care not to usurp the role of the finder of fact, although this evaluation will necessitate some weighing of the evidence, which is typically reserved for the jury (Vauclair and Desjardins, at p. 687, citing R. v. Hart, 2014 SCC 52, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 544, at paras. 95 and 98). The evidence does not need to “firmly establish . . . the truth or falsity of a fact in issue” (Arp, at para. 38), although the evidence may be too speculative or equivocal to be relevant (White, at para. 44). The threshold for relevance is low and judges can admit evidence that has modest probative value (Arp, at para. 38; R. v. Grant, 2015 SCC 9, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 475, at para. 18). A judge’s consideration of relevance “does not involve considerations of sufficiency of probative value” and “admissibility . . . must not be confused with weight” (R. v. Corbett, 1988 CanLII 80 (SCC), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, at p. 715 , per La Forest J., dissenting, but not on this point, quoting Morris v. The Queen, 1983 CanLII 28 (SCC), [1983] 2 S.C.R. 190, at p. 192). Concepts like ultimate reliability, believability, and probative weight have no place when deciding relevance. Whether evidence is relevant is a question of law, reviewable on the standard of correctness (R. v. Mohan, 1994 CanLII 80 (SCC), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9, at pp. 20-21).

[40]                          This leads to the issue that divided the court below: what evidentiary context can a trial judge use to determine whether the evidence is capable of meaning, such that it could be relevant? Justice Charron addressed this in R. v. Blackman, 2008 SCC 37, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 298, at para. 30:

     Relevance can only be fully assessed in the context of the other evidence at trial. However, as a threshold for admissibility, the assessment of relevance is an ongoing and dynamic process that cannot wait for the conclusion of the trial for resolution. Depending on the stage of the trial, the “context” within which an item of evidence is assessed for relevance may well be embryonic. Often, for pragmatic reasons, relevance must be determined on the basis of the submissions of counsel. The reality that establishing threshold relevance cannot be an exacting standard is explained by Professors D. M. Paciocco and L. Stuesser in The Law of Evidence (4th ed. 2005), at p. 29, and, as the authors point out, is well captured in the following statement of Cory J. in R. v. Arp, 1998 CanLII 769 (SCC), [1998] 3 S.C.R. 339, at para. 38:

 

To be logically relevant, an item of evidence does not have to firmly establish, on any standard, the truth or falsity of a fact in issue. The evidence must simply tend to “increase or diminish the probability of the existence of a fact in issue”. [Emphasis deleted.]

[41]                          As Charron J. explained, trial judges can consider relevance having regard to evidence that parties have adduced, as well as evidence that a party indicates that they intend to adduce. The judge can admit the evidence at issue conditional on counsel’s undertaking as to evidence to be adduced (Lederman, Fuerst and Stewart, at ¶2.72). Given the connection between meaning and relevance, Charron J.’s writing in Blackman logically extends to evidence that can inform meaning.

[42]                          This general proposition applies to party admissions. There is no basis to treat party admissions differently in the determination of relevance. At this stage in the analysis, trial judges do not need to have classified the evidence as a party admission. In drawing a tight circle around what other evidence can be taken into account in determining the relevance of party admissions (the “micro” versus “macro” distinction), the Court of Appeal majority erred in law.

[43]                          In making this point, I am mindful that evidence does not need to be unequivocal to be relevant. In R. v. Evans, 1993 CanLII 86 (SCC), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 653, Sopinka J. underlined that while questions of admissibility are for the trial judge, whether a statement was made and whether it is true are questions for the trier of fact (pp. 664-66; see also Vauclair and Desjardins, at pp. 865-66). Party admissions, like other evidence, are not rendered inadmissible because the witness is equivocal in their testimony. Witnesses often have imperfect recollection and express uncertainty in their testimony. To the extent that these are matters related to admissibility (rather than the weight that the trier of fact gives to the evidence), they are properly to be considered by the trial judge when balancing probative value against prejudicial effect. Thus, the fact that a witness cannot recall the exact words used does not mean that such evidence has no relevance.

[44]                          Of course, parties are not permitted to “bootstrap” their argument on the admissibility of a party admission to any and all evidence. The party seeking to admit the proposed evidence should limit their submissions to the evidentiary context that is relevant to determining the meaning of the statement at issue. In a criminal case, the Crown may not argue that any evidence pointing towards the accused’s guilt provides relevant context. The focus should remain on whether the jury can give meaning to the witness’s testimony in a manner that is non-speculative, not the overall strength of the Crown’s case.

[45]                          In summary, judges determine relevance by asking whether, in light of all the other evidence, the at-issue evidence logically tends to make a fact in issue more or less likely. This standard applies to all evidence in criminal trials.

(b)         Determine Whether the Evidence Is Subject to an Exclusionary Rule

[46]                          Evidence that is relevant is ordinarily admissible, subject to various exclusionary rules. Hearsay evidence, which is at issue in this appeal, is subject to an exclusionary rule and various exceptions.

[47]                          Hearsay evidence has three components: (1) a statement (or action) made outside of court by a declarant; (2) which a party seeks to adduce in court for the truth of its content; (3) without the ability of the other party to contemporaneously cross‑examine the declarant (Khelawon, at para. 35; Evans, at pp. 661-62; see also R. v. Smith, 1992 CanLII 79 (SCC), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915, at p. 924).

[48]                          Historically, the common law excluded hearsay evidence (Smith, at pp. 924-25; R. v. Starr, 2000 SCC 40, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, at para. 153; R. v. Mapara, 2005 SCC 23, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 358, at para. 13). Courts premised this exclusion on two primary concerns. First, hearsay evidence may be unreliable and does not afford parties the ability to test reliability by cross-examination (Khelawon, at para. 2; Mapara, at para. 14). Second, direct evidence is preferable and, thus, hearsay evidence may not be the best available (Mapara, at para. 14). Accordingly, as a general proposition, hearsay evidence was excluded as a safeguard against inaccurate fact finding.

[49]                          However, excluding hearsay in some circumstances impeded rather than assisted accurate fact finding (Khelawon, at para. 2; Mapara, at para. 14). Over time, courts created exceptions to the general exclusionary bar against hearsay (Mapara, at para. 14). Often referred to as pigeonholes, such exceptions developed where hearsay evidence arose in circumstances that lessened concerns of reliability or where hearsay evidence was the best available. These exceptions “became rigid” and formalism abounded (Mapara, at para. 14; Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at p. 151). The law of hearsay became a complex array of categories each defined by narrow rules, on occasion giving rise to arbitrary results and detracting from accurate fact finding.

[50]                          In response, this Court developed a principled approach to hearsay in R. v. Khan, 1990 CanLII 77 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531 (Mapara, at para. 12). This was intended to arrest the development of circumstance-specific exceptions to hearsay — pigeonholes — and “introduce a measure of flexibility into the hearsay rule” to avoid arbitrary outcomes (Mapara, at para. 15). The principled approach provides for hearsay evidence to be admitted on the basis of two factors: necessity and reliability (Khan, at pp. 540-42; Starr, at para. 153; Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at pp. 152-54; Vauclair and Desjardins, at pp. 1078-89).

[51]                          In Mapara, the Court provided that recognized exceptions remain presumptively operative (para. 15, as confirmed in Khelawon, at para. 42; R. v. Baldree, 2013 SCC 35, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 520, at para. 34). However, litigants can challenge an exception on the basis that it is not “supported by indicia of necessity and reliability” (Mapara, at para. 15).

[52]                          The exception at issue in this case is a party admission. These include any “acts or words of a party offered as evidence against that party” (Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at p. 191 (emphasis added)). Although there has been debate as to whether party admissions are hearsay, I agree with the prevailing view set out by Charron J.: “. . . admissions from an accused fall within a well-recognized exception to the hearsay rule” (R. v. Couture, 2007 SCC 28, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 517, at para. 75; see also Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at p. 192).

[53]                          In criminal trials, a party admission will be evidence that the Crown adduces against an accused. As explained in Evans, the common law justifies allowing party admissions into evidence on the basis that a party cannot “complain of the unreliability of his or her own statements” (Evans, at p. 664). Unlike many other exceptions, justification for allowing party admissions does not relate to necessity or reliability (Vauclair and Desjardins, at p. 911). This is one aspect in which party admissions do not conform to general rules.

[54]                          This was confirmed by Charron J. in Khelawon: “Some of the traditional exceptions stand on a different footing, such as admissions from parties . . . . [T]he criteria for admissibility are not established in the same way” (para. 65). See also Hart, at para. 63; Couture, at para. 75; S.G.T., at para. 20; R. v. Bradshaw, 2017 SCC 35, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 865, at para. 82.

[55]                          Accordingly, party admissions are admissible without reference to necessity and reliability (R. v. Gordon Gray, 2021 QCCA 882, at paras. 27-28 (CanLII); R. v. Foreman (2002), 2002 CanLII 6305 (ON CA), 169 C.C.C. (3d) 489 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 37; R. v. Osmar, 2007 ONCA 50, 84 O.R. (3d) 321, at para. 53; R. v. Lo, 2020 ONCA 622, 152 O.R. (3d) 609, at para. 81). Thus, with the exception of the “rare cas[e]” where judges retain discretion to exclude any hearsay evidence on the basis that it is unreliable or unnecessary (Mapara, at para. 15), reliability and necessity are not relevant to the admissibility of a party admission.

[56]                          I digress briefly to underline a point. The party admission exception to the hearsay rule should not be confused with other exceptions that bear some similarity, for example a declaration against interest by a non-party. See Lo, at paras. 65-66; Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser at p. 192. Party admissions include “acts or words of a party offered as evidence against that party” (Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at p. 191 (emphasis added)). In contrast, declarations against interest are not adduced against the person who made the statement, as that person is not party to the litigation. Party admissions and declarations against interest have unique foundations. Courts began to permit the admission of declarations against interest on the presumption that “people do not readily make statements that admit facts contrary to their interests, unless those statements are true” (Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at p. 208). As stated earlier, courts allow party admissions on the basis that “what a party has previously stated can be admitted against the party in whose mouth it does not lie to complain of the unreliability of his or her own statements” (Evans, at p. 664). The unique foundation of each leads to different preconditions for admission.  

[57]                          In this appeal the party admission was something the accused said, that the witness overheard, and that the Crown tendered as evidence of the accused’s guilt (Evans, at p. 664; Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at pp. 191-92). However, party admissions can constitute more than words; the common law has held party admissions to include, inter alia, silence, actions, and demeanour (see, e.g., R. v. Scott, 2013 MBCA 7, 288 Man. R. (2d) 188; see also Lederman, Fuerst and Stewart, at ¶¶6.470-6.512; Vauclair and Desjardins, at p. 911). As noted by Professor I. Younger, a rule of thumb is that “[a]nything the other side ever said or did will be admissible so long as it has something to do with the case” (An Irreverent Introduction to Hearsay (1977), at p. 24, cited in Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at pp. 191-92). I do not seek to describe here the precise boundaries of party admissions, as that is not at issue.

[58]                          A trial judge’s determination that evidence is hearsay but falls within an exception from the general exclusionary rule is a question of law, reviewable on a standard of correctness.

(c)           Determine Whether to Use Judicial Discretion to Exclude the Evidence

[59]                          Finally, judges must determine whether they should exercise their discretion to exclude evidence by balancing probative value against prejudicial effect. Judges sitting with juries should consider the extent to which any prejudicial effect can be attenuated by appropriate instructions to the jury as to the use to which the evidence can properly be put. In addition, evidence can be excluded where there was a significant unfairness associated with obtaining it, such that it would render the accused’s trial unfair (Mohan; Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at pp. 47-48; Lederman, Fuerst and Stewart, at ¶¶2.75-2.77; Vauclair and Desjardins, at pp. 905-6). No such consideration arises in the circumstances of this case.

[60]                          Probative value relates to the degree of relevance to trial issues and the strength of inference that can be drawn from evidence (R. v. Handy, 2002 SCC 56, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908, at para. 26, citing R. v. Robertson, 1987 CanLII 61 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 918, at p. 943; Hart, at paras. 94-98). Prejudicial effect relates to the likelihood that a jury will misuse the evidence (Hart, at para. 106; Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at p. 52). Weighing probative value against prejudicial effect has been referred to as a “cost benefit analysis” (Mohan, at pp. 21-22; Hart, at para. 94; Vauclair and Desjardins, at pp. 905-6).

[61]                          As noted, the “cost” associated with the evidence (i.e. the prejudice) can be attenuated by appropriate jury instructions.  Proper instructions can effectively equip juries with an understanding of how to use evidence in a judicial manner (R. v. Khill, 2021 SCC 37, at para. 116; R. v. Griffin, 2009 SCC 28, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 42, at para. 69).

[62]                          A trial judge’s determination that the probative value of evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect is discretionary and should be reviewed with deference (R. v. Araya, 2015 SCC 11, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 581, at para. 31; R. v. Shearing, 2002 SCC 58, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 33, at para. 73). In addition, appellate courts are to review alleged errors in jury instructions “in the context of the entire charge and of the trial as a whole” (R. v. Jaw, 2009 SCC 42, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 26, at para. 32, as cited in Araya, at para. 39) so as to afford trial judges “some flexibility in crafting the language of jury instructions” (Araya, at para. 39). I would underscore the importance of trial judges providing clear analysis on the probative value and prejudicial effect of the evidence to facilitate appellate review. 

(2)         Application of the Legal Framework to the Circumstances of This Case

(a)         The Evidence Was Relevant

[63]                          The brother’s testimony regarding the overheard conversation was relevant. First, there was sufficient context for the jury to give meaning to the words that the brother overheard, such that the evidence overcomes the low threshold for (logical) relevance. Second, it is not fatal that the brother was uncertain as to the exact words that he heard the accused say. The equivocal nature of the brother’s testimony is a factor for consideration when weighing the probative value against the prejudicial effect. It also relates to ultimate reliability and believability; but those are for the trier of fact in weighing the evidence, rather than the judge in the relevance analysis.

[64]                          The trial judge needed to determine whether, on the basis of all the evidence, the jury could give meaning (in a way that was not speculative) to what the brother testified that he overheard. The context extended beyond the narrow scope that the majority of the Court of Appeal applied. Other evidence properly informed the brother’s testimony as to what he overheard.  In the days leading up to the phone call at issue, the accused and the brother had spoken about the victim. During these conversations, the accused admitted he had done “something bad”, told the brother that it was “true” (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 107, 111 and 113), and the brother said that the accused was “remorsefully sad. Glad to get it off his chest, per se” (p. 121). On the day of the phone call: the accused told the brother where the victim’s body was; the brother was with the accused when he attempted suicide; and the brother was with the accused in the time leading up to the phone call to his wife. Finally, the brother testified that the accused referred to the victim at the opening of the call. The brother was present, although standing approximately 10 feet away, for the entire call.

[65]                          I turn now to Ferris, the decision of this Court that the trial judge and Court of Appeal below agreed governed the admissibility of the evidence.

[66]                          Ferris concerned admissibility of hearsay evidence that the Crown sought to adduce as a party admission. Police arrested Mr. Ferris for murder and brought him to the station. Mr. Ferris asked to make a phone call. An officer placed the call, handed Mr. Ferris the phone, then walked towards his desk. As the officer walked away, he overheard Mr. Ferris say “I’ve been arrested” and then, sometime later, “I killed David” (Ferris (C.A.), at para. 7). The trial judge admitted the officer’s testimony as to what he heard Mr. Ferris say. Mr. Ferris was convicted by a jury of second degree murder.

[67]                          The Alberta Court of Appeal overturned the trial decision, holding that a properly instructed jury would be unable to ascribe meaning to the words the officer overheard. Words that were incapable of meaning could not be probative of any issue, and, therefore, were not relevant. Evidence that was not relevant was not admissible. The issue was not what weight to ascribe to the officer’s testimony, but whether the words he overheard had any meaning. The Court observed that “hearsay rules do not do away with the requirement of relevancy” (para. 32).

[68]                          The Court of Appeal explained that the phrase “I killed David” could have been an admission. It also could have been part of a reply to the question “what [do] the police think [you] did?” (para. 17). The words, “on their own”, did not “allow for the proper understanding and appreciation of the meaning of the statement” (para. 24). The officer’s testimony was inadmissible because the jury could not interpret the meaning of the words without “gross speculation” (para. 49).

[69]                          This Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision in Ferris in the result. In a short, oral judgment, Sopinka J. stated that even if the evidence had relevance, its meaning was “so speculative and its probative value so tenuous that the trial judge ought to have excluded it on the ground its prejudicial effect overbore its probative value” (p. 756). On a careful reading, what Sopinka J. said was not that the evidence was inadmissible based on relevance. This Court did not affirm the Court of Appeal’s relevance analysis or their application of the principled approach. Rather, Sopinka J. said that even if the testimony was relevant, it should have been excluded after balancing probative value against prejudicial effect.

[70]                          The trial evidence in Ferris was dissimilar to the evidence in this case. In Ferris, the accused and the police officer were strangers. There was nothing at all like the circumstances, sequence of events and conversations that led up to what in this case the brother overheard in the accused’s conversation with his wife.

[71]                          Again, we must bear in mind the difference between relevance and ultimate reliability. How well the brother could recall the words said by the accused relates to the latter, which is a question for the trier of fact. Few people would remember the exact words used in a recent conversation that they listened to intently. Nonetheless, many of us would be able to recall the gist of that conversation. The rules of evidence must respond to this reality. Probative value analysis and the weight given to the evidence by the trier of fact are sufficient mechanisms to address frailties of memory. These frailties do not also need to be addressed when determining relevance.

[72]                          Ferris is good law, but must be carefully read. Indeed, [translation] “[e]xclusion of a partial conversation is . . . not automatic and the analysis is above all a contextual one” (Vauclair and Desjardins, at p. 970). I would note its application in three decisions: R. v. Bennight, 2012 BCCA 190, 320 B.C.A.C. 195, R. v. Buttazzoni, 2019 ONCA 645, and R. v. Hummel, 2002 YKCA 6, 166 C.C.C. (3d) 30. See also R. v. Reierson, 2010 BCCA 381, 259 C.C.C. (3d) 32, at para. 40.

[73]                          Bennight is factually somewhat similar to this case. The British Columbia Court of Appeal allowed testimony from a corrections officer who could not recall the particular words that the offender said to her. The court held it was sufficient that “the witness could testify to both the ‘gist’ of the statement and the context in which it was made” (para. 92). That the officer was unable to remember the precise words said was not pertinent to the judge’s relevance analysis: incompleteness was a matter of weight for the jury. The accused argued before this Court that Bennight was different because the corrections officer heard both sides of the conversation. I find this to be a distinction without a difference. What matters is whether the evidence tends to increase or decrease the probability of a fact, not the particular circumstances in which the evidence arose.

[74]                          In Buttazzoni, the Ontario Court of Appeal determined that the trial judge properly admitted “recounted utterances [that] were described as ‘almost verbatim’”, and also properly admitted recounted utterances that were a “paraphrased synopsis” (para. 56). Issues with accuracy of recollection did not relate to relevance, but were an issue of weight for the trier of fact. Similarly to Bennight, the witness overheard both sides of the conversation. However, as noted, that is not a principled basis on which to distinguish these decisions from the circumstances in this appeal.

[75]                          The accused in Hummel argued on appeal that the trial judge improperly admitted testimony that suggested he said “I hear a woman’s voice calling my name” and “from a grave” (para. 8). The Yukon Court of Appeal held there was “ample context in which the words could be considered”, as the accused had uttered the words the morning after the victim was last seen alive and there was other evidence connecting him to the victim’s disappearance (para. 32). The jury could infer the accused was expressing remorse through these words.

[76]                          These decisions illustrate that Ferris should not be understood as standing for the proposition that incomplete recollection of a party admission leads to exclusion of such evidence or that it is only “micro context” that can inform meaning and, thus, relevance. In assessing (logical) relevance, what matters is whether the evidence tends to increase or decrease the probability of the existence of a fact at issue (Arp, at para. 38).

[77]                          Although he could not remember the exact words the accused said, the brother’s testimony was that he overheard a phone call in which the accused admitted to killing Ms. Kogawa. The brother’s recollection of the phone call, if believed by the jury, (to use the words from Arp) “tend[s] to ‘increase . . . the probability’” that the accused was responsible for the victim’s death. In light of other evidence, the brother’s evidence was capable of non-speculative meaning and relevant.

(b)         The Evidence Was Hearsay, but Subject to the Party Admissions Exception to the Exclusionary Rule

[78]                          The Crown adduced the brother’s evidence for the purpose of showing that the accused admitted to killing Ms. Kogawa. This evidence was hearsay and, thus, inadmissible under the general exclusionary rule. However, the brother’s evidence was that the accused had, by his words, admitted responsibility for Ms. Kogawa’s death. This evidence is something that a party said or did and relates to an issue at trial (see Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at pp. 191-92; Younger, at p. 24). As such, the evidence is a party admission and comes within a recognized exception to the general exclusionary rule.

(c)           In Light of the Comprehensive Jury Instructions, the Trial Judge Did Not Err by Admitting the Evidence

[79]                        The balancing of probative weight against prejudicial effect can be critical in deciding the admissibility of a party admission. This is a discretionary decision by the trial judge. Such decisions are to be reviewed with deference. The accused has not shown error in this exercise of the trial judge’s discretion. This is particularly so in light of the well-structured instructions provided to the jury on appropriate use of the party admission.

[80]                        The brother’s testimony contained weaknesses. He was unsure of the particular words that the accused said. He testified that he was not trying to listen and that he only heard one side of the conversation. He did not know whether the accused was responding to questions from his wife. The brother admitted he consumed alcohol before and after the call and that the accused was under the influence of intoxicants. The brother testified that the accused’s speech was impacted by the heroin he had taken. These factors decreased the probative value of the party admission.

[81]                          With respect to the prejudicial effect, I agree with Arbour J., dissenting, but not on this point, that juries are likely to give significant weight to confession-like evidence (R. v. Oickle, 2000 SCC 38, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 146). This Court has recognized the significant potential for prejudicial use of confessions (see, e.g., Hart, at para. 106) and this party admission was akin to a confession. The possibility for prejudicial use by the jury was real.

[82]                          When balancing the probative value and prejudicial effect, the trial judge noted “[t]he prejudicial effect can be ameliorated by a strong caution to the jury about what use can be made of the evidence” (para. 21). The trial judge provided such a caution on the proper use of the admission at issue. This demonstrates the trial judge was mindful of potential prejudice. The trial judge told the jury that it was up to them to decide whether the statements attributed by the brother to the accused had been made. They were to “[c]onsider the circumstances in which the conversation took place [and to b]ear in mind anything else that may make the witness’s evidence more or less reliable” (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 197). The trial judge methodically addressed the weaknesses in the brother’s testimony in the jury instructions. She emphasized that the brother heard only one side of the conversation and that he did not recall the exact words that the accused said. She noted that the accused had consumed alcohol and heroin prior to the call, and that those intoxicants could have affected what he said. The judge made clear that it was for the jury to determine whether the accused had used a particular phrase and what was meant by it. The judge told the jury they could ignore the admission if they were uncertain as to what was said or what it meant. She told the jury that they could not rely on the brother’s testimony as to the accused’s state of mind. Rather, it was for the jury to consider such matters.

[83]                          The trial judge provided the jury with clear and effective instructions on proper use of the brother’s testimony. The instructions gave the jury the guidance needed to weigh the evidence in accordance with legal principles. As such, the instructions effectively and adequately limited the possibility of prejudicial use.

[84]                          In light of the foregoing, the trial judge did not err in admitting the brother’s testimony as to what he overheard the accused say.

B.            Jury Question Issue

[85]                          I am in substantial agreement with the reasons of the Court of Appeal on the Jury Question Issue. The jury’s question was not ambiguous and the trial judge answered it correctly. Notwithstanding my agreement, I wish to underscore two points.

[86]                          First, the accused argues on appeal that the jury question demonstrated confusion as to the intent needed for murder and that needed for manslaughter. However, the accused’s counsel at trial (not appellate counsel) was adamant that this was not what the jury’s question related to. That trial counsel advocated for a certain response to a jury’s question is not determinative of the issue on appeal, but it is an important factor for consideration (R. v. Jacquard, 1997 CanLII 374 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at para. 38; Araya, at para. 51). While the burden of perfection should not be placed on trial counsel, they are the ones most attuned to the accused’s interests. In this case, trial counsel pivoted away from intent and suggested that the trial judge provide to the jury an “expanded definition of bodily harm” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 330). This approach likely represented trial counsel’s view as to how to answer the question correctly, in a manner beneficial to his client. I see no error in the trial judge’s handling of the question, particularly in light of trial counsel’s submissions on this point.

[87]                          Second, there is no merit to the accused’s argument that the definition of “bodily harm” in s. 2 of the Criminal Code does not apply to s. 229(a)(ii), which defines murder. The meaning of the phrase “bodily harm” is consistent throughout the Criminal Code. When Parliament means to deviate from the meaning of “bodily harm”, it does so by adding qualifying words (e.g., “grievous bodily harm” in s. 25(3)). No authority from this Court, including R. v. Miljevic, 2011 SCC 8, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 203, should be read as suggesting otherwise. The accused’s argument that murder requires bodily harm that is serious, dangerous or grave seems to stem from an inaccurate understanding of the model jury instructions. The words that he suggests describe bodily harm — dangerous, serious, grave — concern foreseeability. To reiterate, the definition of “bodily harm” set out in s. 2 applies to s. 229(a)(ii).

VI.         Conclusion

[88]                          I would allow the Crown’s appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal, and restore the accused’s conviction for second degree murder.

 

                  The following are the reasons delivered by

 

                    Karakatsanis and Brown JJ. —

[89]                        We would dismiss this appeal. We do not disagree with our colleagues’ framework for assessing relevance and probative value. What divides us is its application here. In our view, for the reasons of Justice Goepel at the Court of Appeal, a jury could not ascertain the meaning or relevance of the overheard statements (2021 BCCA 41, 400 C.C.C. (3d) 131). As well, their prejudicial effect outweighed any tenuous probative value they may have had. The overheard statements were inadmissible.

[90]                        On the evidence before the jury, it was impossible to know what Schneider said to his wife during the overheard phone call. The witness, Schneider’s brother, did not know the words that he heard. He was deliberately trying not to listen to the 13‑minute conversation. He neither participated in the conversation nor heard both sides of it. He acknowledged that he did not know what was said, and did not even recall knowing the substance of what was said. Initially, he testified in examination‑in‑chief that he heard Schneider say, “I did it. I killed her” about half‑way into the phone call (A.R., vol. II, at p. 170). He then clarified that he could not say those were the exact words spoken but that this was “the gist” of Schneider’s side of the conversation (A.R., vol. II, at p. 171). It appears that this “gist” was derived from a statement he had heard six or seven minutes earlier in the conversation and, the Crown says, from the trauma of having accompanied his brother during a suicide attempt. In cross‑examination, the witness confirmed that because he did not know Schneider’s exact words, they may have just been something like “I did it” and that the words — whatever they were — could have come at the beginning, middle or end of a longer sentence (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 189‑90).

[91]                        At trial, the Crown sought to tender the words overheard by Schneider’s brother as an admission of responsibility for the death of the victim, Natsumi Kogawa. In closing submissions, the Crown stated that Schneider was overheard telling his wife “I did it” or “I killed her” ⸺ though also acknowledging the exact words spoken were unknown ⸺ and told the jury that “you can infer from these words that he intended to kill Natsumi Kogawa or meant to kill Natsumi Kogawa” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 286).

[92]                        Assessing the relevance of Schneider’s brother’s testimony (including the Crown’s own interpretive gloss thereon) is an exercise in pure speculation. The Crown’s reliance on “context” to assist in identifying the relevance of the witness’s “gist” of the conversation is not only a strain; it is also far more harmful than it is helpful. For the Crown, this “context” includes the fact that the brother knew Schneider, that they had talked about the victim in the days leading up to the phone call, that Schneider told his brother some details of his relationship with Ms. Kogawa and that her body could be found in a suitcase prior to the phone conversation, that the brother was physically present for the phone conversation and the attempted suicide, and that he had an understanding of the “tone” of the conversation. These factors add nothing to the assessment of what had been said during the phone call.

[93]                        Our colleagues overstate the significance of the Court of Appeal’s references to the “macro” and “micro” contexts (Rowe J.’s reasons, at paras. 6, 28 and 42). These statements were not intended to alter assessments of relevance. Rather, they were simply shorthand for what the majority and the dissent considered to be the relevant context. Justice DeWitt‑Van Oosten took a broader view of the relevant context (which, in our respectful view, overreached by considering the same irrelevant factors as the Crown), while Justice Goepel (correctly) confined himself to considering the context arising from the conversation itself. This is not to say that context beyond the immediate conversation can never inform the meaning of statements made within the conversation. Rather, in this case, the Crown relies on contextual features beyond the conversation itself that were irrelevant, and there was insufficient context arising from the conversation itself to inform the meaning of the overheard statements.

[94]                        In our view, the Crown relies on “context” that is not only irrelevant, but which augments the prejudicial effect of admitting the statements even if they were relevant. The jury may have focused on aspects of the context which tended to implicate Schneider in the death ⸺ such as his statement about where Ms. Kogawa’s body was located ⸺ to reason that Schneider must have therefore admitted responsibility for the death. In R. v. Ferris (1994), 1994 ABCA 20 (CanLII), 149 A.R. 1 (C.A.), at para. 27, Conrad J.A. described the danger involved in this type of reasoning as follows:

There would be an enormous temptation for any trier of fact to look at the outside evidence that tends to implicate the accused in the murder, use those facts to conclude that the accused probably committed the murder, and that therefore he admitted that he did. That finding would then be used to raise the probability of guilt to a conclusion of guilt. The danger implicit in that type of circuitous reasoning is obvious.

This very concern arises in the instant case where the jury was left to assess the logical relevance of a “gist”, unaccompanied by any recollection of what was said, or at least any recollection of the substance of what was said.

[95]                        The trial judge did not explicitly identify any dangers of admitting the evidence of the overheard statements or how they might impact the fairness of the trial. She simply concluded that “[t]he prejudicial effect can be ameliorated by a strong caution to the jury about what use can be made of the evidence” (2018 BCSC 2546, at para. 21, reproduced in A.R., vol. I, at p. 5). In our view, the jury instruction did not cure the prejudice. It presupposed that the jury could decide what Schneider said despite having no basis in the evidence to do so.

[96]                        We conclude that the evidence of the overheard statements should not have been admitted. We acknowledge that the threshold for logical relevance is low. But it is still a threshold, in that it must “increase or diminish the probability of the existence of a fact in issue” (R. v. Arp, 1998 CanLII 769 (SCC), [1998] 3 S.C.R. 339, at para. 38, citing R. Eggleston, Evidence, Proof and Probability (2nd ed. 1978), at p. 83). If Schneider’s brother’s testimony meets this threshold, it would be difficult to conceive of anything Schneider might have said (or might be felt to have said), howsoever partial, oblique or indistinct, that would not be “relevant”. In any event, when the potential for misuse is measured against the absence of any significant probative value, the result is that the evidence should have been removed from the jury’s consideration altogether.

[97]                        We would therefore dismiss the appeal.

                    Kasirer J. —

I.               Overview

[1]                             When questioned at a police station in connection with a murder investigation, Russell Steven Tessier was not told that he had the right to remain silent. He was not cautioned that, if he did speak to the authorities, what he said could be taken down and used as evidence in court. While he did not confess, Mr. Tessier’s answers to police questions included comments that the prosecution sought to introduce at trial to show that he committed the crime. At the time of the interviews, Mr. Tessier was not under arrest and he was not physically detained. The parties disagree whether he had become a suspect over the course of the interviews and whether he had been psychologically detained by reason of the police conduct at the station.

[2]                             The statements were admitted after a voir dire at trial. Mr. Tessier was later convicted of first degree murder. The Court of Appeal decided that the trial judge committed legal errors when considering whether the statements had been made voluntarily, in particular by misapprehending the fairness rationale of the confessions rule, the operating mind doctrine associated with voluntariness and the proper test for determining whether Mr. Tessier was a suspect at the time. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered.

[3]                             The principal issue raised on appeal to the Court is whether the Crown met its heavy burden to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Mr. Tessier’s statements were voluntary pursuant to the common law confessions rule. The Court of Appeal said the trial judge failed to address the key question in this case: whether, in the absence of a caution, Mr. Tessier had been denied a meaningful choice to speak to the police “knowing that he was not required to answer police questions, or that anything he did say would be taken down and could be used in evidence” (2020 ABCA 289, 12 Alta. L.R. (7th) 55, at para. 54 (emphasis in original)). The appeal bears upon two related doctrinal questions under the confessions rule: first, the requirements of the operating mind doctrine and, second, the impact of the absence of a caution on voluntariness prior to detention or arrest.

[4]                             It has often been said that the proper application of the confessions rule aspires to strike the right balance between the individual and societal interests at play in police questioning: on the one hand, protecting the accused from improper interrogation by the police and, on the other, providing the authorities with the latitude they need to ask difficult questions to investigate and solve crime (R. v. Oickle, 2000 SCC 38, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 33). Understanding the impact of the absence of a caution on voluntariness in the pre-detention phase, and in particular on the fairness considerations that underlie the confessions rule, is integral to that balance.

[5]                             In R. v. Singh, 2007 SCC 48 [2007] 3 S.C.R. 405, Charron J. provided helpful guidance for persons in authority undertaking criminal investigations: “Even if the suspect has not formally been arrested and is not obviously under detention, police officers are well advised to give the police caution . . .” (para. 33). One understands Charron J.’s sensible intuition. While a proper caution will not guarantee that statements given thereafter are voluntary, it stands to reason that proving the accused made a free choice to speak to the authorities will be easier for the Crown if a caution is given. Because a suspect is more vulnerable to making involuntary statements than a mere witness or a person not involved in the crime, the presence or absence of a police caution is an “important” factor in answering the question of voluntariness upon which the admissibility of statements will turn (Boudreau v. The King, 1949 CanLII 26 (SCC), [1949] S.C.R. 262, at p. 267).

[6]                             What happens when the police question a suspect without providing the caution recommended in Singh? Mr. Tessier argues here that the trial judge should have recognized that he was subject to a degree of control by the authorities that mandated a caution to guard against an unfair denial of his free and meaningful choice to speak to the police.

[7]                             Charron J. was careful to say only that the police are “well advised” or should provide suspects with a caution; her remark was not in the order of a bright-line mandatory rule which, one infers, she sensed would upset the balance struck by the confessions rule. The failure to provide a caution is not in itself fatal to admissibility (see M. Vauclair and T. Desjardins, in collaboration with P. Lachance, Traité général de preuve et de procédure pénales 2022 (29th ed. 2022), at No. 38.28). But that this Court took the step to recommend a caution for suspects in Singh is an indication at common law that this lack of a caution is not without consequence on the type of proof required of the Crown to establish the voluntariness of the statements given.

[8]                             As part of its persuasive burden to prove voluntariness beyond a reasonable doubt at trial, the Crown must, in my view, show that the absence of a caution did not undermine the suspect’s free choice to speak to the police as part of the contextual examination of voluntariness. It is an important factor that must be addressed by the Crown by pointing in particular to circumstances that prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the suspect possessed an operating mind and voluntariness was not otherwise impugned. Generally, the operating mind doctrine requires the Crown to show that the accused possessed the limited cognitive ability to understand what they were saying and to comprehend that the statement might be used as evidence in criminal proceedings (R. v. Whittle, 1994 CanLII 55 (SCC), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 914, at p. 939). Where the police do not provide a caution in the circumstances in which, as Charron J. says, they would be well advised to do so, the Crown must show further that the police conduct did not unfairly frustrate the suspect’s ability to understand that what they were saying could be used in evidence, that they were not subject to police trickery and that there were no circumstances that would otherwise cast doubt on voluntariness.

[9]                             Drawing on scholarly commentary on the burden of proof relating to the operating mind dimension of voluntariness, I would recognize that the absence of a caution for a suspect constitutes prima facie evidence that they were unfairly denied their choice to speak to the police (see S. N. Lederman, M. K. Fuerst and H. C. Stewart, Sopinka, Lederman & Bryant: The Law of Evidence in Canada (6th ed. 2022), at ¶8.119). In circumstances in which the accused has raised credible evidence that their status at the time of questioning was that of a suspect, the presence or absence of a caution takes on meaningful significance. Where the accused further puts the lack of a caution and their increased legal jeopardy into evidence — by cross‑examining Crown witnesses or otherwise — they have met their evidentiary burden that raises the issue as to whether their statements were freely given. It then falls to the Crown to discharge its persuasive burden by proving either that the accused was not in legal jeopardy, in that they were a mere witness and not a suspect, or that the absence of a caution was without consequence and that the statements were, beyond a reasonable doubt and in view of the context as a whole, voluntary. This would give substance to the recommendation formulated by Charron J. in Singh for trial judges seeking to weigh the importance of a lack of caution.

[10]                        Beyond merely showing that the person questioned had an operating mind, there may also be circumstances in which the absence of a caution is in point of fact a willful failure by the police to give a caution. This might reflect a deliberate tactic by the police to manipulate the individual into thinking that they are a mere witness and not a suspect so that, in making a statement, their jeopardy is not at risk. Where the failure to caution a suspect amounts to trickery, the effect of the police conduct may have an impact on voluntariness and should be analyzed in that light (see Oickle, at paras. 67 and 91).

[11]                        As Charron J. observed in Singh on the question of voluntariness, “the focus is on the conduct of the police and its effect on the suspect’s ability to exercise his or her free will” (para. 36). If the Crown cannot prove that the absence of a caution had no impact on voluntariness, the prima facie evidence of involuntariness raised by the absence of a caution will lead to a conclusion of inadmissibility. The absence of a caution weighs heavily because, where unaddressed, it represents prima facie evidence that the suspect has been unfairly denied their choice to speak to the police and that, as a consequence, the statement cannot be considered voluntary. This does not displace the ultimate burden on the Crown to prove voluntariness beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, it emphasizes the legal significance of the absence of a caution as a potential sign of involuntariness where a person is a suspect.

[12]                        But to be clear: insisting on a caution in all circumstances where a suspect is questioned by police, or requiring that the Crown prove what amounts to a waiver of that caution, are not conditions of voluntariness. In my respectful view, the Court of Appeal mistakenly imposed this high standard based on proof of actual, subjective knowledge. Where knowledge can be shown, courts have forgiven the lack of caution, but just as the caution is not obligatory, proof of actual knowledge of the right to silence or the consequences of speaking to prove voluntariness is not either. That high standard applied in all cases in the pre‑detention phase of an investigation could upset the balance of individual and social interests upon which the confessions rule rests.

[13]                        For the reasons that follow, I propose to restore Mr. Tessier’s conviction for first degree murder rendered by the jury. I agree with the Court of Appeal that some of the trial judge’s explanations of the voluntariness rule were incomplete. However, with the utmost respect, I disagree that these amounted to reviewable legal errors that undermined the finding at trial that Mr. Tessier’s statements to the police were voluntarily made. Even in the absence of a caution, and even if one were to consider Mr. Tessier to have been a suspect at the time of questioning, the record confirms that the trial judge’s determination on voluntariness should not have been disturbed on appeal.

II.            Background

[14]                        Allan Berdahl was found dead in a ditch by a rural road close to Carstairs, Alberta, on March 16, 2007. The police immediately sought out several individuals connected to the deceased for interviews, including Mr. Berdahl’s friend, Mr. Tessier. On the morning of March 17, 2007, Mr. Tessier received several phone calls from the police seeking to arrange an interview at the RCMP detachment at Didsbury, near Carstairs. Mr. Tessier, who was staying with friends in Didsbury, agreed to come to the station. He had a friend drive him there and wait for him outside.

[15]                        Sgt. Alexander “Sandy” White first met Mr. Tessier at the detachment counter at 12:55 p.m. and escorted him to a room with a closed, unlocked door for the interview. Sgt. White was an experienced homicide officer. He was dressed in plainclothes and unarmed. Mr. Tessier was not searched. Sgt. White did not caution Mr. Tessier that he had the right to remain silent or that his statements could be used in evidence. Nor did he speak of the right to retain and instruct counsel under s. 10(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Mr. Tessier was told and he understood that the interview was being audio and video recorded.

[16]                        The first interview lasted about 105 minutes. Prior to the meeting, Sgt. White had some information about the victim and his connection to Mr. Tessier. Notably, Mr. Berdahl was found with severe head trauma. Tire tracks, blood spatter, footprints and two cigarette butts had been found nearby. He knew what kind of truck Mr. Tessier drove. He was aware that Mr. Tessier had recently been in the company of Mr. Berdahl and was thought to be the last person to have seen the victim alive. He knew that the tire imprints found at the scene indicated a wheel diameter compatible with several types of vehicle, one of which could have been the make owned by Mr. Tessier. Sgt. White also had learned from the victim’s ex‑girlfriend that Mr. Tessier had “a falling out” with Mr. Berdahl about a car and money (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 26‑27).

[17]                        Mr. Tessier was advised that the RCMP was investigating the homicide of Mr. Berdahl. The purpose of the interview, he was told, was to obtain a biography of the victim. Sgt. White did not expressly say that Mr. Tessier was free to leave when he wanted.

[18]                        Over the course of the first interview, Mr. Tessier provided information about Mr. Berdahl, his relationship to him, and Mr. Tessier’s movements in the days leading up to the death. Mr. Tessier volunteered that Mr. Berdahl’s ex‑girlfriend “hate[d]” the victim (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 102). He said that Mr. Berdahl was a drug user, that he owed “a lot of people” money and was involved in illegal activities (p. 103). Mr. Tessier had been with Mr. Berdahl until the evening of March 15, he said, at which time they parted ways as Mr. Berdahl was leaving for Winnipeg. Sgt. White challenged Mr. Tessier, noting he appeared “mixed up” and “bothered” and should “[t]ell the truth” (p. 117). He asked if there was any reason why Mr. Tessier’s DNA would be on the side of the road south of Didsbury. Mr. Tessier answered no. He told Sgt. White the make and model of his car, as well as the brand of cigarettes he smoked, noting that he and Mr. Berdahl often exchanged cigarettes. On more than one occasion, Mr. Tessier asked what happened to Mr. Berdahl. At one point Sgt. White said “I’m only here looking for the truth and that’s – that’s my job. . . . And you hold the truth as far as I’m concerned, Steve” (p. 127). Mr. Tessier answered that he did not know.

[19]                        About mid‑way through the interview, Sgt. White asked Mr. Tessier for a DNA sample so the police could compare it to any DNA found at the crime scene which, he said, was a technique used as a matter of course to eliminate people from investigation. Providing the DNA sample was voluntary, noted Sgt. White. He then asked Mr. Tessier if he thought the murder was planned and what happened in between Mr. Berdahl being at the house and turning up dead on the side of the road, to which Mr. Tessier said, “I’m scared to answer questions, I don’t know what to do” (p. 126). Sgt. White asked Mr. Tessier if he killed Mr. Berdahl. “No I didn’t”, Mr. Tessier responded (p. 127). Sgt. White asked if Mr. Tessier could “prove” he did not do it (p. 127). Sgt. White again requested a DNA sample. Mr. Tessier stated, “Why wouldn’t I?” (p. 129). Mr. Tessier then asked to go outside for a smoke, which he did unattended. While outside, Mr. Tessier consulted with his friend, who advised him not to provide the sample. He was observed by an officer while outside. Upon returning, Mr. Tessier declined to provide the sample as he did not want to be “painted into a corner” (p. 130). He explained, “I’m the only person that you guys got and that’s not good. . . . [T]his is bothering me” (p. 130). Mr. Tessier did allow Sgt. White to take a photograph of the sole of his shoe.

[20]                        Sgt. White then accompanied Mr. Tessier outside and, soon after, the interview concluded with Mr. Tessier inviting police to his home in Calgary to inspect and collect some of Mr. Berdahl’s possessions, as he had been staying with Mr. Tessier recently. Mr. Tessier then asked if he was free to go. Even though his friend was present with a car, Mr. Tessier asked Sgt. White to drive him back to his truck. Following the interview, a briefing was held at the detachment and a police surveillance team was put in place to observe Mr. Tessier.

[21]                        Soon after the first interview, Mr. Tessier called Sgt. White and left him several voice messages, seeking to provide him with additional information. Receiving no response, Mr. Tessier returned that same day to the Didsbury detachment at about 5:10 p.m. looking for Sgt. White. A second interview began. Sgt. White informed Mr. Tessier that he was turning the recorder on again. Mr. Tessier said that he had recently retrieved a firearm from a shooting range, and he wanted a police officer to come to his apartment in Calgary to confirm that it was still in his bedroom closet. Sgt. White and another officer followed Mr. Tessier to his apartment. Once there, Mr. Tessier showed officers the gun case, but there was no gun inside of it. Mr. Tessier asked Sgt. White if he should call a lawyer, to which Sgt. White responded that they were there “to investigate Al’s death” (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 129‑30). Sgt. White then read Mr. Tessier his rights and cautioned him.

[22]                        Mr. Tessier was charged with first degree murder in 2015 when his DNA was matched to a cigarette butt found near the scene.

III.         Proceedings Below

A.           Voir Dire Ruling, 2018 ABQB 387 (Yamauchi J.)

[23]                        A pre‑trial voir dire was held to determine whether the Crown had met its burden to show that Mr. Tessier’s statements were voluntary and thus admissible under the common law confessions rule. The trial judge also considered Mr. Tessier’s argument as to whether the police had breached his Charter right to silence and right to counsel and that, as a result, the evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2).

[24]                        In respect of the confessions rule, the trial judge concluded that the statements had been made voluntarily.

[25]                        He wrote that the policy rationale for the right to silence and the confessions rule “is to prevent the state from receiving false confessions” (para. 16, reproduced in A.R., vol. I, at p. 16). The evaluation of voluntariness is contextual and a court must consider all the relevant factors relating to how the state authorities obtained the statement, including the existence of threats, promises, or inducements; oppressive conditions; the lack of an operating mind; and police trickery (para. 18, citing Oickle, at paras. 47‑71).

[26]                        Based on a review of the relevant evidence, including the recordings of the interviews, the trial judge observed there were no threats, promises or inducements by the police and that no inadmissible or non‑existent evidence was used when speaking to Mr. Tessier (paras. 36‑37).

[27]                        The trial judge considered whether Mr. Tessier lacked an operating mind during the interviews. Pointing to Whittle, he wrote that the operating mind “does not imply a higher degree of awareness than knowledge of what the accused is saying”, and that they are speaking to police officers who can use it to their detriment (para. 39, citing Whittle, at p. 936). Noting that Mr. Tessier was neither impaired by reason of drugs or alcohol, nor suffering from a mental disability, the trial judge concluded that he had the limited degree of cognitive ability associated with an operating mind on the date of the interviews (para. 41).

[28]                        At the time, Mr. Tessier was not a suspect, nor was he arrested or detained. Even if he were a suspect, there was no duty to provide a caution. The failure to caution a suspect could unfairly deny the suspect the choice to speak with authorities, which is a factor courts must consider when deciding whether a suspect made a statement voluntarily (para. 45, citing R. v. Morrison, [2000] O.J. No. 5733 (QL), 2000 CarswellOnt 5811 (WL) (S.C.J.)). Unfairness did not arise here because there was no misconduct on the part of Sgt. White. Mr. Tessier was not treated oppressively. Sgt. White allowed Mr. Tessier to leave the interview room when he requested to go outside for a cigarette.

[29]                        The trial judge concluded the pointed questions asked by Sgt. White were neither aggressive nor intimidating within the meaning of Oickle and that, as such, they did not mean that Mr. Tessier was a suspect. He considered Charron J.’s comments in Singh that a police caution should be given to a suspect, but noted that it was not a direction (para. 47). Based on the information he had at that point in the investigation, Sgt. White’s belief that Mr. Tessier was not culpably involved in the murder of Mr. Berdahl was objectively reasonable (para. 51).

[30]                        The trial judge further held that Mr. Tessier was not detained and, as a result, the rights under s. 10 of the Charter did not arise. He specifically rejected the argument that Mr. Tessier had been psychologically detained. Mr. Tessier’s presence at the detachment was a response to a police request rather than to a command (para. 66). He arrived by his own means (para. 69). Mr. Tessier had been free to go and, when he did leave, he himself chose to ride with Sgt. White to his truck (para. 71). Informing Mr. Tessier of the right to counsel at this juncture was not required (paras. 82‑83).

[31]                        Given the conclusions that Mr. Tessier’s statements were made voluntarily and that he was not psychologically detained, the statements were admissible at trial.

B.            Court of Appeal of Alberta, 2020 ABCA 289, 12 Alta. L.R. (7th) 55 (Schutz, Khullar and Antonio JJ.A.)

[32]                        The Court of Appeal observed that the trial judge made “legal errors” with respect to the confessions rule. On that basis, the appeal was allowed. While the trial judge’s decision that the statements were voluntary was a factual one deserving of deference on appeal, the Court of Appeal wrote that “if all of the relevant circumstances are not considered, the [c]ourt owes no deference to the trial judge’s conclusion on voluntariness” (para. 23).

[33]                        By reason of an erroneous understanding of the modern confessions rule, the trial judge did not turn his mind to whether, in the absence of a caution as to the right to silence, Mr. Tessier understood that what he said to police could be used against him, and that he was not obliged to say anything (para. 46). That legal error was traced to the trial judge’s failure to recognize the fairness rationale for the confessions rule and the relevance of the repute of the administration of justice. For a statement to be considered voluntary, the Crown must show the accused had a meaningful right to remain silent when questioned by police. Instead, the trial judge wrongly focussed on avoiding false confessions (at para. 47) and failed to undertake the contextual analysis of the relevant factors mandated by the jurisprudence (para. 48).

[34]                        This was most evident in the trial judge’s treatment of the operating mind doctrine. It was erroneous, the court said, to conclude that an operating mind requires only a limited degree of cognitive ability to understand what is being said. Whittle does not provide a full account of the factors to consider in deciding whether someone has made a meaningful choice to speak to the police (para. 51). Beyond an operating mind, voluntariness also implies “an awareness about what is at stake in speaking to persons in authority, or declining to assist them” (para. 52, citing R. v. Worrall, [2002] O.J. No. 2711 (QL), 2002 CarswellOnt 5171 (WL) (S.C.J.), at para. 106). It was never in dispute that Mr. Tessier possessed minimal cognitive capacity. However, the trial judge did not address whether Mr. Tessier “made a meaningful choice to speak to the police knowing that he was not required to answer police questions, or that anything he did say would be taken down and could be used in evidence” (para. 54 (emphasis in original)).

[35]                        The trial judge also erred by elevating the “suspect” rule of thumb to a legal test, in particular in respect of the relevance of the absence of a caution. Undue emphasis was placed on the fact that Sgt. White did not subjectively perceive Mr. Tessier as a suspect, and thus was not required to provide a caution (para. 55).

[36]                        A new trial was thus required to consider whether, in the absence of a caution, Mr. Tessier had made a meaningful choice to speak to the police (para. 60).

[37]                        The court briefly discussed the psychological detention issue, but chose not to resolve it. It noted that it was not necessarily an error to consider the factors outlined in earlier cases, provided full consideration is given to the factors in R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, in answering the key question: Would the police conduct cause a reasonable person to conclude that he or she was not free to go and had to comply with the police direction (para. 69)?

IV.         Issues

[38]                        This appeal raises the following two issues:

•        Firstly, in the pre‑detention phase of the criminal investigation, how did the absence of a caution during police questioning affect the voluntariness of Mr. Tessier’s statements under the confessions rule? Was he unfairly denied a meaningful choice to speak to police such that his statements must be considered as involuntary and thus inadmissible?

•         Secondly, was Mr. Tessier psychologically detained in breach of his Charter rights and, if so, what impact did that have on the admissibility of his statements? In particular, should attendance at a police station for an officer‑requested meeting be treated as a detention, absent steps taken by the police to communicate the contrary?

[39]                        There is overlap between these matters but it is useful to address the voluntariness question first. The confessions rule protects the right to silence at all times during an investigation whether or not the interviewee is in detention, whereas the residual Charter protections of the s. 7 right to silence arise only on detention (Singh, at para. 32; see also G. T. Trotter, “The Limits of Police Interrogation: The Limits of the Charter” (2008), 40 S.C.L.R. (2d) 293, at p. 302). I will address Mr. Tessier’s psychological detention argument and whether he met the burden that falls to him to show a breach of the Charter. However, in light of the Crown’s burden to show voluntariness under the confessions rule at common law, I find it convenient first to address his voluntariness claim which arises in the context of pre‑detention investigative questioning by the police, including his argument that he was a suspect at the time. The burden rests with the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the pre‑detention statements were voluntary. If it succeeds, there will be no breach of his s. 7 right to silence protected by the Charter because Mr. Tessier will have exercised a free choice to speak (Singh, at para. 25; R. v. Hebert, 1990 CanLII 118 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151, at p. 184; R. v. Timm (1998), 1998 CanLII 12523 (QC CA), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 306 (Que. C.A.)). The issue as to whether Mr. Tessier was psychologically detained and, if so, whether a breach of his s. 10(b) Charter right to counsel warrants the exclusion of the statements from evidence at trial will be examined thereafter.

V.           Analysis

[40]                        As a preliminary matter, I propose to address the Court of Appeal’s conclusion that the trial judge committed reviewable errors of law. I am of the respectful view that the Court of Appeal was mistaken to order a new trial on this basis. Clarifying this at the start helps bring into focus the key issues in the case: the impact of the lack of caution on the choice to speak to police in the pre‑detention phase of the criminal investigation and the question of Mr. Tessier’s psychological detention at the police station.

A.           Correctness of the Trial Judge’s Reasons

(1)         Submissions of the Parties and Standard of Review

[41]                        The Crown defends the trial judge’s reasons and says he made no reviewable errors in law. In its submission, the Court of Appeal itself erred in law in its discussion of the concept of meaningful choice and, in particular, of the operating mind doctrine. The court introduced a higher standard by which the Crown must effectively provide proof of actual, subjective knowledge — proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew they did not have to say anything to police and that anything said could be taken down and used in evidence. By misidentifying the operating mind test set by this Court in Whittle and confirmed in Oickle, the Court of Appeal wrongly applied what amounts to a waiver standard to proof of voluntariness: it inadvertently created a requirement by which police must caution individuals even when they are not detained or even suspected of committing an offence. A waiver standard, under which an absolute right to silence is assumed and all statements are excluded unless the right has been waived by the accused, was explicitly rejected by McLachlin J. in Hebert, who said “[t]here is nothing in the rules underpinning the s. 7 right to silence or other provisions of the Charter that suggests that the scope of the right to silence should be extended this far” (p. 183). It risks stifling basic and uncontroversial police practices and upsets the balance between the social interest in investigating crime and the legitimate aspects of the confessions rule that serve to protect the accused. The trial judge, it says, applied the correct legal principles and deference should be shown to his findings of fact, absent proof of a palpable and overriding error.

[42]                        Mr. Tessier defends the Court of Appeal’s identification of legal errors that, he says, undermined the trial judge’s conclusion on voluntariness. The trial judge took a restrictive view of the confessions rule linked exclusively to the reliability of the statement made. He neglected fairness considerations that require the Crown to show that persons interviewed by police should be informed of their right to silence and provided with a free and meaningful choice to speak to police as a measure of voluntariness. The trial judge erred in respect of the operating mind doctrine by tying it to the requirement of limited cognitive ability. As the Court of Appeal observed, a meaningful choice to speak to the authorities commands not just limited cognitive ability, but also an awareness of what is at stake when making a statement to a person in authority. This includes an assessment of an interviewee’s actual knowledge of their right to silence. When an interviewee’s liberty is potentially in jeopardy, the police should provide a caution prior to questioning. In these circumstances, a person must have a meaningful choice to speak based on information about their corresponding legal rights. Admissibility should turn on the exercise of this meaningful choice irrespective of whether a person is a suspect, person of interest, or witness.

[43]                        It is noteworthy that before the Court of Appeal, Mr. Tessier argued that the trial judge erred in finding that Sgt. White did not suspect that he was involved in the homicide and that the trial judge gave “insufficient weight” to the fact that police did not caution him (para. 22). Even as he defends the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Mr. Tessier renews those arguments before this Court. These arguments allege essentially errors of fact and errors of mixed law and fact in the measure of voluntariness. A finding of voluntariness calls for deference unless it can be shown that it represents a palpable and overriding error (Oickle, at paras. 22 and 71; see also Singh, at para. 51; R. v. Ewert, 1992 CanLII 35 (SCC), [1992] 3 S.C.R. 161, at p. 162; Ward v. The Queen, 1979 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1979] 2 S.C.R. 30, at pp. 41‑42; Mom v. R., 2018 QCCA 1381, at para. 23 (CanLII); Legault v. R., 2017 QCCA 1769, at para. 3 (CanLII); R. v. D.N., 2018 BCCA 18, 358 C.C.C. (3d) 471, at para. 62; R. v. Cunningham, 2017 ABCA 169, 349 C.C.C. (3d) 82, at para. 4). An appellate court may only intervene where the error is “overriding and determinative in the assessment of the balance of probabilities with respect to that factual issue” (Schwartz v. Canada, 1996 CanLII 217 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 254, at para. 35). The standard of review associated with the finding of voluntariness is tied to the idea that the analysis under the confessions rule must be a contextual one in which bright‑line rules are few. Where the law is properly understood and the relevant circumstances considered, the trial judge is best placed to measure that context and make the relevant findings.

(2)         The Trial Judge Did Not Err in Law

[44]                        The Court of Appeal identified three errors of law committed by the trial judge. First, it said he overlooked the fairness rationale for the confessions rule (see paras. 6 and 47). Second, he adopted a flawed understanding of the operating mind doctrine which he confined to whether the individual had basic cognitive capacity. The trial judge is said to have ignored whether Mr. Tessier made a meaningful choice to speak based on an awareness of what was at stake (see paras. 50‑52). And third, he erred in law when he decided that because Sgt. White did not subjectively perceive Mr. Tessier as a suspect, he was not required to give him a caution and that, as a result, the absence of a caution did not impact on voluntariness (see para. 55).

[45]                        While the criticism of some of the trial judge’s imprecise statements of the law relating to confessions is not unfounded, I respectfully disagree with the Court of Appeal that these reflected “legal errors” that warranted appellate intervention. Appellate courts charged with reviewing the work of trial judges should not read single sentences in isolation, however incongruous they might seem standing alone as statements of the law. A court of appeal must consider the law as it is presented in the whole of the judgment under review (see, e.g., R. v. R.E.M., 2008 SCC 51, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 16). In light of the presumption that a judge knows the law, including the settled principles of law with which they are regularly confronted, this is the right course for appellate review for weighing supposed errors of law as well as those of fact (see R.E.M., at para. 45; R. v. Burns, 1994 CanLII 127 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656, at p. 664; R. v. Sheppard, 2002 SCC 26, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, at para. 54).

[46]                        Read as a whole, the trial judgment here indicates plainly that the judge identified the correct legal principles and did not commit reviewable errors of law in the manner identified in Oickle, at para. 22. I propose to turn briefly to each of the supposed legal errors to explain why there were none. In my respectful view, the complaints that he was insufficiently attentive to fairness considerations, or erred in weighing whether Mr. Tessier had an operating mind, are determinations bearing on whether the statements given were voluntary, which are questions of fact.

(a)           The Fairness Error

[47]                        While it is true that the trial judge did not mention the fairness rationale for the confessions rule at para. 16, his incomplete statement is not a reviewable error of law when read in light of the balance of his reasons. The trial judge cited and applied fairness principles throughout his judgment.

[48]                        The trial judge considered Whittle at length, a case, as Sopinka J. emphasized at p. 932, that recognized the strong undercurrent of fairness to the accused in the criminal process as part of the confessions rule. The trial judge quoted extensively from Morrison, a case principally about fairness, including excerpts where the judge in that decision recognized that suspects have a right to choose freely whether to speak to the authorities or remain silent (para. 43, citing Morrison, at para. 57). Most importantly, the trial judge drew from the holding in Morrison that the failure to caution must “effectively and unfairly deny the suspect the choice” to speak and concluded that Mr. Tessier had not been treated unfairly in all of the circumstances (paras. 45‑46, citing Morrison, at para. 57). Moreover, the trial judge asked the ultimate question posed by Charron J. at para. 53 in Singh, namely whether the accused exercised free will by choosing to make a statement (para. 53). He also considered police trickery at para. 21, the branch of the confessions rule generally associated with fairness (Oickle, at para. 69; see also L. Dufraimont, “The Common Law Confessions Rule in the Charter Era: Current Law and Future Directions” (2008), 40 S.C.L.R. (2d) 249, at pp. 253‑54).

[49]                        Despite an incomplete statement of the confessions rule at para. 16, these aspects of the trial judge’s analysis show an adequate engagement with the legal principles that include fairness as a rationale for the confessions rule. Whether fairness was given sufficient weight is a distinct matter — a question of fact, reviewable on a different standard — from the identification of fairness as a rationale of the legal test. No reviewable error was made on this point.

(b)         The Operating Mind Error

[50]                        The Court of Appeal says at para. 50 of its reasons that the trial judge failed to apply the operating mind test set forth in Whittle. It is true that, at one point in his judgment, the trial judge appears to embrace a narrow understanding of the test, pared down to the question of whether an interviewee has a “limited degree of cognitive ability to understand what he is saying” (para. 41). But as the Court of Appeal itself recognized, the trial judge quoted more liberally from Whittle at para. 38, including the relevant dicta that an accused not only have the ability to understand what they are saying, but also the ability to comprehend that the statement may be used as evidence in criminal proceedings.

[51]                        It appears to me that the Court of Appeal’s objection to the trial judge’s reasons in this regard is its sense that Whittle, contrary to the trial judge’s understanding of this point of law, “does not address what factors to consider in deciding whether someone made a meaningful choice” (para. 51). Yet as Whittle suggests at p. 932 of Sopinka J.’s reasons, the confessions rule, the right to silence and the right to counsel are together concerned with “preserving for the suspect the right to choose” and whether “the action of police authorities deprive[d] the suspect of making an effective choice by reason of coercion, trickery or misinformation or the lack of information”. In Whittle, it was determined that the operating mind consideration of the voluntariness test requires proof that the accused was capable of making a meaningful choice to speak to the police and that the choice was not improperly influenced by state action. The trial judge’s determination of the law relating to the operating mind was, when the judgment is read as a whole, not mistaken in a material way.

[52]                        Respectfully, the cases do not support the Court of Appeal’s wider interpretation of the operating mind doctrine. In the context of a detained or arrested suspect, the cases that employ the language of “choice” use it as a shorthand for voluntariness, to speak to the idea that a voluntary statement reflects an exercise of free choice which choice may be frustrated by the conduct of police (Boudreau, at pp. 269‑71; Whittle, at pp. 932 and 939; Hebert, at p. 181; see also Oickle, at paras. 24‑26; Singh, at paras. 35 and 53). The terms variously used in these cases, including “free”, “active” and “meaningful” choice, are not predicated on any normative difference existing between them. All have been invoked in the jurisprudence to convey that the choice is voluntarily exercised when it is the product of an operating mind, as well as the absence of other factors as the context indicates, including police tricks, that would otherwise impugn voluntariness. As to the operating mind cases, they merely refer to the limited cognitive ability of a person to comprehend, in the case of Horvath v. The Queen, 1979 CanLII 16 (SCC), [1979] 2 S.C.R. 376, the police caution or, in the case of Whittle, what is being said and that it may be used as evidence in criminal proceedings (Horvath, at p. 425; Whittle, at p. 939; see also Ward; R. v. Love, 2020 ABQB 689, 21 Alta. L.R. (7th) 248, at para. 53). The default assumption in the cases is that, absent a cognitive impairment, an operating mind exists. But the burden always rests with the Crown to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the statement was voluntary in light of the broader contextual analysis proposed in Oickle. An operating mind is of course a necessary but not sufficient condition.

[53]                        The statements concerning a free choice in the decided cases have been carefully tempered. Sopinka J. in Whittle explained that an accused is not entitled to a good or wise choice (p. 939). In doing so, he “implicitly rejected” the suggestion, as authors S. Penney, V. Rondinelli and J. Stribopoulos note, “that voluntariness might require a more thorough understanding of the consequence of speech” (Criminal Procedure in Canada (3rd ed. 2022), at ¶4.20, citing Clarkson v. The Queen, 1986 CanLII 61 (SCC), [1986] 1 S.C.R. 383, at pp. 393‑95; R. v. MacDonald-Pelrine, 2014 NSCA 6, 339 N.S.R. (2d) 277, at para. 38; see also H. Parent, Traité de droit criminel, t. IV, Les garanties juridiques (2nd ed. 2021), at pp. 61‑62). Previously, McLachlin J. in Hebert — who, parenthetically, subscribed to the opinion of Sopinka J. in Whittle — was quick to note that proof of subjective knowledge could prove to be an “impossible task”, and therefore should not form a part of what constitutes a choice to speak or remain silent (p. 177). In the particular context of a detainee tricked into confessing to an undercover police officer, she observed that a suspect’s choice is informed by the right to counsel, a Charter right which only arises upon detention. In other words, it is the exercise of the right to counsel upon detention which informs the right to choose, rather than any state of legal or other knowledge held by a person the moment they interact with police. The cases seek to preserve the balance between the right to silence and the legitimate law enforcement objectives of the state, which is why the language of meaningful, free or active choice has emphasized the overall voluntariness of the statement, rather than a minimum level of subjective knowledge. Indeed, the Court of Appeal rightly recognized that the latter approach would be “unworkable” as a general requirement for all interviews with the police (para. 39).

[54]                        On my reading, however, the Court of Appeal introduced a level of subjective knowledge beyond what the cases require when it held that “an operating mind is not the only mental element required for a statement to be voluntary” and that a meaningful choice requires “knowing that [one is] not required to answer police questions, or that anything [said] would be taken down and could be used in evidence” (paras. 29 and 54). I agree with the Crown that the standard as described by the court would effectively require proof of actual knowledge that the accused did not have to say anything to the police and that anything said could be taken down in evidence, which, as a practical matter, would oblige the Crown to prove that a police caution was given and properly understood.

[55]                        As the foregoing cases show, it is the Charter that introduces the necessity of a police caution at the moment of detention. There is good reason why the suspects in Hebert, Whittle, Oickle, and Singh were cautioned: they all were detained or arrested, such that the Charter mandated that certain information about the right to counsel, and by implication the right to silence, be communicated to them by the police. I would not expand the confessions rule where a person is not arrested or detained by adding an informational component to it that is absent from the settled jurisprudence.

[56]                        In my respectful view, proof of actual knowledge is not consonant with the law as it stands and would amount to an overextension of the operating mind doctrine that risks upsetting the balance between the individual and societal interests upon which the confessions rule is predicated. As the Court of Appeal itself noted (at para. 35), para. 36 of Singh stated that the question of voluntariness is an objective one, though the individual characteristics of the accused are relevant in applying the objective test. In essence, although the court acknowledged it would be unworkable for police to caution everyone at the outset of all interactions, it effectively introduced that standard by hinging the outcome of the voluntariness analysis on actual knowledge akin to the information contained in the police caution (Love, at paras. 38‑53). This error is most plain in its conclusion that the trial judge had to assess whether Mr. Tessier knew that he was not required to answer police questions (C.A. reasons, at para. 54).

[57]                        The Court of Appeal’s reading of Worrall led it to embrace a standard that appears to me to be more demanding than what Horvath and Whittle describe. The court stated that the operating mind doctrine involves an understanding that one is not obliged to answer police questions (para. 54). In Worrall, Watt J. wrote that the accused “was never told that he was not required to answer police questions”, which was a problem because “[v]oluntariness implies an awareness about what is at stake in speaking to persons in authority, or declining to assist them” (paras. 105‑6 (emphasis deleted)). However, I observe that the Court of Appeal for Ontario has not followed Worrall to the letter, and neither have other courts of appeal across the country; Whittle has been accepted as the proper statement of the law (see, e.g., Yergeau v. R., 2021 QCCA 1827, at para. 11 (CanLII); R. v. Baylis, 2015 ONCA 477, 326 C.C.C. (3d) 18, at para. 50; R. v. Ponace, 2019 MBCA 99, [2020] 3 W.W.R. 657, at para. 94; R. v. Lambert, 2018 NLCA 39, 363 C.C.C. (3d) 397, at paras. 8‑11; R. v. Bottineau, 2011 ONCA 194, 269 C.C.C. (3d) 227, at para. 94; see also Penney, Rondinelli and Stribopoulos, at ¶4.20). Instead, the Court of Appeal for Ontario has on occasion assumed, without deciding, that the suspect’s “awareness of consequences”, where established on the facts, could dispose of the issue of voluntariness (see R. v. M. (D.), 2012 ONCA 894, 295 C.C.C. (3d) 159, at paras. 44‑45; R. v. Pepping, 2016 ONCA 809, at para. 6 (CanLII)). The distinction between requiring awareness of what is at stake and considering such an awareness where established is an important one. Where established, positive knowledge can weigh in favour of voluntariness without making it a requirement. In any event, I read Watt J.’s statement as consonant with that of Beetz J. in Horvath, who said that “voluntariness implies an awareness of what is at stake” to refer to the importance of context to determine whether the absence of a caution impugns voluntariness in connection with a person who was hypnotized (p. 425).

[58]                        To conclude on this point, I see no reviewable error in the trial judge’s determination of the operating mind test. Instead, the view expressed by the Court of Appeal is that an operating mind is “not the only mental element required for a statement to be voluntary” (para. 29), which is out of step with the law in Whittle.

(c)           The Suspect Error

[59]                        I respectfully disagree with the Court of Appeal that the trial judge erred by “elevating the ‘suspect’ rule of thumb to a legal test” (para. 56). Trial judges throughout the country consistently apply the suspect test as a useful tool to assist them in assessing the impact of the failure to caution on the voluntariness of a statement (see Morrison, at paras. 50 and 54; R. v. Oland, 2018 NBQB 255, at paras. 43‑46 (CanLII); R. v. Smyth, 2006 CanLII 52358 (Ont. S.C.J.), at pp. 34‑36; R. v. Wong, 2017 ONSC 1501, at para. 64 (CanLII); R. v. Merritt, 2016 ONSC 7009, at para. 39 (CanLII); R. v. Higham, 2007 CanLII 20104 (Ont. S.C.J.), at paras. 5‑7). It was therefore appropriate for the trial judge to ask whether Mr. Tessier was a suspect. I further disagree that the trial judge was only guided by Sgt. White’s subjective perception of whether Mr. Tessier was a suspect (C.A. reasons, at para. 55). While he might well have been plainer in his reasons, the trial judge stated the essence of the test correctly, at para. 43, when he wrote that a suspect “is a person who, through information that the police collect during an investigation, viewed objectively, tends to implicate that person in a crime” (citing Morrison, at para. 50). It is true that Mr. Tessier, both before the Court of Appeal and this Court, argued that the trial judge failed to consider certain facts in coming to his conclusion that Mr. Tessier was not a suspect here. But that is a claim that the judge, through an omission, committed an error of fact rather than a reviewable error of law.

[60]                        With this clarification in mind, did the trial judge commit a reviewable error of fact in finding that Mr. Tessier was not a suspect?

[61]                        I accept the argument that the trial judge committed palpable errors in concluding that Mr. Tessier was not a suspect. There are two critical facts that, respectfully, the trial judge neglected to consider in his review of the circumstances and a third fact that, given these omissions, was misunderstood. First, at the start of the interview, when the police observed that Mr. Tessier did not arrive at the station in his own vehicle, another officer, Cst. Heidi Van Steelandt, was tasked with going to the place where he was staying in Didsbury to examine Mr. Tessier’s Ford pickup. It was confirmed that the tires of that vehicle could match the traces observed at the scene of the homicide. This information was relayed to the detachment while Mr. Tessier was still at the station. The trial judge noted that the police knew there were tire tracks at the scene and what kind of truck Mr. Tessier drove (para. 50). But as Mr. Tessier argued before us, the trial judge made no mention that the police learned that the tire tracks matched the make of Mr. Tessier’s truck. Second, following the interview, a surveillance team was put in place to observe Mr. Tessier. Despite Cst. Van Steelandt’s testimony on this, the trial judge accepted Sgt. White’s statement that Mr. Tessier was not a suspect without addressing these points. The trial judge’s omission to consider the fact that the surveillance team had been put in place was also a palpable error in that it was a plain sign that suggests Mr. Tessier was suspected by police. In light of these two omissions, I am of the respectful view that the judge further underestimated the significance of the pointed questions posed by Sgt. White, including the direct suggestion that Mr. Tessier was culpably involved in the homicide, as a sign, viewed objectively, that Mr. Tessier was a suspect. These factual errors suggest strongly that the trial judge misapplied the objective test for determining whether Mr. Tessier was a suspect, or at least became a suspect, at the time of the interviews.

[62]                        These were palpable errors indicating that, as a matter of fact, Mr. Tessier was a suspect for the purposes of the confessions rule. But in my view, they did not prove to be overriding mistakes which would warrant appellate intervention (see Oickle, at para. 71). The trial judge continued, as an alternative and in the event that he was mistaken, to assess the circumstances as though Mr. Tessier were a suspect, and concluded that the absence of the caution would not have been fatal in this context. Even where a person is a suspect, the cases are clear that there is no bright‑line rule that a caution is required and that its absence renders a statement involuntary (Prosko v. The King (1922), 1922 CanLII 584 (SCC), 63 S.C.R. 226; Boudreau, at p. 267; Oickle, at paras. 47 and 71; Singh, at paras. 31‑33; see also R. v. Perry (1993), 1993 CanLII 5399 (NB CA), 140 N.B.R. (2d) 133 (C.A.), at para. 13; R. v. Peterson, 2013 MBCA 104, 299 Man. R. (2d) 236, at para. 52; Bottineau, at para. 88; R. v. Pearson, 2017 ONCA 389, 348 C.C.C. (3d) 277, at para. 31; R. v. Joseph, 2020 ONCA 73, 385 C.C.C. (3d) 514, at paras. 51‑56; Bernard v. R., 2019 QCCA 1227, at para. 29 (CanLII)). The trial judge noted that the failure to caution a suspect may, in the particular circumstances of a case, “effectively and unfairly deny the suspect the choice to speak” (para. 45, citing Morrison, at para. 57). He then turned his mind to the relevant Oickle factors and concluded that Mr. Tessier had not been treated oppressively, was allowed to leave unaccompanied, and voluntarily cooperated throughout, disclosing information selectively (paras. 45 and 51‑54). The Court of Appeal acknowledged that the trial judge did correctly point to evidence in support of his conclusion on voluntariness (para. 57). In other words, he asked whether Mr. Tessier had been unfairly denied his choice to speak in the event that he was a suspect, and concluded that, in the circumstances, he had not.

(d)         Conclusion

[63]                        In summary, while the trial judge was imprecise in some of his exposition of the law relating to the confessions rule, I am of the view that the Court of Appeal wrongly characterized these as errors of law and that, in themselves, these imprecisions had no material impact on the trial judge’s analysis. When his reasons are read as a whole, it is plain that the trial judge’s understanding of the law was not erroneous, even acknowledging that Mr. Tessier was likely a suspect. Given the trial judge’s palpable errors of fact, however, and the relevance to the analysis of the caution, it is necessary to apply the law afresh to explain why the judge’s errors are not overriding. I will return to that question after discussing the impact of the absence of a caution on voluntariness in the pre‑detention phase.

B.            In the Pre‑detention Phase of the Criminal Investigation, How Does the Absence of a Caution During Police Questioning of Mr. Tessier Affect the Voluntariness of His Statements?

[64]                        The cases draw together three threads fundamental to this issue. First, Charron J. advised that police should caution suspects during investigative questioning, but she stopped short of imposing a bright‑line rule. Second, the cases have long held that the absence of a caution is not determinative of voluntariness. Third, since Boudreau, it has nevertheless been acknowledged that the caution is an “important” factor (see, e.g., Bernard, at para. 29; see also Penney, Rondinelli and Stribopoulos, at ¶4.48). Tying these threads together calls for a consideration of how courts should treat the absence of a caution when measuring the voluntariness of statements made to the police.

[65]                        On this point, Mr. Tessier and one of the interveners assert that the police caution should be provided irrespective of whether a person is a witness or a suspect. As I have already explained, the law as it currently stands does not support this proposition. But Mr. Tessier also contends that the police caution is a necessary mechanism through which the informational deficit between police and citizen can be attenuated. This allows proper effect to be given to the fairness concerns that animate the confessions rule. The Crown accepts the important place of the caution, but emphasizes that only suspects and detainees are subject to the coercive power of the state in a manner that could prompt involuntary statements. Requiring a caution for all those subject to police questioning is unnecessary to protect the individuals concerned and would inhibit legitimate police investigation of crime. The voluntariness analysis should remain contextual and bright‑line rules imposing a caution to all individuals, at the expense of judicial discretion in the measure of voluntariness, should be avoided.

[66]                        The intervening attorneys general complement the Crown’s submissions. In a carefully written factum, the Attorney General of New Brunswick intervenes to urge this Court to reaffirm that the absence of a caution is but a single factor in the voluntariness analysis. It acknowledges that the absence of a caution raises fairness concerns but, it says, the weight given to its absence should operate on a spectrum. Greater weight should attach to that factor where a person is a suspect, but the absence of a caution should remain non‑determinative. The caution should be given to suspects only because their liberty is at greater risk than mere witnesses as persons who have been targeted in this way by the state. The Attorney General of New Brunswick proposes a suspect test which, it argues, provides a workable framework that will assist courts in applying the proper weight to the absence of a caution.

[67]                        To respond to these submissions, it is helpful to canvass why the case law has evolved in the manner it has. I will then endeavour to clarify how trial judges should consider the absence of a police caution as part of the contextual analysis for voluntariness set out in Oickle.

(1)         The Confessions Rule and Fairness

[68]                        The law relating to the modern confessions rule in Canada is settled. A confession will not be admissible if it is made under circumstances that raise a reasonable doubt as to voluntariness (Oickle, at para. 68). The Crown bears the persuasive or legal burden of proving voluntariness beyond a reasonable doubt. The inquiry is to be contextual and fact‑specific, requiring a trial judge to weigh the relevant factors of the particular case (Singh, at para. 35; R. v. Kelly, 2019 NLCA 23, 374 C.C.C. (3d) 360, at para. 40). It involves consideration of “the making of threats or promises, oppression, the operating mind doctrine and police trickery” (R. v. Spencer, 2007 SCC 11, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 12). These factors are not a checklist: ultimately, a trial judge must determine, based on the whole context of the case, whether the statements made by an accused were reliable and whether the conduct of the state served in any way to unfairly deprive the accused of their free choice to speak to a person in authority (Parent, at pp. 26‑27; Vauclair and Desjardins, at No. 38.28).

[69]                        This Court has repeatedly emphasized that the confessions rule, properly understood, strives for a balance between, on the one hand, the rights of the accused to remain silent and against self‑incrimination and, on the other, the legitimate law enforcement objectives of the state relating to the investigation of crime (Hebert, at pp. 176‑77 and 180; Oickle, at para. 33; Singh, at paras. 43 and 45). I would add that these interests, while they often appear in competition, share a common preoccupation in the repute of the administration of criminal justice which helps direct trial judges in finding the right point of equilibrium. Justice mandates a recognition that the rights of the accused are important but not without limit; it also insists that the police be given leeway in order to solve crimes but that their conduct not be unchecked. Indeed, achieving the right balance between these objectives involves seeking out this common ground and, in this sense, it has been usefully described as the “mission” of the confessions rule (D. M. Paciocco, P. Paciocco and L. Stuesser, The Law of Evidence (8th ed. 2020), at p. 425; see also Vauclair and Desjardins, at No. 38.23). In seeking this balance, the law imposes the heavy burden on the Crown to prove voluntariness beyond a reasonable doubt, which serves as substantial protection for the accused at all stages of a criminal investigation. Unlike the burden under the Charter, where the accused must establish a breach on a balance of probabilities, the confessions rule begins from a place of heightened protection for the accused because the rigorous task of showing voluntariness lies with the Crown.

[70]                        The rule is animated by both reliability and fairness concerns, and it operates differently depending on context. As Iacobucci J. explained in Oickle, while the doctrines of oppression and inducement are primarily concerned with reliability, other aspects of the confessions rule, such as the presence of threats or promises, the operating mind requirement, or police trickery, may all unfairly deny the accused’s right to silence (paras. 69‑71; Rothman v. The Queen, 1981 CanLII 23 (SCC), [1981] 1 S.C.R. 640, at pp. 682‑83 and 688, per Lamer J.; Hebert, at pp. 171‑73; Whittle, at p. 932; R. v. Hodgson, 1998 CanLII 798 (SCC), [1998] 2 S.C.R. 449, at paras. 21‑22; Singh, at para. 34). A statement may be excluded as involuntary because it is unreliable and raises the possibility of a false confession, or because it was unfairly obtained and ran afoul of the principle against self‑incrimination and the right to silence, whatever the context indicates. It may be excluded if it was extracted by police conduct [translation] “[that] is not in keeping with the socio‑moral values at the very foundation of the criminal justice system” (J. Fortin, Preuve pénale (1984), at No. 900).

[71]                        Even if reliability and fairness concerns are often tightly intertwined, the police caution is typically understood as speaking to fairness, as the case of Morrison, cited here by the trial judge, has emphasized. I agree with the Attorney General of New Brunswick that the lack of a police caution generally does very little to undermine the reliability of a statement. The mere fact that an individual was not cautioned does not in itself raise concerns that an unreliable confession or statement was provided. That said, in some situations a lack of a caution may exacerbate the pernicious influence of threats, inducements or oppression, which could contribute to undermining the reliability of a statement. In most cases, however, it speaks to fairness, in the sense that the absence of a caution may unfairly deprive someone of being able to make a free and meaningful choice to speak to police when, as a suspect, they are at a risk of legal jeopardy.

[72]                        But the caution does not resolve all of the concerns addressed by the confessions rule. The reason the absence of a caution is not determinative of voluntariness is because a caution is designed to rectify an informational imbalance when a detained or arrested individual is in a state of heightened vulnerability — which speaks to fairness — whereas voluntariness extends to a broader “complex of values” animated by both reliability and fairness (Oickle, at para. 70, citing J. H. Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law (Chadbourn rev. 1970), vol. 3, § 826, at p. 351). While there is no doubt that fairness, driven by the common law right to silence and privilege against self‑incrimination, plays an important role in the modern rule, the cases and the literature suggest it would be a mistake to allow it to dominate the analysis to the exclusion of other values (Boudreau, at pp. 269‑70; Oickle, at para. 47; Singh, at para. 35; S. Penney, “Theories of Confession Admissibility: A Historical View” (1998), 25 Am. J. Crim. L. 309, at pp. 373‑79; J. D. Grano, “Voluntariness, Free Will, and the Law of Confessions” (1979), 65 Va. L. Rev. 859, at p. 914). The confessions rule is also about protecting innocent defendants from false confessions and protecting suspects from abusive police tactics, which are distinct purposes reflected in their own ways in the threats or inducements, oppression and trickery factors. These concerns persist even where a caution has been properly delivered and understood. Contextual analysis is required to extend adequate protections to suspects beyond what the caution provides on its own, a point recognized in Boudreau.

[73]                        The rule in Boudreau has stood the test of time. In deciding that the absence of a caution is an important but not a decisive factor in the voluntariness inquiry, the Court confirmed that the confessions rule should remain flexible to account for the complex realities of police investigations. Rand J. appropriately observed that it would be a “serious error to place the ordinary modes of investigation of crime in a strait jacket of artificial rules” (p. 270). This approach has successfully allowed for a continued balance between societal interests in the investigation of crime and individual rights for many years, even as the Court’s understanding of the confessions rule has expanded to accommodate broader notions of fairness. Boudreau held that in Gach v. The King, 1943 CanLII 32 (SCC), [1943] S.C.R. 250, Taschereau J. was speaking in obiter when he stated that all confessions are inadmissible absent a proper caution. Gach was later criticized by Justice F. Kaufman of the Court of Appeal of Quebec, writing extrajudicially, who perceived it to misconstrue the law and “swe[ep] aside forty years of Canadian jurisprudence and establis[h] a rigidity hitherto unknown” (The Admissibility of Confessions (3rd ed. 1979), at p. 144).

[74]                        To make the absence of a police caution determinative of voluntariness would risk inhibiting legitimate investigative techniques while ignoring the other protections provided by the rule. As one author put it, “[t]o strive for equality of knowledge . . . is to strive to eliminate confessions” (Grano, at p. 914). The confessions rule accepts in its design that statements resulting from police questioning are valuable, provided they are reliable and fairly obtained (Hodgson, at para. 21; Singh, at para. 29; see also Penney (1998), at p. 378; Trotter, at p. 293). Even where a caution is not given, the circumstances may nevertheless indicate that a person has freely chosen to speak and no fairness concerns arise. Requiring a police caution as a condition of voluntariness would defeat the purposes of the rule and the balance it strives to achieve by imposing an inflexible standard of subjectively held knowledge for all individuals, whatever their status or role in an investigation. While the cases rightly speak of a balance, it bears recalling that the scales already tip in favour of protecting the rights of the accused by the broad scope of the rule and the heavy burden resting with the Crown. Moreover, the common law has hesitated to substitute a caution or waiver requirement of the right to silence for suspects who are questioned for the fact‑sensitive, contextual analysis in which the absence of a caution is an important, yet non‑determinative, factor. If such a requirement was thought to be necessary, Parliament could introduce legislation to that effect (see S. Penney, “Police Questioning in the Charter Era: Adjudicative versus Regulatory Rule-making and the Problem of False Confessions” (2012), 57 S.C.L.R. (2d) 263, at pp. 263‑64). In other contexts, for example the questioning of young persons, Parliament has done exactly that in recognition of their heightened vulnerability (see Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1, s. 146(2)).

[75]                        That said, there is no doubt that a caution can contribute to ensuring that an investigation is conducted fairly, especially where a suspect is detained and in a state more prone to making involuntary statements. In providing her guidance that a suspect should receive a caution, Charron J. in Singh was careful to note that a person’s situation changes after the moment of detention, which is why the caution is seen as necessary in those circumstances. As Charron J. explained, state authorities control the detainee who is in a more vulnerable position and cannot walk away. The fact of detention alone may cause a person to feel compelled to make a statement (para. 32; see Grant, at paras. 22 and 39; Hebert, at pp. 179‑80). The caution is required to attenuate the informational deficit in the face of heightened risk and vulnerability. Even if one acknowledges that many encounters with the police can be daunting, fairness considerations are unlikely to arise in the same way where the person is not suspected of being involved in the crime under investigation. Fairness concerns are manifest once an individual is targeted by the state. There is nothing inherently unfair, for instance, about police questioning a person standing on the street corner without providing a caution while gathering information regarding the potential witnessing of a crime.

[76]                        Yet in the specific context where a mere witness or an uninvolved individual is questioned, introducing a caution requirement as a condition of voluntariness could exact a cost on the administration of justice, notwithstanding the fact that no unfairness has arisen in obtaining the statement. Questioning at a police station is, to be sure, qualitatively different if the circumstances suggest that the interviewee brought or summoned for questioning is, on an objective basis, a suspect deserving of a caution. But to call for cautions in all circumstances would unnecessarily inhibit police work. Where a person faces no apparent legal jeopardy and the intentions of police are merely to gather information, an imposed caution could even chill investigations. Effective law enforcement is also highly dependent on the cooperation of members of the public (Grant, at para. 39). Where a contextual analysis reveals that no unfairness has arisen and no Charter protections were engaged, a bright‑line rule to caution everyone could disturb the balance struck by the confessions rule by excluding reliable and fairly‑obtained statements. It is preferable to allow courts to take measure of the true circumstances of the police encounter flexibly. In the spirit of Charron J.’s suggestion in Singh, courts should pay particular attention to whether the absence of a caution has had a material impact on voluntariness in a manner which would warrant exclusion of the statement.

[77]                        As a suspect who was not detained, Mr. Tessier’s circumstances lie between these extremes. Contrary to the Crown’s suggestion, there are fairness reasons why the caution may take on greater importance once a person becomes a suspect. A person in Mr. Tessier’s situation may also experience heightened vulnerability, but to a lesser degree than someone who, arrested and detained, is more fully under the control of the state. Speaking generally, a suspect who is not detained is free to leave. In some circumstances, notwithstanding the absence of a caution, a suspect may clearly know they do not have to answer questions or may be subject to no influences that would impugn voluntariness by way of threats or inducements, oppression, or police trickery. A suspect is not unfairly denied a free choice to speak in these circumstances. Conversely, even with an operating mind, conduct of the police may unfairly deny them that choice. All of this to say that the totality of the circumstances will be important in determining whether a statement made by a suspect who is not detained has been unfairly obtained.

(2)         Consequences of the Absence of a Caution

[78]                        I agree with the Attorney General of New Brunswick that the weight to be given to the absence of a caution will fall on a spectrum. At one end, the significance attached to the failure to caution an uninvolved individual — such as the person on the street corner — will typically be negligible. The relative lack of vulnerability of an uninvolved individual or witness who is questioned by police means that a caution will typically be unnecessary to show that the statements were voluntary. To require that police caution every person to whom they address questions in a criminal investigation, even where those questions are asked at a police station, would be — as the Court of Appeal rightly noted here — an unworkable standard. It would unduly limit the broader societal interest in investigating crime by excluding reliable and fairly obtained statements in circumstances that do not warrant it.

[79]                        At the other end of the spectrum, the vulnerability and legal jeopardy faced by detainees cement the need for a police caution. Fairness commands that they know of their right to counsel and, by extension, of their right to remain silent so that they can make an “informed choice” whether or not to participate in the investigation (I borrow the expression “informed choice” from Singh, at para. 33). The balance courts seek to achieve in applying the confessions rule in this context tilts in favour of protecting the rights of the detained person and of limiting society’s interest in the investigation of crime. The weight attached to the absence of a caution in these circumstances, while not determinative of the question of voluntariness owing to the contextual analysis required, will be at the highest end (see Singh, at para. 33).

[80]                        In circumstances in between, where police interview a suspect who is not detained and do not provide a caution, I agree with the longstanding view that the lack of caution is not fatal, but that it is an important factor in determining voluntariness (see generally Kaufman, at pp. 142‑46). The importance attached to the absence of a caution will also be significant in recognition of the potential for vulnerability and exploitation of an informational deficit, unless it can be demonstrated in the circumstances, as I will explain in more detail below, that there is no doubt as to its voluntariness. This builds incrementally on Charron J.’s helpful reasons on this point in Singh. The heightened jeopardy and consequential vulnerability faced by a suspect, as opposed to an uninvolved individual, warrants special consideration in the final analysis to ensure adequate and principled protections under the confessions rule. Although encounters between police and citizens sometimes mean the status of a person may change over the course of an interview, investigators are well accustomed to signs that raise their suspicions. This would be the proper moment to caution the interviewee to prevent the potential exclusion of the statement at trial.

[81]                        The first step in assessing the importance of the absence of a police caution is therefore to identify whether or not the person was a suspect. I would endorse the suggestion of the Attorney General of New Brunswick that fairness considerations may arise where a person is a suspect, and that a suspect test is a useful way of determining whether an accused person may have been unfairly denied their right to silence (see Oland, at para. 42; Smyth, at p. 34, citing Boudreau). This is also consistent with statements from this Court that “the confessions rule applies whenever a person in authority questions a suspect” (Oickle, at para. 30). The test is as proposed by the Attorney General of New Brunswick: whether there were objectively discernable facts known to the interviewing officer at the time of the interview which would lead a reasonably competent investigator to conclude that the interviewee is implicated in the criminal offence being investigated (see Morrison, at para. 50; Oland, at paras. 43‑46; Smyth, at pp. 34‑36; Wong, at para. 64; Merritt, at para. 39; Higham, at paras. 5‑7).

[82]                        The test is objective, and includes both an assessment of the objectively discernable facts known at the time and the interaction between police and the interviewee. Pointed questions, particularly where they suggest the culpable involvement of the individual being questioned, may indicate that the person is a suspect, but pointed questions may have other legitimate ends, depending on the circumstances. A trial judge is best positioned to determine whether the police were simply seeking to gauge a person’s reaction to certain lines of questioning, or whether the questioning is more consistent with the interrogation of a true suspect. While the fact that the police initiated the interview does not, on its own, indicate that a person is a suspect, it may serve as a sign that a person was a suspect where combined with other indications. That said, questions that provoke anxiety or discomfort or even imply guilt do not necessarily mean a person is a suspect. The nature of the interaction between police and the individual and its connection to the objectively verifiable facts is therefore relevant to the suspect test.

[83]                        Once a court reaches the conclusion that a person was a suspect, the absence of a police caution is not merely one factor among others to be considered. Rather, it is prima facie evidence of an unfair denial of the choice to speak to police, and courts must explicitly address whether the failure created an unfairness in the circumstances (see Oland, at para. 42). It cannot be washed aside in the sea of other considerations. Instead, it serves to impugn the fairness of the statement and must be addressed, by the Crown, in the constellation of circumstances relevant to whether the accused made a free choice to speak. In discharging its burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a statement was voluntary, the Crown will need to overcome this prima facie evidence of unfairness.

[84]                        This adjustment should be understood in light of the allocation of the evidential and persuasive burdens of proof which, for the operating mind test, is explained as follows by authors Lederman, Fuerst and Stewart, at ¶8.119, citing Ward, at p. 41, and R. v. Lapointe and Sicotte (1983), 1983 CanLII 3558 (ON CA), 9 C.C.C. (3d) 366 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 383, aff’d 1987 CanLII 69 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1253:

A final consideration under the operating mind test is the allocation of the evidential burden and [the] persuasive (legal) burdens of proof. Inasmuch as the accused may be the only person who has knowledge of these subjective matters, the evidentiary burden to adduce sufficient evidence to raise the issue should be allocated to the accused. . . . Once the accused has adduced sufficient evidence to make it a live issue, the Crown must then satisfy the trial judge beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement was voluntary.

[85]                        Extrapolating from this useful insight and broadening its application to beyond the operating mind context, and in keeping with Charron J.’s advice on cautions in Singh, I propose to recognize that the absence of a caution to a suspect constitutes prima facie evidence that an accused was unfairly denied their choice to speak to the police. This is sufficient to render the absence of a caution a live issue that the Crown must dispel in order to establish the voluntary character of the statement beyond reasonable doubt.

(3)         Legal Framework

[86]                        In the course of cross‑examination of police witnesses or upon hearing the accused’s own testimony, it may come to light that the accused was in a situation of heightened vulnerability and risk, either because they were detained or a suspect, and were not given a caution despite being suspected of a crime. That is sufficient to cast doubt on whether the interviewee spoke voluntarily as understood in Whittle and Oickle; that is, that the accused had the ability to understand what was being said and that it may be used in evidence, and that there was no other recognized consideration impugning voluntariness. The accused thus has met their evidentiary burden to make the absence of a caution a “live issue”; in keeping with its persuasive burden, the Crown must then satisfy the trial judge beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement was nevertheless voluntary.

[87]                        In these circumstances, it is appropriate for the trier of fact to undertake a contextual inquiry to determine whether an unfairness arose that vitiates voluntariness by denying the right to silence. This might arise where there is evidence of police trickery, for example circumstances in which the absence of a caution is the result of a willful failure to give a caution or a deliberate tactic to manipulate the suspect into thinking they have nothing at stake (see, e.g., R. v. Crawford, 1995 CanLII 138 (SCC), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 858, at para. 25; R. v. Auclair (2004), 2004 CanLII 24201 (QC CA), 183 C.C.C. (3d) 273 (Que. C.A.), at para. 41; M. (D.), at para. 45; Higham, at para. 22). Impropriety on the part of the police, usually in the form of obscuring the jeopardy faced by the suspect to encourage cooperation, may unfairly deny a suspect their right to silence. Plainly, the statement should be excluded if the police deception shocks the community. But even if it does not rise to that level, deceiving the interviewee into thinking that, as a mere witness, they are in no jeopardy and that their statements will not be used in evidence against them could preclude admissibility at the end of the day. “[T]he ability to make a meaningful choice remains pertinent where trickery is involved”, write Lederman, Fuerst and Stewart, “and exclusion is mandated where there is a reasonable doubt as to the confession’s voluntariness in this regard” (¶8.126). I would note there is a distinction between misleading a person about the extent of their jeopardy and declining to inform a person that they are a suspect. Police need not provide details about the status of their investigation provided the salient information is communicated and there are no strategies of deception (R. v. Campbell, 2018 ONCA 837, 366 C.C.C. (3d) 346, at paras. 8‑9).

[88]                        While not necessary for the Crown to demonstrate, proof that the accused was in fact subjectively aware of their right to silence or aware of the consequences of speaking will be powerful evidence that the absence of a caution did not undermine voluntariness. In such an instance, doubts as to fairness that could result from the absence of a caution plainly do not arise because the suspect has the information necessary to choose whether to speak or remain silent. For example, in the cases of Pepping, R. v. Boothe, 2016 ONCA 987, and R. v. Blackmore, 2017 BCSC 2682, cited by the Court of Appeal, the statements were held to be voluntary despite the absence of a caution. In each of these cases, the court was satisfied that the suspect was aware of the consequences of speaking. Stated non‑exhaustively, indications that a suspect may be aware of the right to silence or the consequences of speaking include awareness of being recorded (R. v. Leblanc (2001), 2001 CanLII 12528 (QC CA), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 74 (Que. C.A.), at para. 17), indications that the suspect is directing conversation (Boothe, at para. 20 (CanLII)), awareness of what the police are investigating and the suspect’s alleged role in the investigation (M. (D.), at para. 45; Leblanc, at para. 26), and exercising the right to silence by declining to answer police questions (M. (D.), at para. 46). I would underscore that these cases do not stand for the proposition that the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt subjective knowledge of the right to silence or that the proof of knowledge displaces the settled test for an operating mind. Rather, they indicate that where there is evidence that the accused was aware of their right to silence or of the consequences of speaking, the weight attached to the absence of a caution becomes less important because there are other strong indications of voluntariness. An eagerness to talk, as in the case of Pepping (at para. 6), may or may not serve as evidence of voluntariness, depending on the circumstances. A person may appear eager to talk as a result of either a genuine interest in doing so or through a feeling of fear and compulsion.

(4)         Summary

[89]                        In summary, the confessions rule always places the ultimate burden on the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a statement made by an accused to a person in authority was made voluntarily. When an accused brings a voluntariness claim with respect to police questioning that did not include a caution, the first step is to determine whether or not the accused was a suspect. If the accused was a suspect, the absence of a caution is prima facie evidence of an unfair denial of choice but not dispositive of the matter. It is credible evidence of a lack of voluntariness that must be addressed by the court directly. Depending on the circumstances, it is potentially relevant to different Oickle factors as well as any other considerations pertinent to voluntariness. However, the absence of a caution is not conclusive and the Crown may still discharge its burden, if the totality of the circumstances allow. The Crown need not prove that the accused subjectively understood the right to silence and the consequences of speaking, but, where it can, this will generally prove to be persuasive evidence of voluntariness. If the circumstances indicate that there was an informational deficit exploited by police, this will weigh heavily towards a finding of involuntariness. But if the Crown can prove that the suspect maintained their ability to exercise a free choice because there were no signs of threats or inducements, oppression, lack of an operating mind or police trickery, that will be sufficient to discharge the Crown’s burden that the statement was voluntary and remove the stain brought by the failure to give a caution.

(5)         Application to the Facts

[90]                        In light of the foregoing, and given the absence of a caution, were Mr. Tessier’s statements to the police voluntary under the confessions rule? I agree with the trial judge’s conclusion that the statements are admissible: Mr. Tessier did exercise a free or meaningful choice to speak to Sgt. White and he was not unfairly denied his right to silence. This is so even taking Mr. Tessier’s argument at its highest by accepting that he was a suspect. I shall assume that Charron J.’s recommendation applies here: Sgt. White should have cautioned Mr. Tessier at the outset of the interview. Given that there was a reasonable basis to consider Mr. Tessier a suspect and in light of the pointed questioning he faced, which was adversarial in nature, the absence of the caution raises prima facie proof that, on its own, satisfies the evidentiary burden that the Crown must address in its legal burden of proving voluntariness. But I am satisfied that the record substantiates the Crown’s argument, accepted by the trial judge, that Mr. Tessier had an operating mind and was not otherwise tricked in the circumstances. There are more decisive indications of voluntariness here, including circumstances that go above and beyond the basic requirements of an operating mind. The record contains strong signs, each of which points to the fact that Mr. Tessier was well aware of the consequences of speaking to Sgt. White. He knew that anything he said could be used as evidence, and knew that he had a choice between alternatives as to whether or not to cooperate with police. Additionally, while undoubtedly pointed at times, Sgt. White was forthright in the manner in which he confronted Mr. Tessier. The accused exercised a free choice to speak in the circumstances.

[91]                        Informed that he was being recorded, Mr. Tessier began the interview anxious to convey information that would lead Sgt. White’s suspicions elsewhere. In particular, he noted at the outset that Mr. Berdahl’s ex‑girlfriend “hate[d]” him, that Mr. Berdahl owes a lot of people money, and that when he heard Mr. Berdahl had been involved in a homicide, he thought Mr. Berdahl had been culpably involved. Referring to when police first contacted him about their investigation, Mr. Tessier said the following to Sgt. White:

And at first I thought he did something. Um, you know, it was like uh what did he do now? kind of thing, like uh cause he does work as a bouncer for some of the strippers and that. And he – he’s – he’s done that kind of stuff before. Bodyguard whatever. Like he does all the side jobs, you know. . . . [S]o I thought maybe he’s you know stabbed somebody or whatever else, you know, cause he’s always got his knives on him, he’s always got, you know well he’s got – he usually has a lot of weapons and stuff on him so uh I’m wondering if he did something that way.

 

(A.R., vol. IV, at p. 109)

[92]                        Mr. Tessier clearly knew that anything he said could be used as evidence. Not only was he advised at the start of the interview that it was being recorded, he made inquiries to ensure the recording was still live. He was told at times to speak up for the purposes of the recording. The obvious inference is that Mr. Tessier was aware that police were recording his statement for investigatory purposes related to the homicide of Mr. Berdahl. The trial judge took note of this (at para. 10); the Court of Appeal made no mention of Mr. Tessier’s awareness that the interview was being recorded and his expression of interest that his narrative was being caught on tape — an indication that he knew what police were investigating and what was at stake. To revert to the operating mind test in Whittle, Mr. Tessier not only had the ability to understand what he was saying but also to comprehend that the evidence may be used as evidence in criminal proceedings. Importantly, as was the case for the interviewee in Pepping, Mr. Tessier understood that the police officer was recording his statement and he sought to ensure that his own version of events would be part of that record.

[93]                        Mr. Tessier even made positive assertions that he would not cooperate, an indication that he knew his cooperation was voluntary and that when he spoke it reflected a choice between alternatives. After returning from his cigarette break outside the detachment where he freely conversed with his friend, and after Sgt. White confirmed the time for the purpose of the recording, Mr. Tessier then declined to provide his DNA sample, stating the following:

No, I’ll state right now. Um, I – I don’t know what’s going on. I don’t want to be painted into a corner. . . . I – I don’t want to be put in a position where I – I’m like the – the one guy that you guys have or something like that . . . Like uh if my hair is on him or something like that, I don’t want to be [the] murder[er]. I don’t want to be charged with anything like that.

 

(A.R., vol. IV, at p. 130)

[94]                        At other moments, there are indications that Mr. Tessier was attempting to craft an image of concern and selective cooperation, while attempting to find out what police knew. Early on in the exchange, he invited Sgt. White to ask questions about Mr. Berdahl, seemingly confident in the information he could provide. On several occasions Mr. Tessier inquired into what happened to Mr. Berdahl. He invited police to his home to sort through Mr. Berdahl’s possessions. These interactions suggest that Mr. Tessier was well aware that police were investigating the homicide of Mr. Berdahl and that anything he said could be used as evidence, an awareness that he unambiguously displayed when he said to Sgt. White, “I’m the only person that you guys got and that’s not good” (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 130). The exchanges also show an eagerness to talk and a perceived confidence in his ability to control the information provided to Sgt. White, further indications, when the whole of the context is considered, of the voluntariness of his statements.

[95]                        While he was not told that he was a suspect, Mr. Tessier was not misled about his jeopardy. It was clear from the beginning that he had not been eliminated from the investigation, a point made directly by Sgt. White when he explained the purpose for requesting the DNA sample. If there was any doubt that Mr. Tessier was facing the potential jeopardy of a murder charge, this was dispelled when Sgt. White asked directly if he had killed Mr. Berdahl. It was also known to Mr. Tessier:

Q: What do you think should happen to the person that uh caused his – his death?

A: He should be charged.

 

Q: For?

A: Murder, apparently.

 

(A.R., vol. IV, at p. 125)

[96]                        In other words, Mr. Tessier was aware that the police might pursue him in a criminal investigation, and he sought to avoid that outcome by managing the information he conveyed to Sgt. White. Again, the facts are comparable with those in Pepping. In that case, police did not caution the accused before interviewing him. The trial judge had found that that the accused was not a suspect and that his statements were voluntary. The Court of Appeal reviewed the record and found reasonable support for voluntariness, even if the accused was a suspect. On the application of Singh, the question was whether the absence of a caution rendered the statement involuntary. The Court of Appeal held that the record supported the findings that the accused was eager to talk and aware of the legal consequences of giving a statement, and accordingly the court deferred to the trial judge. As in that case, Mr. Tessier was eager to speak with Sgt. White, sought to ensure that his statement was being recorded, and took proactive steps to decline to cooperate when it suited him.

[97]                        The record makes plain that the trial judge’s conclusion that Mr. Tessier had an operating mind should not be disturbed on appeal. He knew that his statements to police could be used as evidence in criminal proceedings, and the absence of a caution did not give rise to an informational deficit that was unfairly exploited by Sgt. White. His choice to speak to the police was a free or meaningful choice.

[98]                        As the voluntariness inquiry is broader than just the operating mind doctrine, it is appropriate to consider whether there were any threats or inducements, oppressive tactics, or police trickery that would cast doubt on the voluntariness of Mr. Tessier’s statements. I note that Mr. Tessier does not argue that he was in some way threatened, tricked, or treated oppressively. At its highest, Mr. Tessier’s claim is that Sgt. White unfairly exploited an informational deficit, in particular through his pointed questions, and should have cautioned him. I have already described why that does not describe the circumstances of this case or decide the question. Nevertheless, other indications that Mr. Tessier’s statements were voluntary suggest that there was nothing unfair about the methods Sgt. White used to interview him.

[99]                        Mr. Tessier was indeed nervous when confronted with Sgt. White’s pointed questions. Sgt. White testified that he was attempting to get a “read” on Mr. Tessier to see if he would say anything inculpatory (A.R., vol. II, at p. 35). Generally, questioning contributes to an atmosphere of oppression where it is excessively aggressive and intimidating over a prolonged period (Oickle, at para. 60). While the trial judge did not take adequate account of the adversarial nature of the questioning in his evaluation of the status of Mr. Tessier as a suspect, the questioning did not contribute to an atmosphere of oppression in the manner contemplated in Oickle. Nor did the fact that the interview occurred at the station create an atmosphere of oppression. To be perfectly plain: the facts here are very different from other interrogation cases where a person was subjected to a lengthy and vigorous interrogation and was unable to leave the interview room, or was deprived of sleep or nourishment over the course of the interview. None of that occurred here.

[100]                     The trial judge was not mistaken in concluding that Sgt. White did not engage in police trickery that was “so appalling as to shock the community” (Oickle, at para. 67). There is no suggestion here that Sgt. White engaged in even a lesser form of trickery by misleading Mr. Tessier about his jeopardy to encourage cooperation. Sgt. White confronted Mr. Tessier in a forthright manner. It was clear he was investigating the death of Mr. Berdahl. He presented Mr. Tessier with real information, noting, for example, that it was suspicious that Mr. Tessier was the last person in the company of Mr. Berdahl before he was found dead. His queries about whether Mr. Tessier was driving and flicking cigarettes near Carstairs was motivated by the genuine discovery of cigarettes within the vicinity of the body. It was no secret that Mr. Berdahl owed Mr. Tessier money — Mr. Tessier said so himself at the beginning of the interview. It is true that he did not share all the information he had about the tire tracks and the footprints at the scene of the crime with Mr. Tessier, but he did not hide his interest in either the kind of vehicle Mr. Tessier drove or the kind of shoes he wore.

[101]                     It is best to acknowledge that Mr. Tessier’s jeopardy was at its highest at the end of the first interview, at which point the RCMP put together a surveillance team to observe Mr. Tessier, and that the trial judge did not record this fact in his reasons. And yet it bears recalling that it was during this period of increased jeopardy that Mr. Tessier conclusively showed his statements after the first interview to be voluntary: he repeatedly called Sgt. White and re‑attended the detachment in person to look for him. That Mr. Tessier actively sought out Sgt. White to bring him to his home to check if his gun was in its case is an overriding indicator of voluntariness with respect to his statements after the first interview. It also provides general context consistent with his other efforts to cooperate and disclose information selectively.

[102]                     The voluntariness issue in this case is about fairness. Mr. Tessier did not argue that any of the statements made to Sgt. White were inaccurate. No reliability concerns arise. Rather, the case is about whether Mr. Tessier was treated unfairly by police such that he was denied a meaningful choice to speak to them. Nothing about the circumstances of his statements suggests this. Mr. Tessier was well aware of the nature of the investigation and sought to manage the information conveyed to Sgt. White in a manner that suited him. There were no threats or police tricks, nor was there an atmosphere of oppression. Accepting that he erred in deciding that Mr. Tessier was not a suspect during the interviews of March 17, 2007, the trial judge’s conclusions that Mr. Tessier’s statements were voluntary and that he exercised a free choice to speak should not be disturbed.

C.            Was Mr. Tessier Psychologically Detained, and, if so, What Impact Did That Have on the Admissibility of His Statements?

[103]                     Mr. Tessier recalls that, in the circumstances of this case, he was questioned at a police station following a request by a person in authority that he present himself there. He says that he was more than a suspect; he was psychologically detained by Sgt. White such that the failure to inform him of the right to obtain and instruct counsel without delay constituted a breach under s. 10(b) of the Charter. Further, he argues that the statements gathered during the first and second interviews should have been excluded from the evidence under s. 24(2) of the Charter.

[104]                     Mr. Tessier submits that the trial judge distilled the wrong factors to guide his detention analysis, relying improperly on considerations identified in R. v. Moran (1987), 1987 CanLII 124 (ON CA), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.), and restated in R. v. Seagull, 2015 BCCA 164, 323 C.C.C. (3d) 361. Mr. Tessier argues that on a proper application of Grant and R. v. Le, 2019 SCC 34, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 692, he was psychologically detained. The Court of Appeal noted it was not necessarily an error to rely on the factors in Moran and Seagull, so long as full consideration was given to the Grant factors to answer the ultimate question of detention.

[105]                     The psychological detention question in this case is governed by the three factors discussed in Grant and affirmed in Le. Psychological detention exists where an individual is legally required to comply with a direction or demand by the police, or where “a reasonable person in [that individual’s] position would feel so obligated” and would “conclude that he or she was not free to go” (Grant, at paras. 30‑31; Le, at para. 25; Parent, at pp. 460‑61). Three factors are to be considered and balanced in determining whether a person has been psychologically detained: first, the circumstances giving rise to the encounter as they would reasonably be perceived by the individual; second, the nature of the police conduct; and third, the particular characteristics or circumstances of the individual where relevant (Grant, at para. 44; Le, at para. 31).

[106]                     Applying these factors, I would reject Mr. Tessier’s claim that he was psychologically detained and confirm the trial judge’s conclusion on this point.

[107]                     All three Grant factors weigh against finding that Mr. Tessier was detained. The initial contact was in the form of a general inquiry, and Mr. Tessier would not have felt singled out for a focussed investigation given that he knew others were being interviewed as well. Mr. Tessier attended the detachment through his own means. Although the situation changed when Sgt. White asked a series of pointed questions that suggested police thought Mr. Tessier was culpably involved, a reasonable person in his shoes would not have felt obliged to comply in the circumstances. Mr. Tessier was aware that police were investigating the homicide of his friend and, when challenged, he provided an exculpatory narrative and sought to direct suspicions elsewhere. At no point did Sgt. White state or imply that Mr. Tessier would not be free to go. Instead, after denying his involvement, Mr. Tessier used that moment to relieve the increased pressure on him by going outside for a smoke. Mr. Tessier clearly possessed the agency to leave the interview room and, crucially, he declined to cooperate with the DNA sample upon his return after consulting with his friend.

[108]                     The fact that the interview took place at the police station does not on its own give rise to a detention (Parent, at pp. 476‑77; see also R. v. Pomeroy, 2008 ONCA 521, 91 O.R. (3d) 261; R. v. Hawkins, 1993 CanLII 140 (SCC), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 157, rev’g (1992), 1992 CanLII 7125 (NL CA), 102 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 91 (N.L.C.A.)). The contextual inquiry mandated by Grant and Le requires the totality of the circumstances to be examined. Mr. Tessier’s attendance at the detachment was requested, not demanded. Sgt. White’s relaxed manner of dress and permissive attitude to Mr. Tessier’s movements would have lessened a sense that compliance was mandatory. The interview ended in a cordial manner, with Mr. Tessier inviting officers to his home and choosing to hitch a ride back to his vehicle with Sgt. White.

[109]                     Even if he was observed, Mr. Tessier was permitted to leave the detachment unattended. Mr. Tessier exhibited no particular vulnerabilities that would suggest that the reasonable person would have felt compelled to comply with demands or directions from the police. At the time of the questioning, he was a mature adult who demonstrated keen awareness of his position in relation to police.

[110]                     With respect to his interactions with police after the first interview, it is significant that Mr. Tessier repeatedly called Sgt. White and attended the RCMP detachment of his own volition and on his own terms. Mr. Tessier was initiating contact and could not plausibly claim to feel detained when he returned to the RCMP detachment and accompanied officers to his house.

[111]                     Given that Mr. Tessier was not psychologically detained, his Charter rights were not triggered. There was no breach of his right to counsel. I would confirm the trial judge’s conclusion on this issue.

VI.         Conclusion

[112]                     For the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the conviction ordered at trial.

 

                  The following are the reasons delivered by

 

                    Brown and Martin JJ. —

I.               Overview

[113]                     In the early stages of a murder investigation, the RCMP discovered that Mr. Tessier was a close friend of the deceased. They asked him to come to the police station for an interview. He did so, and his statements during that interview were audio and video recorded. During what can only be described as a focused, targeted interrogation, the investigating officer:

•           asked Mr. Tessier if he killed the victim,

•           asked Mr. Tessier how he could disprove having killed the victim,

•           asked Mr. Tessier why his DNA would be near the crime scene,

•           suggested to Mr. Tessier that he was lying, and

•           invited him to incriminate himself by providing physical evidence.

At no point did police warn Mr. Tessier that he was not obliged to speak with them or that anything he said could be used in evidence.

[114]                     Although Mr. Tessier said that his statements to the police were made involuntarily, the trial judge admitted them and convicted Mr. Tessier of first degree murder. He erroneously found that, because the officer did not perceive Mr. Tessier as a suspect, his failure to warn Mr. Tessier about his right to remain silent and the consequences of speaking to police did not impact the voluntariness of his statements. The Court of Appeal of Alberta set aside Mr. Tessier’s conviction and ordered a new trial. Specifically, it held that the trial judge erred in ruling the statements voluntary since, where no such warning had been given, he must have first considered whether the accused understood he did not have to say anything and that anything he said could be used against him (2020 ABCA 289, 12 Alta. L.R. (7th) 55, at paras. 37 and 56).

[115]                     Mr. Tessier says he was detained. We agree entirely with the majority’s account of the law governing that issue, including the substance of Mr. Tessier’s burden. While it is unnecessary for us to decide whether Mr. Tessier has met that burden, it is not obvious to us that he has. In any event, we are content to decide this case on the trial judge’s erroneous treatment of the confessions rule. Specifically, we agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial judge’s reasons reflect “an impoverished understanding of the modern confessions rule” (para. 46). In the trial judge’s view, it was sufficient that Mr. Tessier had basic cognitive capacity and the police did not threaten, trick, or induce him into making a statement. His reasoning follows a troubling trend since this Court’s decision in R. v. Oickle, 2000 SCC 38, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 3, whereby the four common factors identified in Oickle as vitiating voluntariness are misused as a checklist to satisfy the Crown’s burden.

[116]                     The majority rightly affirms that the Oickle factors are not a checklist (para. 68). Kasirer J. further recognizes that voluntariness protects the right of suspects to freely and effectively choose to speak to police (paras. 4, 9 and 71). As a result, the majority introduces a salutary change to the law: the absence of a warning in this circumstance is “prima facie evidence that [suspects] were unfairly denied their choice to speak to the police” (para. 9; see also paras. 83 and 89). We therefore understand the majority to adopt a presumption of inadmissibility when statements are elicited from suspects without a warning. The rationale underlying the majority’s presumption is that the absence of a caution may unfairly deprive individuals of making a “free and meaningful choice to speak to police” when they are at “risk of legal jeopardy” (para. 71).

[117]                     While we agree with these statements, in our view, the majority falls short by failing to carry this same rationale to its logical conclusion: that is, in order to ensure that individuals are making a “free and meaningful choice to speak to police”, police should provide a warning at the outset of all interviews — and not just interviews of suspects. In our view, any interview conducted without a warning is presumptively involuntary, and the presumption should be more difficult to rebut where the interviewee’s risk of self-incrimination was objectively heightened.

[118]                     In our view, such a rule follows from our jurisprudence, which has progressed beyond a negative inquiry into police inducements, trickery, and oppression. Since at least this Court’s decision in R. v. Hebert, 1990 CanLII 118 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151, confirmed more recently in R. v. Singh, 2007 SCC 48, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 405, it has been clear that voluntariness exists only where the accused made a meaningful choice to speak with police. An individual’s statement to police must therefore reflect a “genuine desire to confess” (H. Stewart, “The Confessions Rule and the Charter” (2009), 54 McGill L.J. 517, at p. 522). A meaningful choice is an informed choice. Interviewees cannot make a meaningful choice without knowing that the choice is between speaking and not speaking with police, and of the consequences of choosing to speak. Voluntariness is premised on the assumption that the interviewee should have actual knowledge of the legally available options. So understood, that meaningful choice arises at the moment police begin to question an individual; its protection is not confined to detainees or suspects.

[119]                     We stress that it cannot merely be assumed that people interacting with the police know that they may remain silent and that whatever they say can be used in evidence. Indeed, the police officer in this case got the rule wrong himself when he (much later) told Mr. Tessier that only statements made after he was formally read his rights and Charter cautioned could be used against him.

[120]                     In sum, and unlike our colleagues, we would not limit the importance of a warning to circumstances where an accused is a suspect or detainee. A warning should be given at the outset of all interviews, and its importance increases with the objective risk of self-incrimination. Specifically, when the police initiate contact with a person to secure information about a crime they are investigating, a rebuttable presumption arises whereby any statement given in the absence of a warning is involuntary. The Crown may rebut the presumption by establishing, based on some other objective source of information, that interviewees otherwise knew they had a right to remain silent and that anything they said could be used in evidence. The presumption will be more difficult to rebut where the risk of self-incrimination is objectively heightened, for instance, when a person is invited to conduct a recorded interview at the police station, when the police take an adversarial approach during an interview, or when there is information that, objectively viewed, would raise a reasonable suspicion that the individual was involved in the crime. That is true whether or not the investigating officer subjectively views the individual being questioned as a witness, suspect, or detainee.

[121]                     A warning — one simple sentence — by the authorities at the outset of an interview — that the person is not obliged to say anything, but that anything said can be used in evidence, sets the necessary foundation for voluntariness and enhances the fairness of the process. Replacing the dubious assumption of universal knowledge with a simple and direct communication corrects any informational asymmetry to the benefit of all concerned.

[122]                     First, interviewees, having been informed of their choice, understand that they may lawfully remain silent.

[123]                     Secondly, police are given a clear, bright-line rule which does not rely on a cumbersome framework directing them to consider the perceived status of the interviewee at any particular point in time. Interviews are so dynamic and fluid that it has proven exceedingly difficult to pinpoint with any confidence when an interviewee becomes a potential suspect, a person of interest, a real suspect, or a detainee. Providing basic and necessary information from the outset, which is when the voluntariness requirement arises, allows authorities to proceed without fear that an interviewee’s misunderstanding about whether to speak or not will result in their carefully conducted interviews yielding involuntary (and therefore inadmissible) statements.

[124]                     Finally, it follows that the Crown will benefit from such information having been given to the accused at the outset, since it can therefore more easily establish the meaningful choice at the heart of the voluntariness inquiry.

[125]                     Our approach promotes the confessions rule’s animating concern with fairness and the administration of justice. It provides a strong incentive for police to warn individuals before questioning them, and helps alleviate the informational deficit and coercive element inherent in police interrogations. Contrary to the Crown’s submissions and the majority’s reasons, it will not unduly interfere with police investigations. Nor can we endorse an approach that effectively invites police to exploit the murky lines around psychological detention and rely on individuals’ ignorance of their rights to extract statements where they are at risk of incriminating themselves.

[126]                     Applying our restated test, the question in this case becomes whether Mr. Tessier spoke to police voluntarily with awareness about what was at stake. In our view, he did not. When the police contacted him to secure information in relation to their homicide investigation, he was not initially informed that he was not required to speak to police and that what he said could be used as evidence. Further, both the officer’s adversarial questioning and the information pointing to Mr. Tessier as a suspect increased his objective risk of self-incrimination. As the majority acknowledges (at para. 61), the trial judge committed palpable errors by ignoring key information that would have raised a reasonable suspicion that Mr. Tessier committed the crime. The Crown failed to rebut the presumption of involuntariness, and the statements should not have been admitted. We would therefore dismiss the appeal and confirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal setting aside the conviction and ordering a new trial.

II.            Background

[127]                     On March 16, 2007, Allan Berdahl’s body was found in a ditch alongside a remote road near Carstairs, Alberta. He had died from gunshot wounds to the head. Officers observed one set of tire tracks, two sets of footprints, and blood spatter in undisturbed snow around the body. Two cigarette butts and a single .22 calibre bullet were later located near the scene.

[128]                     The police quickly learned that Mr. Tessier was a friend and business associate of Mr. Berdahl. They asked Mr. Tessier for an interview, and he attended the RCMP detachment in Didsbury to be interviewed by Sgt. White, a veteran investigator. The interview was audio and video recorded. The door of the interview room was closed but not locked.

[129]                     When the interview began, Mr. Tessier told the officer he was “nervous as hell” (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 98). Sgt. White noticed that Mr. Tessier appeared nervous and his hands were shaking. Sgt. White explained that police were investigating a homicide and began with background questions. Mr. Tessier described an afternoon and evening with the deceased the day before his body was discovered, and said that he last saw Mr. Berdahl around 8 p.m.

[130]                     At that point, Sgt. White suggested that Mr. Tessier was “[p]retty mixed up” or “bothered”, and there was “only one reason for that”, so he should “[t]ell the truth” (p. 117). He remarked that Mr. Tessier’s presence in Didsbury, near the location of the body, was “[p]retty coincidental” and “if you cross[ed] all the little lines, what does [that] look like?” (pp. 109-10). Telling Mr. Tessier: “. . . you hold the truth as far as I’m concerned . . .”, he explained that the police typically look to people that know the victim and Mr. Tessier was “one of his best friends” and “the last person with him” (pp. 120-21 and 127).

[131]                     Sgt. White went on to ask several pointed questions: Was there any reason his DNA might be near the crime scene?; what should happen to the person who caused the death?; “[d]id you think it was planned?”; “[d]id you kill Allan Berdahl?”; and “how can you prove to me that you didn’t do it”? (pp. 126-27). Mr. Tessier said he was “scared to answer questions” and he did not know what to do (p. 126).

[132]                     Next, Sgt. White began collecting physical evidence from Mr. Tessier. First, he asked Mr. Tessier to provide a DNA sample so the police could use it to “eliminate” his DNA being at the crime scene. Mr. Tessier replied, “Why wouldn’t I?” (p. 129). Sgt. White explained that it must be voluntary and he should consult counsel. The interview stopped so Sgt. White could obtain a DNA kit and Mr. Tessier could go for a smoke. When they returned to the interview room, Mr. Tessier declined to provide a DNA sample. He said that he had spoken to a friend who told him that he did not know what was going on and the police could be “painting [him] into a corner” (p. 130). Sgt. White suggested that Mr. Tessier had a “great deal of emotion” and was “on the edge” (p. 131).

[133]                     Secondly, Sgt. White asked to look at Mr. Tessier’s shoes to “eliminate” him (p. 130). Mr. Tessier complied and Sgt. White took a photocopy of the bottom of the shoe. While the interview was ongoing, other officers travelled to Mr. Tessier’s truck and concluded that the tire tread was a possible match to the impressions on scene. Thirdly, Sgt. White went with Mr. Tessier to his truck and collected a bottle of Tylenol and a cheque that belonged to the victim.

[134]                     The interview lasted approximately 105 minutes. When the discussion came to an end, Mr. Tessier asked if he was free to leave and he was told that he was. After the first interview, the police held a briefing and set up a team to surveil Mr. Tessier.

[135]                     When Mr. Tessier and Sgt. White spoke again, Sgt. White made further statements indicating that he suspected Mr. Tessier, including: “I think there’s something really bothering ya and that’s why you’re here again” and “[s]ometimes things happen and you wish you could turn the clock back” (pp. 155-56). Sgt. White told him: “You look tired. You look [like] you haven’t sle[pt] for two days . . . you haven’t shaved in a couple of days . . . you look worn” (p. 158). He also asked whether money was “a major stress factor” for Mr. Tessier, how much Mr. Berdahl owed him and if there was any reason Mr. Berdahl would “all of [a] sudden be not your friend” or “make you upset” (pp. 157 and 159).

[136]                     During the first and second interviews, Mr. Tessier was not warned about his right to counsel, his right to silence, or that anything he said could be used in evidence. Sgt. White did not tell Mr. Tessier that his participation in the interview was optional, that the closed door was unlocked, or that he was free to go at any time. Mr. Tessier was advised of his right to counsel and received a warning that his statements may be used against him only when the police went to his home and discovered his gun was missing. At that time, Sgt. White incorrectly advised that only statements he made after the warning could be used against him. When Mr. Tessier asked for clarification, Sgt. White said that only what he said going forward could be used in court against him.

[137]                     Sgt. White testified that Mr. Tessier was not a suspect during those interviews because they did not have any evidence implicating him, although police wanted to “confirm his alibi” and “eliminate him” (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 39‑40). Mr. Tessier became a “person of interest” during the second interview when he disclosed that he had recently picked up a firearm from the shooting range (p. 63). Sgt. White defined a person of interest as someone “worthy of further scrutiny into his actions and movements to verify or eliminate” as the person responsible for the death (p. 63).

[138]                     Sgt. White also testified that the purpose of interviewing a suspect is “to get an admission of guilt” (p. 86). He agreed that reading interviewees their Charter rights “makes them less comfortable” and can “sto[p] them from talking further” (p. 86). On cross-examination, Sgt. White admitted: “I was hoping that [Mr. Tessier] would confess” and “if he wanted to confess, I was there” (pp. 117, 125 and 128).

[139]                     In both interviews, Mr. Tessier denied involvement in or knowledge of the circumstances of Mr. Berdahl’s death, but made a number of admissions and statements that were later proven false. The Crown sought to rely on his statements at trial. The trial judge admitted both statements as voluntary. The Court of Appeal found legal errors in the trial judge’s analysis, allowed the appeal, set aside Mr. Tessier’s conviction and ordered a new trial to consider whether Mr. Tessier had made a meaningful choice to speak to police.

III.         Analysis

A.           Voluntariness Requires the Court to Scrutinize Whether the Accused Made a Meaningful Choice to Speak With Authorities

(1)         Overview

[140]                     As we will explain, voluntariness exists only where an accused makes a meaningful choice to speak with police. This reflects the confessions rule’s concern for a person’s right to choose whether to speak with police, a concern that underlies the privilege from self-incrimination and the right to silence. A meaningful choice is an informed choice. Interviewees must be informed of their right to silence and of the consequences of speaking to police. This is the information traditionally contained in a standard police caution, which appears in the English Judges Rules of 1912.

[141]                     In what follows, we refer to the standard police caution as a warning to differentiate it from the Charter cautions that police provide to fulfill their informational duties under ss. 10(a) and 10(b) of the Charter. While this Court referred to “warning[s]” and “caution[s]” interchangeably in Boudreau v. The King, 1949 CanLII 26 (SCC), [1949] S.C.R. 262 (at p. 267, citing Gach v. The King, 1943 CanLII 32 (SCC), [1943] S.C.R. 250, at p. 254), the meaning of a caution has taken on a different connotation in the Charter era. Police administer a variety of cautions upon arrest or detention to meet their Charter obligations, and a complex jurisprudence governs their content. Our approach, however, does not impose upon the warning necessary to show an informed choice the same requirements that govern cautions under the Charter. We therefore use the term “warning” to avoid confusion over its meaning and scope.

[142]                     This Court’s approach to a warning, stated in Boudreau, has not been reviewed to account for Hebert’s recognition of the need for an informed choice. To give effect to this requirement, we propose that the Crown must show that police warned an interviewee of the right to silence and the consequences of speaking where the police initiated contact with an individual to secure information about a crime they were investigating. Absent that warning, a presumption of involuntariness arises which, if not rebutted, renders any statement inadmissible, since police cannot assume interviewees understand their rights or their risks. The presumption can be rebutted by showing that the interviewee was nonetheless aware of the right to remain silent and that anything said could be used in evidence. As a practical matter, the Crown’s burden in rebutting the presumption will increase when the objective risk of self-incrimination at the time of making the statement is heightened. Where, for example, the interview is conducted in a police station, the concomitant adversarial nature and the likelihood a witness becomes a suspect or detainee as a result will call for clear and compelling evidence that, notwithstanding the absence of a warning, the interviewee made an informed choice to speak, in the sense of understanding the right to remain silent and that anything said could be used in evidence.

[143]                     As we will explain below, it is our respectful view that, for several reasons, our proposed approach is to be preferred over Boudreau. We begin, however, with an overview of voluntariness and the need for an informed choice.

(2)         Nature and Scope of the Confessions Rule

[144]                     The common law confessions rule requires the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an accused’s statement was voluntarily made. It applies to all oral and written statements made to a person in authority and tendered by the Crown in criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings, whether the accused was detained or not (S. N. Lederman, M. K. Fuerst and H. C. Stewart, Sopinka, Lederman & Bryant: The Law of Evidence in Canada (6th ed. 2022), at ¶8.13). The remedy is automatic exclusion.

[145]                     Importantly, the confessions rule captures not only inculpatory statements (such as where the accused confesses to committing the crime) but also exculpatory statements (S. Penney, V. Rondinelli and J. Stribopoulos, Criminal Procedure in Canada (3rd ed. 2022), at ¶4.4; Piché v. The Queen, 1970 CanLII 182 (SCC), [1971] S.C.R. 23, at p. 36, per Hall J.). Statements may contain both admissions and denials, and even statements that are exculpatory on their face may be used against the accused (F. Kaufman, The Admissibility of Confessions (3rd ed. 1979), at p. 6). In this case, for instance, Mr. Tessier did not confess to the murder but provided information that the Crown relied on at trial as circumstantial evidence of his guilt.

[146]                     The confessions rule is closely related to, and indeed derives from, two longstanding common law principles: the right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination (Singh, at paras. 21 and 24). All three are concerned for the right of the individual to choose whether to make a statement to the authorities, and for the repute and integrity of the judicial process (Hebert, at pp. 164 and 173). The common law right to silence “reflects the general principle that, absent statutory or other legal compulsion, no one is obligated to provide information to the police or respond to questioning” (Singh, at para. 27). Similarly, the privilege against self‑incrimination is rooted in the idea that a citizen involved in the criminal process must be accorded protections against the overwhelming power of the state, and in the related idea that accused persons have no obligation to give evidence against themselves (Hebert, at p. 174). 

[147]                     The confessions rule is a common law rule that exists independently of the Charter. Certain Charter protections arise only at a particular point in the criminal process, based on the legal jeopardy faced by an individual. Only people who are detained or arrested must be told of their Charter right to retain and instruct counsel under s. 10(b), which is also called being Chartered. Those who are detained and arrested must also be told that they have the right to remain silent and to not incriminate themselves, although the Court in Singh held the significance of this warning diminishes if detainees exercised their s. 10 right to counsel (para. 33). This “caution” conveys that the detainees or arrestees need not say anything to the police and that what they say can be used in evidence. Under the confessions rule, even before there is a detention or arrest, if an interviewee is suspected of committing an offence, the police are also advised to warn that person (Singh, at paras. 32-33). 

[148]                     The most important difference for our purposes is that the confessions rule applies from the outset of the interaction between the individual and the police, whether or not the individual is detained or arrested. In assessing whether a person made a meaningful choice to speak with authorities and understood the implications of doing so, the entire interaction, from beginning to end, must be reviewed; to be admissible, the accused’s statements must always be voluntary. Further, the rule is not triggered by the status of the individual (a potential suspect, a person of interest, a real suspect, or a detainee) at any discernible point in time. It operates anytime that anyone speaks to an agent of the state and applies throughout the entire dealings between them.

[149]                     The parties agree that the confessions rule aims to balance an individual’s right to choose whether to speak to the authorities and society’s interest in the investigation of crime. But this is not a simple tug-of-war between the police and accused persons. Society’s interest encompasses more than investigating crime; the public also has an interest in protecting individual rights and ensuring fairness in the administration of justice (Hebert, at p. 182). As this Court has recognized, therefore, the modern confessions rule has two objectives: “. . . to ensure trial fairness and to preclude conviction of an accused based upon compelled and as such inherently unreliable evidence” (R. v. Paterson, 2017 SCC 15, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 202, at para. 16).

[150]                     This is confirmed by a brief review of the common law confessions rule over the years, which illustrates that voluntariness has moved beyond a negative inquiry concerned with police inducements, trickery, and oppression. While historically concerned with statements obtained by “fear of prejudice or hope of advantage”, the rule’s purpose now embraces fairness concerns and the accused’s “meaningful choice” to speak with police (Ibrahim v. The King, [1914] A.C. 599 (P.C.), at p. 609).

(3)         Expansion of the Confessions Rule

[151]                     The confessions rule traces back to the 18th century, when courts recognized that “a confession forced from the mind by the flattery of hope, or by the torture of fear” was inadmissible at trial (R. v. Warickshall (1783), 1 Leach 263, 168 E.R. 234, at p. 235). The formal police caution (or warning, as we call it) appeared in the English Judges Rules of 1912, which guided police officers to warn, before charging any person with a crime or conducting a custodial interview, of the right to silence and that any statement may “be given in evidence” (R. v. K.P.L.F., 2010 NSCA 45, 290 N.S.R. (2d) 387, at paras. 21-24, citing R. v. Voisin, [1918] 1 K.B. 531 (C.C.A.), at p. 539; Kaufman, at pp. 149-52). In 1964, the Rules were amended to require the warning be given “[a]s soon as a police officer has evidence which would afford reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person has committed an offence” (Practice Note (Judges’ Rules), [1964] 1 W.L.R. 152, at p. 153).

[152]                     By the mid-20th century, the confessions rule and the warning were well established in Canadian criminal law. In Prosko v. The King (1922), 1922 CanLII 584 (SCC), 63 S.C.R. 226, this Court adopted a test articulated by the Privy Council in the 1914 decision of Ibrahim:

     It has long been established as a positive rule of English criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority. [p. 609]

[153]                     For a brief period in the 1940s, the absence of a warning was an absolute bar to the admissibility of a statement made as a result of police questioning (Gach). Then, in the 1949 decision of Boudreau, this Court backtracked, holding that the presence or absence of a warning is an important but not determinative factor in determining voluntariness:

The fundamental question is whether a confession of an accused offered in evidence is voluntary. The mere fact that a warning was given is not necessarily decisive in favour of admissibility but, on the other hand, the absence of a warning should not bind the hands of the Court so as to compel it to rule out a statement. All the surrounding circumstances must be investigated and, if upon their review the Court is not satisfied of the voluntary nature of the admission, the statement will be rejected. Accordingly, the presence or absence of a warning will be a factor and, in many cases, an important one. [Emphasis added; p. 267.]

[154]                     This is the nearly 75-year old rule, stated over 30 years before the Charter, and coupled with concerns only for police coercion and inducements, which informs the majority’s analysis (see paras. 5, 52, 62, 64 and 72). But since the Charter, broader fairness concerns have come to characterize our understanding of the terms of interaction between the individual and the state — concerns which have moved our jurisprudence. 

[155]                     And so, in Hebert, the Court held that voluntariness connotes a “broader” conception that protects a choice between alternatives (at p. 166), which is reflected in the operating mind doctrine. One of the themes underlying the confessions rule is the idea that “a person in the power of the state’s criminal process has the right to freely choose whether or not to make a statement to the police”, coupled with a “correlative concern with the repute and integrity of the judicial process” (p. 173). Those same concerns underlay the privilege against self-incrimination and supported recognition of a detainee’s right to silence as a principle of fundamental justice under s. 7 of the Charter (p. 175). The scope of the common law right to silence must, the Court continued, recognize a detainee’s right to make a meaningful choice whether to speak to authorities or to remain silent. Rejecting the Ibrahim rule as too narrow, the majority formulated a confessions rule which “permits consideration of the accused’s informed choice, as well as fairness to the accused and the repute of the administration of justice” (p. 182 (emphasis added)).

[156]                     In R. v. Whittle, 1994 CanLII 55 (SCC), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 914, this Court held that the right to counsel, the right to silence, and the common law confessions rule operate together to provide a standard of reliability with respect to evidence obtained from detained persons and to ensure fairness in the investigatory process (p. 939). A shared element of all three rules is the right to make a choice in relation to action by the state and whether the action by the authorities deprived the suspect of making an effective choice by reason of coercion, trickery or misinformation or the lack of information (pp. 931-32). Whittle also developed an analytical framework for the operating mind requirement, confirming that it only “requires that the accused possess a limited degree of cognitive ability to understand what he or she is saying and to comprehend that the evidence may be used in proceedings against the accused” (p. 939 (emphasis added)). The Court declined to set a higher standard that would include an understanding of the consequences of confessing or the ability to make a wise choice (p. 936).

[157]                     In Oickle, the Court affirmed Hebert’s choice “between alternatives” as an aspect of voluntariness, which is “most evident” in the operating mind doctrine (paras. 25-26, citing Hebert, at p. 166). The common law confessions rule encompasses broader fairness concerns, the Court observed, and a confession may be involuntary even where reliability is not at issue (para. 27). Four circumstances that commonly vitiate voluntariness were then outlined: (a) threats or promises; (b) oppression; (c) lack of an operating mind; and (d) police trickery that “shocks the community” (paras. 47-67, citing Rothman v. The Queen, 1981 CanLII 23 (SCC), [1981] 1 S.C.R. 640, at p. 697). The Court cautioned, however, that “[h]ard and fast rules simply cannot account for the variety of circumstances that vitiate the voluntariness of a confession”, that voluntariness is “shorthand for a complex of values”, and that the analysis “must be a contextual one” (paras. 47 and 70-71, citing J. H. Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law (Chadbourn rev. 1970), vol. 3, § 826, at p. 351). Despite that accompanying caution, lower courts — like the trial judge in this case — have treated these four factors as an exhaustive and determinative checklist for satisfying the Crown’s burden.

[158]                     And yet, in Singh, this Court affirmed that the common law confessions rule, like the right to silence, is a manifestation of a broader principle against self-incrimination (para. 21). Voluntariness, the Court explained, is a broader concept grounded in a “complex of values”, including “respect for the individual’s freedom of will, the need for law enforcement officers themselves to obey the law, and the overall fairness of the criminal justice system” (para. 30 (emphasis in original)). Thus it has long embraced the principle that a person is not obliged to give information to the police or to answer questions (para. 31). This component of the voluntariness rule is reflected in the usual warning given to a suspect and in the significance attached to its presence as a factor in determining the voluntariness of a statement (para. 31, citing Boudreau; R. v. Fitton, 1956 CanLII 28 (SCC), [1956] S.C.R. 958; R. v. Esposito (1985), 1985 CanLII 118 (ON CA), 24 C.C.C. (3d) 88 (Ont. C.A.)).

[159]                     Importantly, the Court in both Oickle and Singh emphasized that the modern confessions rule “clearly includes the right of the detained person to make a meaningful choice whether or not to speak to state authorities” (Singh, at para. 35 (emphasis added); Oickle, at paras. 24-27). Voluntariness requires the court to consider whether the accused was denied the right to silence (Singh, at para. 37). In assessing voluntariness, the focus is on the conduct of the police and its effect on the suspect’s ability to exercise free will. The test is objective but the individual characteristics of the accused are relevant considerations (para. 36).

(4)         The Modern Conception of Meaningful Choice Goes Beyond an Operating Mind

[160]                     The Court of Appeal’s decision is entirely consistent with this Court’s statements in Hebert, Whittle, Oickle and Singh. While the majority confines the Court’s statements in Hebert and Singh to detainees (see paras. 52, 55, 75 and 79), we would give them full force. Voluntariness requires the court to scrutinize whether the accused was denied the right to silence under the Charter or the common law. The inquiry focuses predominantly on the accused’s ability to make a meaningful choice whether to speak to police (Singh, at para. 35; Lederman, Fuerst and Stewart, at ¶8.71, citing Hebert, at p. 182). Since voluntariness requires a meaningful choice, it must also require access to information guiding that choice. It follows that a meaningful choice to speak cannot be made without knowing whether one is required to speak and whether there are consequences to doing so. As the respondent says, “[f]or a person’s will to be overborn[e] they must have a will to refuse to begin with. Knowledge of the information contained within a police caution is what creates such a will” (R.F., at para. 41 (emphasis in original)). It follows, then, as a matter of simple logic that the state may need to correct an information asymmetry before a statement will be found voluntary.

[161]                     The majority relies on the operating mind principle as stated in Whittle and Oickle, which is admittedly a low threshold. The majority says the “default assumption” is that an operating mind exists absent a cognitive impairment (para. 52). In our view, the operating mind doctrine always presumes an accused already had some information about the right to silence. Hence the issue in Whittle, which was, specifically, whether an accused person had the cognitive capacity to understand what they were told and what they said to police. The reason for this is apparent in Oickle, where the Court affirmed the operating mind doctrine follows from the conception of voluntariness as a choice between alternatives. True, it inquires into an accused’s cognitive capacity; but an accused’s cognitive capacity to choose between alternatives is meaningless without information about those alternatives. The doctrine therefore presumes accused persons are informed of their rights, and the inquiry is into whether they understood them. Indeed, Oickle affirmed the doctrine involves no “higher degree of awareness than knowledge of what the accused is saying and that he is saying it to police officers who can use it to his detriment” (Whittle, at p. 936 (emphasis added); Oickle, at para. 63).

[162]                     Further, in Hebert, Whittle, Oickle and Singh, the accused persons were all actually warned or Charter cautioned.

[163]                     The accused in Oickle was given warnings or Charter cautions on three occasions. First, before asking him to take a polygraph test, the officer told Mr. Oickle that he was not under arrest or detention, the door was not locked, he was free to leave at any time, he was not required to “sit here and talk to [him]” but anything he said could be admissible in court, and that he had the option to contact a lawyer or legal aid (R. v. Oickle (1998), 1998 NSCA 59 (CanLII), 164 N.S.R. (2d) 342 (C.A.), at para. 80). Secondly, during Mr. Oickle’s interrogation, the officer reiterated that he had the right to a lawyer and could “walk out at any time” (Oickle (SCC), at para. 7). Finally, after confessing to setting a fire, Mr. Oickle was arrested, warned of his right to counsel, and given a secondary police caution. The Court concluded he was “fully apprised of his rights at all times”, including his rights to silence, to a lawyer, and to leave at any time (Oickle, at paras. 6-7 and 72). The inquiry therefore focused on whether the police inducements were sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to voluntariness. Oickle demonstrates that an operating mind and the absence of inducements, oppressive circumstances, and police trickery are always necessary but not sufficient conditions.

[164]                     Likewise, the Crown argued before us that Whittle did not require the Court to consider whether the accused could make a meaningful choice. Importantly, however, and as ignored by the Crown and the majority, Whittle was a case about cognitive capacity. The basic informational component of a caution was presumed in the Court’s analysis (Whittle, at p. 941). Mr. Whittle suffered from schizophrenia. He was arrested on outstanding warrants and informed of his right to counsel, which he did not exercise. While in his cell, he told the officers that he committed a murder and three robberies. After verifying the incidents, the police warned Mr. Whittle and informed him of his right to counsel, which he again declined to exercise. He provided more details on the murder. He was informed once again of his right to counsel, which he then opted to exercise. After speaking with his lawyer, who informed him of his right to silence, Mr. Whittle agreed to speak with police. He was warned again and informed of his right to counsel. He continued to provide details on the incidents (R. v. Whittle (1992), 1992 CanLII 12777 (ON CA), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 49 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 54-60). Thus, the Court in Whittle was concerned not with whether the accused was informed of the contents of a warning, which he clearly was, but whether he could understand it (p. 941).

[165]                     Similarly, in both Hebert and Singh, the accuseds had been Charter cautioned. Mr. Hebert was arrested on a robbery charge and informed of his right to counsel. After arriving at the RCMP detachment, he contacted counsel and obtained advice on his right to refuse to give a statement. After exercising his right to counsel, the police took Mr. Hebert to an interview room, gave him “the usual police caution”, and asked him what he had done (p. 159). He said he did not wish to make a statement. He was then placed in a cell with an undercover police officer, who engaged Mr. Hebert in a conversation during which he made various incriminating statements (pp. 158-59). Mr. Singh was arrested for second degree murder. He was advised of his right to counsel under s. 10(b) and privately consulted with counsel. During two subsequent interviews, he stated on numerous occasions that he did not want to talk about the incident, he did not know anything about it, or he wanted to return to his cell. The officer told Mr. Singh: “You don’t have to talk to me if you don’t want to talk to me” (R. v. Singh, 2003 BCSC 2013, at para. 7 (CanLII)). Nonetheless, the officer continued to deflect Mr. Singh’s assertions and engage him in conversation. Mr. Singh did not confess to the crime but made incriminating statements (Singh (SCC), at para. 2).

[166]                     The majority writes that the accused persons in Hebert, Whittle, Oickle and Singh were each warned because they were detained, since “the Charter mandated that certain information . . . be communicated to them by the police” (para. 55). To be clear, we do not dispute that the Charter required the police to give cautions in the foregoing cases inasmuch as the accused persons were detained and their Charter right to counsel was engaged. We say, however, that the confessions rule also mandates a warning in order to give effect to an accused’s right to make a meaningful choice between alternatives. Again, Whittle recognized that the right to counsel and the confessions rule protect a “right to choose . . . in relation to state action” and ask whether the accused has been deprived of that choice by reason of, among other things, a lack of information (pp. 931-32). Our point is that this informational aspect to the confessions rule was not contested in the foregoing cases since, unlike here, it was satisfied by providing a Charter warning.

[167]                     It follows that the majority’s reliance on Hebert, Whittle, Oickle and Singh for the notion that the need for a warning is limited to circumstances where the interviewee is a suspect or detainee (at para. 55) is simply not well-founded.

B.            The Significance of a Warning Under the Modern Conception of Voluntariness

[168]                     This brings us to the significance of a warning in the modern conception of voluntariness. The Crown conceded, and the majority agrees, that it would be prudent for police to warn a witness before conducting a police station interview. We further agree with the majority that the presence or absence of a warning will not always be determinative of the voluntariness inquiry (though it has been a relevant factor in the voluntariness analysis since Ibrahim “and, in many cases, an important one” (Boudreau, at p. 267)). What divides us is how the absence of a warning should be treated in the voluntariness analysis, particularly in circumstances where the interviewee was neither a suspect nor detainee. Before outlining our approach, we review the current status of a warning in such circumstances.

[169]                     This Court has not directly addressed the impact of the absence of a warning since the Charter was enacted. In Singh, it adopted a “useful yardstick” for when to warn an interviewee, explaining that the warning should be given “when there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the person being interviewed has committed an offence” (para. 32, citing R. Marin, Admissibility of Statements (9th ed. (loose-leaf)), at pp. 2-24.2 and 2-24.3). Police may consider what they would do if the person attempted to leave the questioning room or officer’s presence — if the answer is arrest or detain the person, the warning should be given. The Court held that even where the suspect has not been formally arrested or obviously detained, police officers are “well advised” to give a warning in those circumstances (para. 33).

[170]                     Despite Boudreau’s long history and this Court’s recent guidance in Singh, a consistent response in the lower courts to the failure to warn an interviewee has yet to emerge. The failure to warn a suspect was a significant factor for ruling a statement involuntary in R. v. Worrall, [2002] O.J. No. 2711 (QL), 2002 CarswellOnt 5171 (WL) (S.C.J.); R. v. Higham, 2007 CanLII 20104 (Ont. S.C.J.); R. v. Garnier, 2017 NSSC 338; R. v. Morrison, [2000] O.J. No. 5733 (QL), 2000 CarswellOnt 5811 (WL) (S.C.J.); and R. v. Randall, 2003 CanLII 2205 (Ont. S.C.J.). Those cases turned on whether the person being interviewed was a suspect at the time, and applied different standards to answer that question.

[171]                     A distinct approach to warnings has emerged in Ontario. The Court of Appeal for Ontario has rejected the suggestion that involuntariness follows directly from the absence of a warning, even where the interviewee was a suspect at the time (see, e.g., R. v. Joseph, 2020 ONCA 73, 385 C.C.C. (3d) 514, at para. 53; R. v. Pearson, 2017 ONCA 389, 348 C.C.C. (3d) 277, at para. 19; R. v. Bottineau, 2011 ONCA 194, 269 C.C.C. (3d) 227, at para. 88; R. v. Al-Enzi, 2021 ONCA 81, 401 C.C.C. (3d) 277, at para. 86). The Crown relies on those cases, but neglects to mention that they all involved some form of modified warning or a Charter caution. The accused in Bottineau was provided a K.G.B. warning and told that he did not have to make a statement (paras. 89-92). In Joseph, the accused was told he did not need to answer the police’s questions and he could speak with a lawyer (para. 58). In Pearson, the accused was not warned in his first interview, but during the second interview, he was told that he was free to leave, he did not have to speak, and anything he said was admissible in court (paras. 20-22).

[172]                     These inconsistent approaches to warnings illustrate the bases for some of the common criticisms of the modern confessions rule. The confessions rule offers “protections beyond those guaranteed by the Charter”: the accused benefits from its application outside arrest and detention, the Crown bears a weighty burden of proof, and the remedy is automatic exclusion (Oickle, at para. 31; L. Dufraimont, “The Common Law Confessions Rule in the Charter Era: Current Law and Future Directions” (2008), 40 S.C.L.R. (2d) 249, at p. 265). Yet commentators have criticized the modern contextual approach to the confessions rule for failing to provide “clear and useful guidance” to police and courts on permissible police interrogation tactics (Dufraimont, at pp. 258-59; see also S. Penney, “What’s Wrong with Self-Incrimination? The Wayward Path of Self-Incrimination Law in the Post-Charter Era — Part II: Self-Incrimination in Police Investigations” (2004), 48 Crim. L.Q. 280, at p. 285). It has been further criticized for inviting dubious police conduct (see, for instance, D. Stuart, “Oickle: The Supreme Court’s Recipe for Coercive Interrogation” (2001), 36 C.R. (5th) 188; E. Thomas, “Lowering the Standard: R. v. Oickle and the Confessions Rule in Canada” (2006), 10 Can. Crim. L.R. 69; see also R. v. Sinclair, 2010 SCC 35, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 310, at paras. 77 and 89-99, per Binnie J., dissenting). Professor Penney has proposed brighter lines on the types of conduct that compromise the voluntariness of an accused’s statement under the confessions rule (“Police Questioning in the Charter Era: Adjudicative versus Regulatory Rule-making and the Problem of False Confessions” (2012), 57 S.C.L.R. (2d) 263, at pp. 274-84).

[173]                     In our view, these criticisms of the confessions rule are all applicable to this Court’s approach to warnings in the voluntariness analysis. The role of a warning in the voluntariness analysis requires greater clarity, brighter lines and increased protections for individuals.

[174]                     Since Boudreau, courts have been instructed that a failure to warn a suspect is “a factor and, in many cases, an important one” in assessing the voluntariness of the suspect’s statement. But Boudreau has led to little consistency in how courts approach the failure to warn a suspect. It has sometimes been afforded decisive weight in the analysis, as in Worrall, despite the absence of the traditional factors that undermine voluntariness (see, for instance, R. v. Lourenco, 2011 ONCA 782, 286 O.A.C. 187, at para. 7; Garnier, at paras. 71, 73, 76-77, 81 and 83 (CanLII)). Elsewhere, a failure to warn a suspect is dismissed as merely one factor to weigh among many (see, for instance, Pearson, at para. 19). Moreover, as this case illustrates, Boudreau does not assist witnesses who were aggressively questioned as though they were suspects. As well, if the timing of a warning relies only on the suspect rule, police may abuse the rule to avoid a warning by downplaying the importance of evidence or withholding key evidence from the interviewing officer to avoid triggering the need for a warning (R. v. Dunstan, 2017 ONCA 432, 348 C.C.C. (3d) 436, at para. 86).

[175]                     In our view, all this should lead the Court to adopt a new approach to warnings. To say that the “complex of values” guiding our notions of fairness and the administration of justice has evolved since Boudreau in 1949 is an understatement. (After all, Mr. Boudreau was hanged.) A more stringent approach to a warning is needed in the voluntariness analysis, one that better upholds the confessions rule’s modern protections for the common law right to silence and the principle against self-incrimination.

[176]                     While our colleagues take a half-step by recognizing a presumption of inadmissibility when statements are elicited from suspects without a warning, in our view the rule and its rationale require more. As explained below, we endorse a presumption of inadmissibility whenever police are investigating a crime and elicit a statement from a person about the crime without providing a warning. The importance of a warning increases with the objective risk of self-incrimination. Of course, one instance where the risk of self-incrimination is objectively heightened will continue to be where an interviewee is a suspect. But this will not be the only scenario where warnings are necessary. On our approach, then, Boudreau no longer has the last word on the weight of a warning in the voluntariness analysis.

C.            Where the Police Contact a Person to Secure Information During an Investigation, the Absence of a Warning Should Be Presumptively Determinative of Voluntariness

[177]                     Since the voluntariness inquiry focuses on whether the accused made a meaningful (and therefore informed) choice to speak to police, it follows that the Crown carries a burden to prove an informed choice. If the police provided a warning before obtaining a statement, this burden will be more easily discharged. But where no warning was given during a police interrogation, there is a rebuttable presumption that any statement was involuntary, and therefore, inadmissible.

[178]                     The presumption will not arise whenever an accused makes a statement to a person in authority, or to every interaction that an individual has with police. The presumption arises only where police investigate a crime and initiate contact with a person to secure information about the crime. As the confessions rule operates primarily to set common law limits on the coercive pressures of a police interrogation (Dufraimont, at p. 250, citing Oickle, at para. 1), the failure to provide a warning in those circumstances must render the statement presumptively involuntary. It cannot be assumed that an accused knew of the right to silence when questioned by police. As this Court’s jurisprudence on s. 9 of the Charter recognizes, most citizens are unaware of the precise limits of police powers and may believe they have an obligation to cooperate with police even during routine interactions (R. v. Le, 2019 SCC 34, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 692, at para. 26, citing S. Penney, V. Rondinelli and J. Stribopoulos, Criminal Procedure in Canada (2nd ed. 2018), at p. 83). Similarly, s. 10(b) jurisprudence, which is also rooted in the principle against self-incrimination, embraces the idea that detained persons must be immediately told of their rights, not that those rights are known to them already (R. v. Bartle, 1994 CanLII 64 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 173, at pp. 190-91). If our Charter jurisprudence does not assume citizens are aware of their rights when detained, we see no reason to make this assumption where individuals are subject to police interrogation that may fall short of formal detention but which nonetheless creates opportunities for pressure and coercion. Absent a warning, the statement is presumptively involuntary.

[179]                     To avoid triggering the presumption, police must do what our colleagues say they should do: give a warning. Interviewees must be informed that: (1) they do not need to speak to police; and (2) if they decide to speak, their statements may be used in evidence but their silence cannot. Simply informing interviewees of the right to silence is not enough. The consequences of speaking and of silence must be disclosed, since it is the consequences that allow witnesses to understand their options and what is at stake ⸺ that is, to make a meaningful choice. In evaluating whether the presumption is triggered, courts should focus on the substance of the warning, not its form, keeping in mind there is no uniform warning in Canada (K.P.L.F., at para. 28; L. Stuesser, “The Accused’s Right to Silence: No Doesn’t Mean No” (2002), 29 Man. L.J. 149). Police do not need to tell interviewees that they have a legal right to silence, but their options, like the consequences, should be made clear.

[180]                     The greater the objective risk of self-incrimination at the time the statement is made, the heavier the Crown’s burden to rebut the presumption by adducing clear and compelling evidence showing the interviewee made a meaningful choice, having been informed of the right to remain silent and the consequences of speaking. Jurisprudence on the confessions rule provides guidance on when the risk of self-incrimination is objectively heightened. The risk is objectively raised when an interviewee becomes a detainee or a suspect. Indeed, the majority acknowledges that “[f]airness concerns are manifest once an individual is targeted by the state” (para. 75). As recognized in Singh, it is important to affirm individuals’ right to silence after they are detained (para. 32). Detention accentuates imbalances of power between police and detainees, increasing their vulnerability to interrogation tactics, and it exerts a coercive pressure that, on its own, can prompt a detainee to confess (Singh, at para. 32; R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, at para. 22, citing Hebert, at pp. 179-80). Police suspects, too, are at a heightened risk of self-incrimination. Aside from being a likely target for increased coercive pressure, suspects face the greater likelihood that their statements will be used against them in court proceedings (Worrall, at para. 106; Lourenco, at paras. 6-7).

[181]                     Our approach accounts for how police station interviews represent another circumstance where the risk of self-incrimination is objectively heightened. A psychological detention is more likely to arise during such an interview. Interrogation rooms amplify the imbalances of physical and psychological power between police and an interviewee. As this Court has already recognized, interviewees may find the experience overwhelming (R. v. Crawford, 1995 CanLII 138 (SCC), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 858, at para. 25). Interrogations at a police station frequently begin with general, background questions before turning adversarial. Often police alternate between general and focused questioning. The precise point at which the interview turns adversarial, while difficult to pinpoint, is completely within the officer’s control. Just as officers may downplay whether they considered a person a suspect (as they did here), they may also downplay the adversarial nature of their questioning. Moreover, adversarial questioning can result in a witness becoming a suspect midway through an interview.

[182]                     The risk of self-incrimination is also objectively heightened when police engage in adversarial or aggressive questioning. The effect of police questioning on the accused is a longstanding consideration in assessing voluntariness under the confessions rule (see, for instance, Fitton, at p. 962, per Rand J.). To objectively raise the risk of self-incrimination, however, the questioning need not be so aggressive that interviewees could be led to falsely confess. A false confession in most cases “takes strong incentives, intense pressure and prolonged questioning” (Oickle, at para. 45, citing R. J. Ofshe and R. A. Leo, “The Social Psychology of Police Interrogation: The Theory and Classification of True and False Confessions” (1997), 16 Stud. L. Pol. & Soc. 189, at pp. 193-96). To objectively heighten the risk of self-incrimination, it will suffice if the questions are adversarial and police are investigating a crime. In this context, interviewees’ liberty is placed at risk when they are asked questions designed to elicit incriminating evidence, including confessions. That is true regardless of whether the police also considered the person a suspect.  

[183]                     We agree with the majority that the evidence is to be assessed from the perspective of a reasonably competent investigator and that the test is objective (paras. 81-82). As the facts of this case demonstrate, fixing the point at which a police officer can credibly claim to subjectively view an interviewee as a suspect is often slippery and elusive. The focus, then, is properly on the nature of the questions, objectively viewed. Adversarial or aggressive questions that heighten the risk of self-incrimination include those that insinuate witnesses are lying, accuse witnesses of committing the crime under investigation, ask witnesses to disprove their guilt, or otherwise invite witnesses to incriminate themselves. Similarly, in determining whether police were investigating a crime, a court should take an objective view, focusing on whether the officer’s questions indicated they were investigating a crime.

[184]                     As we have observed, the Crown concedes, as does the majority, that it is prudent for police to warn witnesses before an interview at a police station. This is because it will be easier to show the statement was voluntary where police do so (majority’s reasons, at para. 5). But the majority does not appear to appreciate that the converse must also be true: where police do not do so, the statement cannot be accepted as voluntary without some other basis for so deciding. And yet, each proposition follows from the concession that a warning is prudent practice. In other words, the same reason that giving a warning is prudent (to show voluntariness) also explains the problem in not giving a warning (without more, the statement is involuntary). In agreeing, therefore, that giving a warning is prudent, we would take that necessary next step: for the very reason that giving a warning is prudent, police must do so before conducting an interview in pursuit of a criminal investigation.

[185]                     The Crown argues that recognizing that voluntariness requires proof of an informed choice will require police to warn everyone with whom they interact. But that is an overstatement. On our approach, warnings are not required for statements made on 911 calls, complainant-initiated statements, spontaneous utterances, or unsolicited statements (as in R. v. Turcotte, 2005 SCC 50, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 519). Police are passive receivers of preliminary information in these circumstances. Nor are police required to warn an interviewee while actively responding to emergencies. Public safety may be jeopardized if police officers are required to ascertain voluntariness in respect of every person they speak to while responding to an emergency (Paterson, at para. 24). Finally, warnings are not appropriate in situations where people are obliged to speak with the police.

[186]                     The Crown’s burden to rebut the presumption of involuntariness is strict, but not insurmountable. Absent a warning, we agree with the Court of Appeal that a court must consider whether “the person making the statement understood they did not have to say anything, and understood that if they responded to questions, their answers could be used against them” (para. 37). Unlike the Court of Appeal, however, we conclude the accused’s behaviour and personal characteristics will rarely be probative of this question (para. 36). A focus on the interviewee’s willingness to talk, age or lack of vulnerability would mean that no warning is needed for most citizens. Yet this result runs against the very reason a warning is required: Canadians are largely unaware of their rights when interacting with police.

[187]                     Instead, the presumption may be rebutted in certain circumstances. First, it may be rebutted where accused persons received partial warnings, such as where they were informed they did not need to speak but were not told their statements could be used against them (as in R. v. M. (D.), 2012 ONCA 894, 295 C.C.C. (3d) 159, at paras. 44-45; Pearson, at paras. 20-22; Joseph, at para. 58; Bottineau, at para. 91). Similarly, where an accused received a warning during a recent interaction on the same matter, it may demonstrate that the accused made an informed choice in a subsequent interaction, notwithstanding the failure to warn the accused on that later occasion. Accused persons may also expressly state and acknowledge their legal rights, indicating they were able to make a meaningful choice (R. v. Engel, 2016 ABCA 48, 616 A.R. 181, at para. 18). While the circumstances in which the presumption may be rebutted are narrow, police can easily avoid this step by doing what the Crown and the majority already acknowledge as prudent: providing a warning.

[188]                     Lastly, and contrary to the majority’s assertions (at paras. 12, 41 and 74), discharging its burden does not require the Crown to show the accused waived the right to silence. Making an informed choice does not require “a particular state of knowledge” on the interviewee’s part (Hebert, at p. 177). Rather, the question is whether accused persons were provided information sufficient to know their rights (p. 177). Thus, even though a warning has a significant role in the voluntariness analysis under our approach, the inquiry into whether a warning was administered is an objective one. Where no warning was provided, it is open to the Crown to point to another objective source of the requisite information. As noted, in some cases, the source will be accused persons themselves if they express or reveal awareness of their right to silence or knowledge about the adverse consequences of speaking to police. As stated in Hebert, proof of an informed choice does not “place on the authorities and the courts the impossible task of subjectively gauging whether the suspect appreciates the situation and the alternatives” (p. 177). The Crown need only demonstrate that the police warned the accused or that another source of information substituted for the usual warning.

[189]                     For this reason, contrary to the majority’s suggestion (at para. 41), our proposal does not resurrect a waiver standard that was expressly rejected by McLachlin J. in Hebert (p. 183). Indeed, it is our approach which shows fidelity to Hebert’s guidance that the test for whether an accused’s right to choose was violated must be “essentially objective” (p. 177). Like Hebert, the focus is on whether a warning was provided (at p. 177), not on any subjective state of knowledge of the accused nor on whether the accused waived the right to choose to speak to police.

[190]                     To summarize, our revised approach takes seriously this Court’s injunction that voluntariness exists only where the accused made a meaningful — that is, informed — choice to speak with police. Where, therefore, police initiate contact with an individual to secure information about a crime they are investigating, there is a rebuttable presumption that any statement given without a warning was involuntary. Further, in circumstances where the risk of self-incrimination is objectively heightened — such as where the police take an adversarial approach or where there is information that, objectively viewed, would raise a reasonable suspicion that the individual was involved in the crime — clear and compelling evidence will be required showing the individual knew of the right to silence and that anything said could be used in evidence.

D.           Benefits of This Revised Approach

[191]                     We agree with the majority that the common law confessions rule has always sought to balance society’s interest in the investigation of crimes and an individual’s right to choose not to speak with police (paras. 4, 12, 41, 53, 56, 69, 73‑74 and 79). That said, its application has favoured the former over the latter. Uncertainty in the meaningful choice analysis and the significance of a warning inevitably favours the police, who can exploit ignorance of Charter rights to extract statements. Our proposed approach rights the balance by providing greater clarity on the timing of a warning and its role in the voluntariness analysis, while protecting the right to silence and those most vulnerable to coercive police pressure.

[192]                     Ensuring greater protections for vulnerable witnesses is one of the most compelling reasons to make a warning central to the voluntariness analysis. As this case illustrates, when questioning witnesses, police may use aggressive interrogation tactics to lead witnesses to believe they have been caught out and that they should “come clean” and “tell the truth”. To amplify the potency of these techniques, police may be tempted to keep witnesses in the dark about their right to silence.

[193]                     In our view, police should not be permitted to leverage ignorance of the right to silence to increase the coercive pressure of an interrogation. Such a tactic is corrosive of legality and individual liberty, and will inevitably disadvantage vulnerable persons, including those who may feel less capable of resisting police pressure, such as persons from communities subject to over-policing. Our approach provides greater protection for those witnesses least able to resist police interrogation tactics. In Oickle, this Court cautioned judges to be mindful of the danger of false confessions that arise in police interrogations of witnesses that are vulnerable due to “their background, special characteristics, or situation”, including those with “compliant personalities” and those “prone to accept and believe police suggestions” (para. 42, citing W. S. White, “False Confessions and the Constitution: Safeguards Against Untrustworthy Confessions” (1997), 32 Harv. C.R.-C.L. L. Rev. 105, at p. 120). Commentators have identified a range of characteristics that may make a person more likely to falsely confess (D. E. Ives, “Preventing False Confessions: Is Oickle Up to the Task?” (2007), 44 San Diego L. Rev. 477, at pp. 480-84). Interviewees may have difficulty appreciating the consequences of speaking with police or coping with the unusual stress of a police interview, as in the case of a person who has an intellectual disability (pp. 480-81). They may be conflict-averse and eager to please authorities (p. 482). Persons susceptible to police suggestion may demonstrate a lack of assertiveness, high anxiety, and low intelligence (p. 482). While not a complete solution, a warning can mitigate some of the risks associated with vulnerable witnesses that lead to false confessions. In the result, fairness is not the only justification for a warning: the reliability of confessions is also enhanced by our approach. 

[194]                     Indeed, we foresee greater protection for all witnesses, not just vulnerable witnesses. As noted, the confessions rule is one manifestation of the principle against self-incrimination and it protects the right to silence. It is “intended to ensure that the content of a suspect’s statement to a person in authority reflects his or her own reasons for speaking, such as a genuine desire to confess” and not “extraneous reasons”, like “improper conduct by state agents” (Stewart, at p. 522). Informing all witnesses of their options provides greater assurance that decisions to speak to police are freely made. In turn, this ensures the admission of a confession is less likely to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. This consideration aligns with the “broader notion of voluntariness”, which “prevail[s]” in the Charter era (Singh, at para. 34, citing Hebert, at pp. 166-67 and 173, per McLachlin J.).

[195]                     This broader notion of voluntariness also suggests a further reason for adopting our proposed approach. Witnesses who are ignorant of their choice about whether to speak to police may soon become witnesses who feel they have no choice except to speak to police, potentially leading to a breach of their rights under ss. 9 and 10(b) of the Charter. The lines around psychological detention are “murky” (Le, at para. 31). Police tactics that attempt to exploit these uncertain boundaries to obtain a confession, hoping that a court will not find the accused was arbitrarily detained or will nonetheless admit the evidence under s. 24(2), are incompatible with the confessions rule’s broader notion of voluntariness. For these reasons, we also disagree with the majority’s suggestion at para. 89 that a warning primarily acts as a sword for the Crown, or a tool that makes it easier to prove voluntariness, rather than a shield for the accused, which ensures the fairness and reliability of their statements to police.

[196]                     There are also practical benefits to our proposed approach. A wholly contextual inquiry into the weight of a warning does not offer clear guidance to police on when to warn. Unlike the majority’s approach, ours encourages police to avoid any uncertainty about the timing of a warning entirely. Our strong presumption of involuntariness encourages police to warn whenever police are investigating a crime and initiate contact with a person to secure information about the crime. Attaching real consequences to a failure to warn makes it easier for police to know when to administer a warning and for courts to evaluate the consequences of failing to do so.

[197]                     To this, the Crown’s response is at once unedifying and revealing. Asked at the hearing of this appeal to explain why it would be a problem for the police to inform people of their basic rights before questioning them, Crown counsel admitted: “. . . there is obviously no harm to doing it and there may in particular cases be significant benefit to doing it . . .” (transcript, at p. 14). Crown counsel later asserted that warning all interviewees could “needlessly alarm people”, “there is little to be gained”, and “it may in fact deter some number of people from speaking with the police” (pp. 16-17). However, the Crown ultimately conceded that “it may be a good idea for police in many cases to explain that information in an informal or nonthreatening way” (p. 18). The majority agrees. They write that there is “no doubt” that a warning can ensure an investigation is conducted fairly and they encourage police to warn interviewees, since it can make it easier to prove a statement is voluntary (para. 75). Despite this, the majority follows the Crown’s lead and concludes that a brighter-line rule that requires warnings for all interviewees, even when they are not suspects or detainees, is somehow unworkable.

[198]                     Yet neither the Crown nor the majority point to any specific harms that will flow from informing interviewees of their basic rights. The majority merely asserts that a brighter-line rule would “upset the balance” struck by the confessions rule and says it “could exact a cost on the administration of justice” (see paras. 7, 12, 55, 72 and 76). Our approach does not attach disproportionate consequences to a failure to warn, nor create a blanket rule that necessarily excludes statements obtained without a warning. It gives police a certainty they do not otherwise possess and, more importantly, it establishes a consistent protection for interviewees, the rights‑bearers for whom we must have primary regard. The only possible harm is that the police lose the advantage of psychological leverage when they level the informational playing field.

[199]                     In short, the Crown invites us to elevate ignorance of the right to silence into an essential tool for the investigation of crime. We would not do so. The right to silence is not a secret to be kept locked away in the pages of this Court’s decisions or left to the judgment calls of police officers who might be concerned that citizens will not be “comfortable” or that they might decide to exercise their right not to talk to police during criminal investigations. The purpose of the right to silence is, after all, to protect the ability of a citizen not to speak to police. We are not remotely persuaded by the Crown’s criticism, which really reduces to this: if people are actually informed of their rights, they may in fact exercise them; and that the power imbalance and informational asymmetry of which we speak is structurally necessary for police to do their job. That is the “cost” to the administration of justice to which the majority alludes without explicitly acknowledging at para. 76 of its reasons. We take a very different view of what fairness and the administration of justice requires. More particularly, we reject utterly that the capacity of police to do their job is so fragile that it depends, in any measure, on people remaining in the dark about their rights when asked to speak with police.

[200]                     This normative objection is entirely aside from the speculative quality of the Crown’s argument that our approach would unduly impede police investigations and have a chilling effect on people’s willingness to speak with police. There is no empirical or even anecdotal evidence before us about the effect this requirement would have on police investigations. What is indisputable, however, is that the right to silence will be chilled under the majority’s approach.

[201]                     To all this, the majority says that Boudreau “has stood the test of time” (para. 73). Indeed, it has ⸺ a very long time, during which much water has flowed under the jurisprudential bridge. To be faithful to our jurisprudence’s developments since Boudreau, we would consign it to the dustbin of history. Boudreau implicitly accepted that successful policing hinges, in part, on interviewees’ ignorance of their rights. We see this as incompatible with the “broader notion of voluntariness” that has prevailed in the Charter era, and that is concerned with according fairness to the accused and preserving respect for the administration of justice (Singh, at para. 34, citing Hebert, at pp. 166-67 and 173). The degree to which we extend the confessions rule should not be overstated. It must be remembered that Boudreau was itself a departure — indeed, a retrenchment — from the Court’s earlier statement in Gach, that “all confessions made to a person in authority, as a result of questioning, are inadmissible in evidence, unless proper caution has been given” (p. 254). Our approach does not go that far, but merely accords the warning its proper significance.

[202]                     Finally, an informed choice requirement leaves intact the doctrine of operating mind as set out in Whittle and Oickle. As discussed, the doctrine presumes the accused has been informed of the right to silence. This aspect of the doctrine was not at issue in Whittle, since the accused was repeatedly warned or Charter cautioned. Our reasons do not lower the high threshold for the types of mental states that impair an accused’s ability to understand what is said. Rather, they merely express the doctrine’s informational component.

[203]                     Therefore, the benefits to our revised approach are several: it protects individuals from police coercion, promotes the right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination that animate the confessions rule, and benefits police and judges by clarifying the importance of a warning and its role in the voluntariness inquiry.

IV.         Application

[204]                     We agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial judge made legal errors in assessing the voluntariness of Mr. Tessier’s statements. The police initiated contact with Mr. Tessier to secure information about a homicide investigation. This alone triggered the need for a warning. The Crown therefore had to demonstrate that Mr. Tessier made an informed choice to speak to Sgt. White. Since Sgt. White warned Mr. Tessier only upon seeing that his firearm was missing, Mr. Tessier’s prior statements were presumptively inadmissible.

[205]                     Further, the risk of Mr. Tessier incriminating himself was objectively heightened in these circumstances, making the presumption of inadmissibility more difficult to rebut. Mr. Tessier was interviewed at a police station, Sgt. White’s questioning turned adversarial and Mr. Tessier became a suspect partway through the first interview. That interview was comprehensive, lasting nearly two hours, and punctuated by evidentiary searches. Sgt. White was investigating a homicide and, as he acknowledged, hoping to get a confession from Mr. Tessier. Once his questioning took an adversarial turn in the first interview, the risk of self-incrimination was objectively heightened.

[206]                     The adversarial posture emerged early on, when Sgt. White insinuated that Mr. Tessier had killed the deceased. Remarking on Mr. Tessier’s presence in Didsbury, near where Mr. Berdahl’s body was found, Sgt. White observed it was “[p]retty coincidental”. Sgt. White returned to the point a few questions later, again insinuating Mr. Tessier’s answers implicated him in Mr. Berdahl’s homicide. The adversarial questioning escalated, with Sgt. White cross-examining Mr. Tessier on his whereabouts and activities leading up to the day of Mr. Berdahl’s death. When Mr. Tessier expressed uncertainty on certain points, Sgt. White remarked he was “[p]retty mixed up” and there was “only one reason for that”, again insinuating his guilt. Sgt. White then made two direct attempts to elicit a confession, asking Mr. Tessier to “[t]ell the truth” and later, asking Mr. Tessier directly whether he killed Mr. Berdahl. In response to Mr. Tessier’s denials, Sgt. White expressed disbelief and asked Mr. Tessier for proof that he did not kill Mr. Berdahl. Sgt. White followed up these questions with a request for Mr. Tessier’s DNA sample, so he could “eliminate” his DNA at the crime scene.

[207]                     After Mr. Tessier’s cigarette break during the first interview, Sgt. White continued to cross-examine Mr. Tessier on his whereabouts and on his activities in the days leading up to Mr. Berdahl’s death, as well as his relationship with Mr. Berdahl. Thus, the adversarial nature of the first interview remained unchanged after the cigarette break. We conclude that Mr. Tessier’s risk of self-incrimination was objectively heightened shortly after the first interview began and until Mr. Tessier left the interrogation room. Sgt. White’s testimony at trial supports this conclusion. He confirmed he hoped Mr. Tessier would confess.

[208]                     We would also conclude the risk of self-incrimination was objectively heightened when Mr. Tessier became a suspect. Considering Sgt. White’s questions and the totality of evidence before him, Sgt. White ought to have reasonably suspected early on in the first interview that Mr. Tessier was involved in Mr. Berdahl’s death. Before the first interview, it was known to police that: Mr. Tessier was the last person to see Mr. Berdahl alive; Mr. Berdahl’s death was deemed a homicide; and Mr. Tessier was Mr. Berdahl’s best friend but they had a conflict over a car and the deceased was planning to leave to Winnipeg. Early on during the first interview, Mr. Tessier confirmed that: he had owned the car at issue in the dispute; he had last seen Mr. Berdahl two days earlier; Mr. Berdahl planned to leave for Winnipeg; and he was in Didsbury, near Mr. Berdahl’s body, on the morning he learned of Mr. Berdahl’s death. This evidence ought to have generated a reasonable suspicion that Mr. Tessier could be culpable in Mr. Berdahl’s homicide. This conclusion is reinforced by Sgt. White’s questions. Shortly after Mr. Tessier provided this information, Sgt. White asked that “if you cross all the little lines, what does [that] look like?”.

[209]                     The remainder of the first interview only confirms this conclusion, since Sgt. White escalated his adversarial questioning. Mr. Tessier admitted that they had a conflict over money that Mr. Berdahl owed and Sgt. White observed Mr. Tessier was agitated and something was bothering him. Further, when Sgt. White ended the first interview, the police held a meeting and set up an RCMP team to conduct surveillance on Mr. Tessier. This was an obvious sign that Sgt. White gathered enough information to consider Mr. Tessier a suspect during the first interview.

[210]                     For these reasons, we agree with the majority that Mr. Tessier was a suspect after the first interview, which further increases the difficulty of rebutting the presumption of inadmissibility. Since Sgt. White also did not warn Mr. Tessier before the second interview, Mr. Tessier’s statements from both interviews were presumptively inadmissible as a result. In our view, the trial judge erred in law by overlooking the overwhelming objective evidence that Mr. Tessier was a suspect in favour of Sgt. White’s stated subjective belief. In his testimony, Sgt. White conceded Mr. Tessier became a “person of interest” when Mr. Tessier disclosed that he recently picked up a firearm from the shooting range. The trial judge placed undue weight on Sgt. White’s subjective classification of Mr. Tessier. Respectfully, given Sgt. White’s questions and the evidence before him, Sgt. White’s belief was unreasonable.

[211]                     In light of these factors, Mr. Tessier’s risk of self-incrimination was considerably heightened. While this adds to the Crown’s burden to rebut the presumption of involuntariness, it changes nothing here. The Crown has failed to adduce clear and compelling, or even any, evidence demonstrating that Mr. Tessier’s statements were voluntary. Mr. Tessier did not receive a warning during a prior interaction with Sgt. White on this matter. While Sgt. White informed Mr. Tessier he did not need to provide a DNA sample, he did not give a partial warning on his right to silence. Mr. Tessier expressed a concern about being “paint[ed] into a corner” but he did not expressly acknowledge his right to silence of which he was never informed.

[212]                     The Crown has failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Tessier’s statements were voluntary. Mr. Tessier’s statements during the first and second interview should have been excluded at trial.

V.           Conclusion

[213]                     The majority’s presumption of inadmissibility for statements elicited from suspects without a warning marks an improvement over Boudreau. Regrettably, however, the majority fails to take the logical next step that flows from its recognition that voluntariness protects a right to meaningfully choose to speak to police. We would take that step and recognize that police must warn interviewees, regardless of whether they are suspects or detainees. A presumption of inadmissibility with a broader application than the majority’s approach is consistent with the concept of meaningful choice in confessions law jurisprudence. And, it strives to see that interactions between the individual and the state are always characterized by “respect for the individual’s freedom of will, the need for law enforcement officers themselves to obey the law, and the overall fairness of the criminal justice system” (Singh, at para. 30 (emphasis deleted)). Achieving this here requires of this Court merely to enforce that which the majority acknowledges as prudent: that both parties know their rights.

[214]                     We therefore respectfully dissent. The appeal should be dismissed, and the order of the Court of Appeal setting aside Mr. Tessier’s conviction and ordering a new trial should be confirmed. Since we would dismiss the appeal on the basis that Mr. Tessier’s statements were involuntary, we need not address the issue of whether he was psychologically detained.

I.               Overview

[1]                             This appeal calls upon the Court to clarify the circumstances in which state regulation of land use may effect a de facto or (as we will refer to it) “constructive” taking of private property.

[2]                             The appellant, Annapolis Group Inc., contends that the respondent, Halifax Regional Municipality, improperly used its regulatory powers to effectively seize Annapolis’ land for use as a public park without compensation. Halifax says that Annapolis’ claim is a veiled attempt to make taxpayers foot the bill for a decades‑long development gamble. It sought summary dismissal of this part of Annapolis’ claim, while permitting other claims (for misfeasance in public office and unjust enrichment) to proceed to trial.

[3]                             Although unsuccessful at first instance, Halifax persuaded the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal that it should apply this Court’s judgment in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Vancouver (City), 2006 SCC 5, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 227 (“CPR”), to strike that claim. Annapolis asks this Court to restore its claim in respect of the alleged constructive taking and allow it to proceed to trial.

[4]                             We would allow Annapolis’ appeal. The Court of Appeal, in our respectful view, misapplied CPR and summary judgment principles. Read in harmony with the jurisprudence upon which it was decided, CPR signifies that a constructive taking occurs where: (1) a beneficial interest — understood as an advantage — in respect of private property accrues to the state, which may arise where the use of such property is regulated in a manner that permits its enjoyment as a public resource; and (2) the impugned regulatory measure removes all reasonable uses of the private property at issue. Further, the Court of Appeal erred by holding that Halifax’s intention is irrelevant to applying the second part of that analysis. This leaves genuine issues of material fact arising from Annapolis’ claim to be tried. Annapolis is entitled to adduce evidence at trial to show that, by holding Annapolis’ land out as a public park, Halifax has acquired a beneficial interest therein; and that, because Halifax is unlikely to ever lift zoning restrictions constraining the development of Annapolis’ land, Annapolis has lost all reasonable uses of its property. Further, and in support of the latter proposition, Annapolis may adduce evidence of Halifax’s intention in not doing so.

II.            Factual Background

[5]                             Over time from the 1950s, Annapolis acquired the subject property, comprising 965 acres of land (“Annapolis Lands” or “Lands”), with the intention of eventually securing enhanced development rights and reselling it.

[6]                             In 2006, Halifax adopted the Regional Municipal Planning Strategy, a guide for land development in the municipality, including the Annapolis Lands, over a 25‑year period. While the Planning Strategy reserved a portion of the Annapolis Lands for possible future inclusion in a regional park, it also zoned the Lands as “Urban Settlement” and “Urban Reserve”. Urban Settlement denotes an area where urban forms of development may occur. Urban Reserve identifies land that could be developed beyond the 25‑year horizon. These designations thus contemplate — but do not permit — future residential serviced development. For serviced development to occur on the Annapolis Lands, Halifax must adopt a resolution authorizing a “secondary planning process” and an amendment to the applicable land use by‑law. The applicable by‑law is the Halifax Mainland Land Use By‑Law, also adopted in 2006.

[7]                             In 2014, Halifax adopted a revised version of the Planning Strategy. The Urban Settlement and Urban Reserve designations were maintained, and thus the zoning of the Annapolis Lands did not change, and has not changed since 2006. Nor were the conceptual boundaries for the potential park altered.

[8]                             Beginning in 2007, Annapolis made several attempts to develop the Lands. Ultimately, by resolution dated September 6, 2016, Halifax refused to initiate the secondary planning process, and Annapolis sued, alleging a constructive taking, misfeasance in public office, and unjust enrichment.

[9]                             At issue in this appeal is Annapolis’ allegation of a constructive taking. Specifically, Annapolis says that Halifax’s regulatory measures have deprived it of all reasonable or economic uses of its land, resulting in a constructive taking without compensation, contrary to ss. 65 and 237 of the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter, S.N.S. 2008, c. 39, and ss. 6 and 24 of the Expropriation Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 156. It alleges in particular that Halifax has acquired a beneficial interest in the Lands by exercising dominion over them so as to effectively create a public park at Annapolis’ expense. According to Annapolis, members of the public hike, cycle, canoe, camp, and swim on the Lands, are encouraged to do so by Halifax, and Halifax financially supports organizations that also encourage people to use the Lands as a park. Further, signs posted on the Lands allegedly depict the municipality’s logo and phone number, and a media article quotes a municipal employee referred to as “the city staffer overseeing the park’s creation”.

[10]                        On March 11, 2019, Halifax moved for partial summary judgment of Annapolis’ claim, pursuant to r. 13 of the Nova Scotia Civil Procedure Rules. In its motion, Halifax sought the dismissal of Annapolis’ constructive taking claim and urged the motion judge to find that, as a matter of law, a constructive taking cannot result from Halifax refusing to amend the Planning Strategy and associated land use by‑laws. Annapolis resisted the motion, arguing that its claim raises genuine issues of material fact requiring a trial.

III.         Judicial History

A.           Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, 2019 NSSC 341, 17 L.C.R. (2d) 1 (Chipman J.)

[11]                        The motion judge dismissed Halifax’s partial summary judgment motion. He agreed with Annapolis that its constructive taking claim raised “vast” genuine issues of material fact requiring a trial, including:

(a)                  whether Halifax had erected signage on the Lands depicting Halifax’s logo on various trails;

(b)                  whether a Halifax employee had been “overseeing the park’s creation”;

(c)                  whether the Lands would be treated as development lands and not parklands;

(d)                  the existence of clauses in the Planning Strategy that mandate consideration of policy concepts without committing Council to adopt the policy, and clauses discussing an urban settlement designation boundary;

(e)                  discovery evidence to the effect that Halifax had decided that the Annapolis Lands would be treated as development lands, not parklands; and

(f)                    correspondence between counsel, including letters containing Halifax’s denial of Annapolis’ allegations.

[12]                        The motion judge also identified a triable issue in affidavit evidence suggesting the possibility of an ulterior motive on Halifax’s part — specifically, to reserve part of the Annapolis Lands for a public park. In this regard, he relied on Lorraine (Ville) v. 2646-8926 Québec inc., 2018 SCC 35, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 577, which involved a claim under Quebec’s Expropriation Act, CQLR, c. E‑24. In Lorraine, this Court affirmed that, where property is expropriated outside a legislative framework for an ulterior motive (such as to avoid paying an indemnity), a “disguised” expropriation occurs. In the motion judge’s view, disguised expropriation under the law of Quebec may be equated to constructive expropriation as that concept was understood by this Court in The Queen in Right of the Province of British Columbia v. Tener, 1985 CanLII 76 (SCC), [1985] 1 S.C.R. 533.

[13]                        In light of the foregoing, the motion judge concluded Annapolis’ constructive taking claim should proceed to trial. Expropriation cases, he said, are fact‑specific and offer different scenarios in which a constructive taking claim may succeed, and this case is no different. He added that the facts material to the constructive taking claim were “sufficiently interwoven” with Annapolis’ two other causes of action, such that “to deny Annapolis’ right to pursue this claim would not appreciably shorten pre-trial procedures or the trial” (para. 44). Thus he did not find the proportionality principle, as described in Hryniak v. Mauldin, 2014 SCC 7, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 87, to support granting summary judgment.

B.            Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, 2021 NSCA 3, 455 D.L.R. (4th) 349 (Beveridge, Farrar and Derrick JJ.A.)

[14]                        The Court of Appeal held that Annapolis’ constructive taking claim did not have a reasonable chance of successfully establishing, as CPR requires, an acquisition by Halifax of a beneficial interest in the Annapolis Lands or flowing from the Lands, and the removal of all reasonable uses of the Lands. Citing Mariner Real Estate Ltd. v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), 1999 NSCA 98, 177 D.L.R. (4th) 696, it held that limiting the use of land or reducing its value through regulation is insufficient. For Halifax to acquire a “beneficial interest” in the Annapolis Lands, land “must actually be taken” from Annapolis and acquired by Halifax (para. 71). This did not occur. Even had Halifax placed signage on the property to encourage its use by the public, this would, at most, have constituted a trespass by those using the lands. Annapolis has the same rights with respect to the Lands under the Planning Strategy that it has had for years. Nothing has changed. Nor, in the Court of Appeal’s view, would adopting a development plan constitute a taking. It simply allows a municipality to set future development goals and to ensure land will be developed (or not) accordingly.

[15]                        Finally, it said, Halifax’s intended use for the Lands is not relevant to the constructive taking analysis. Improper motive is not proof of a constructive taking, and Lorraine does not dictate a contrary conclusion.

IV.         Issues

[16]                        The foregoing account presents the issues to be decided:

(a)                  Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that an “acquisition of a beneficial interest” under the constructive taking test established by this Court in CPR requires land to “actually be taken” from an owner and acquired by the state? If not, should the CPR test be revisited?

(b)                     Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that evidence of the state’s intended use of the impugned land is irrelevant to a claim for constructive taking?

V.           Analysis

A.           Overview of the Law of Takings

[17]                        It is useful to begin with a brief overview of the law of takings. Given the facts of this appeal, our focus is on expropriation through regulation — which, again, we refer to as a “constructive taking” in preference to other commonly applied terms such as “de facto” or “regulatory taking”, as in our view it more accurately captures the nature of the state action at issue and the effect on the landowner (see e.g., M. Lavoie, “Canadian Common Law and Civil Law Approaches to Constructive Takings: A Comparative Economic Perspective” (2010), 42 Ottawa L. Rev. 229).

[18]                        A “taking” is a “forcible acquisition by the Crown of privately owned property . . . for public purposes” (K. Horsman and G. Morley, eds., Government Liability: Law and Practice (loose‑leaf), at § 5:1). It may take the form of a constructive taking (effective appropriation of private property by a public authority exercising its regulatory powers), or a de jure taking (formal expropriation), by (in the case of land) taking title.

[19]                        To be clear, not every instance of regulating the use of property amounts to a constructive taking. Governments and municipalities holding delegated provincial regulatory authority (Toronto (City) v. Ontario (Attorney General), 2021 SCC 34, at para. 2) validly regulate land in the public interest without effecting “takings”, properly understood (see Compliance Coal Corporation v. British Columbia (Environmental Assessment Office), 2020 BCSC 621, 13 L.C.R. (2d) 215, at para. 91). The line between a valid regulation and a constructive taking is crossed where the effect of the regulatory activity deprives a claimant of the use and enjoyment of its property in a substantial and unreasonable way, or effectively confiscates the property (Horsman and Morley, at § 5:2). Put simply, “in order for a Crown measure to effect a constructive taking of property, private rights in the property must be virtually abolished, leaving the plaintiff with ‘no reasonable use’ of the property” (Horsman and Morley, at § 5:13 (emphasis added)).

[20]                        A series of lower court judgments affirm that, in general, Canadian courts require a “total loss of the plaintiff’s interest in property for the Crown’s action to constitute a taking” (Horsman and Morley, at § 5:13; see also Lynch v. St. John’s (City), 2016 NLCA 35, 400 D.L.R. (4th) 62; Sun Construction Company Limited v. Conception Bay South (Town), 2019 NLSC 102, 87 M.P.L.R. (5th) 256). Courts have, therefore, dismissed claims for compensation where the regulation left the owner some reasonable use for the property (Genevieve Holdings Ltd. v. Kamloops (City) (1988), 42 M.P.L.R. 171 (B.C. Co. Ct.); Steer Holdings Ltd. v. Manitoba, 1992 CanLII 12840 (MB KB), [1992] 2 W.W.R. 558 (Man. Q.B.), aff’d (1992), 1992 CanLII 2773 (MB CA), 99 D.L.R. (4th) 61 (Man. C.A.); Purchase v. Terrace (City) (1995), 26 M.P.L.R. (2d) 126 (B.C.S.C.); Harvard Investments Ltd. v. Winnipeg (City) (1995), 1995 CanLII 11051 (MB CA), 129 D.L.R. (4th) 557 (Man. C.A.)).

[21]                        At common law, taking of property by the state must be authorized by law, and triggers a presumptive right to compensation which can be displaced only by clear statutory language showing a contrary intention — that is, an intention not to compensate (see P. A. Warchuk, “Rethinking Compensation for Expropriation” (2015), 48 U.B.C. L. Rev. 655, at pp. 656 and 678‑81). This was recognized in Attorney‑General v. De Keyser’s Royal Hotel, [1920] A.C. 508 (H.L.), wherein Lord Atkinson stated: “The recognized rule for the construction of statutes is that, unless the words of the statute clearly so demand, a statute is not to be construed so as to take away the property of a subject without compensation” (p. 542). Explaining the rule’s rationale, His Lordship cited to London and North Western Railway Co. v. Evans, [1893] 1 Ch. 16 (C.A.), at p. 28, per Bowen L.J., saying, at p. 542:

The Legislature cannot fairly be supposed to intend, in the absence of clear words shewing such intention, that one man’s property shall be confiscated for the benefit of others, or of the public, without any compensation being provided for him in respect of what is taken compulsorily from him. Parliament in its omnipotence can, of course, override or disregard this ordinary principle . . . if it sees fit to do so, but, it is not likely that it will be found disregarding it, without plain expressions of such a purpose.

Lord Parmoor agreed with Lord Atkinson that this rule was “well‑established” and that “justice requires that statutes should not be construed to enable the land of a particular individual to be confiscated without payment”, absent clear words to the contrary (De Keyser’s Royal Hotel, at pp. 576 and 579).

[22]                        It is important to stress that the rule contemplates that governments have the power to immunize themselves from liability to pay compensation for a taking. While, as we explain, we do not “expand” that liability but merely affirm it, the point is that governments may effect takings without paying compensation, so long as the enabling statute clearly expresses that intention. Notably, in CPR, the legislation at issue — the Vancouver Charter, S.B.C. 1953, c. 55 — immunized the City from compensating landowners for any loss as a result of the restrictions on land development and use (CPR, at paras. 12, 19 and 36‑37). From the standpoint of government, the exigencies of the rule are modest and easily satisfied.

[23]                        This Court first applied the rule in De Keyser’s Royal Hotel in Manitoba Fisheries Ltd. v. The Queen, 1978 CanLII 22 (SCC), [1979] 1 S.C.R. 101. Ritchie J., for the Court, cited this passage from Lord Radcliffe’s speech in Belfast Corporation v. O.D. Cars Ltd., [1960] A.C. 490 (H.L. (N.I.)), at p. 523, at p. 110, with approval:

On the one hand, there would be the general principle, accepted by the legislature and scrupulously defended by the courts, that the title to property or the enjoyment of its possession was not to be compulsorily acquired from a subject unless full compensation was afforded in its place. Acquisition of title or possession was “taking.” Aspects of this principle are found in the rules of statutory interpretation devised by the courts, which required the presence of the most explicit words before an acquisition could be held to be sanctioned by an Act of Parliament without full compensation being provided, or imported an intention to give compensation and machinery for assessing it into any Act of Parliament that did not positively exclude it. This vigilance to see that the subject’s rights to property were protected, so far as was consistent with the requirements of expropriation of what was previously enjoyed in specie, was regarded as an important guarantee of individual liberty. It would be a mistake to look on it as representing any conflict between the legislature and the courts. The principle was, generally speaking, common to both.

[24]                        That the rule in De Keyser’s Royal Hotel is one of common law answers Halifax’s submission that interpreting the protection narrowly against uncompensated takings avoids “creat[ing] a common law back door to constitutionalizing rights which were excluded deliberately from the Charter” (R.F., at paras. 108‑09). It is, of course, true that the framers of our Constitution did not include the protection of property rights in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (see Warchuk, at pp. 658‑59). But the Charter is not, and never has been, the sole source of Canadians’ rights against the state; in particular, the common law also affords protections of individual liberty. Nor is the scope of common law rights dependent on whether such rights are also entrenched in the Charter. While this follows as a matter of logic, s. 26 of the Charter itself affirms that “[t]he guarantee in this Charter of certain rights and freedoms shall not be construed as denying the existence of any other rights or freedoms that exist in Canada.”

[25]                        This legal backdrop brings us to CPR, and its elaboration of the common law rule in the form of a two-part test for showing a constructive taking: “. . . (1) an acquisition of a beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it, and (2) removal of all reasonable uses of the property . . .” (para. 30 (emphasis added), citing Mariner, at p. 716; Manitoba Fisheries; Tener). The issues present in this appeal require us to consider the meaning of a “beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it” under the first part of that test. In bringing greater clarity to this aspect of the CPR test, we do not change the doctrine of constructive takings, but simply apply it to the facts of the present dispute. As we will explain, the Court in CPR did not use “beneficial interest” in the technical sense that it carries in the domain of equity. Rather, a “beneficial interest” is to be more broadly understood as an “advantage” — hence the Court’s coupling of “beneficial interest” with the phrase “or flowing from [the property]”. Clearly, if the interest acquired by the state can be one which flows from the property, what must be shown by the property owner can fall short of an actual acquisition by the state.

[26]                        Further, we must also decide the relevance, if any, under the second part of the test of the public authority’s intended use of the land.

B.            “Beneficial Interest”

[27]                        The Court of Appeal, it will be recalled, held that the first part of the test stated in CPR — the “acquisition of a beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it” — requires Annapolis to show that Halifax actually acquired the Lands. Deciding whether this is so requires that we give meaning to the expression “beneficial interest”, as it was used in CPR. In our view, that meaning is best appreciated by considering the authorities upon which CPR relied in stating that condition, and especially this Court’s decisions in Manitoba Fisheries and Tener. As we will explain, doing so reveals that actual acquisition is not necessary; rather, the obtaining by Halifax of an advantage in respect of the Lands suffices.

(1)         Manitoba Fisheries

[28]                        Manitoba Fisheries Ltd. was a private commercial fishery. In 1969, Parliament enacted the Freshwater Fish Marketing Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. F‑13, which granted a federal Crown corporation a commercial monopoly on the export of fish from Manitoba, and delegated power to the corporation to grant licenses to private enterprises like Manitoba Fisheries to continue operating notwithstanding the Act. Manitoba Fisheries did not receive such a license, and eventually the constraints of the Act put Manitoba Fisheries out of business. In such circumstances, the Act required the federal government to transfer funds to the Province of Manitoba, which would then compensate affected businesses, such as Manitoba Fisheries. Manitoba, however, refused to compensate Manitoba Fisheries (pp. 103‑5).

[29]                        Significantly, the monopoly created by the Act conferred an economic advantage upon the state, but not an actual acquisition of property. It is true that, relying on Ulster Transport Authority v. James Brown & Sons, Ltd., [1953] N.I. 79 (C.A.), Ritchie J. held that Manitoba Fisheries’ loss of goodwill deprived the company of property that was acquired by the corporation (p. 110). But this rested on his view that the government had acquired an advantage through the acquisition of a statutory monopoly that entitled it to benefits that would otherwise have flowed to the company. This interpretation is made plain in Ritchie J.’s conclusion that “[goodwill] is the whole advantage, whatever it may be, of the reputation and connection of the firm”, and that the monopoly “completely extinguished” the appellant’s goodwill, leaving customers with no choice but to do business with the corporation (p. 107 (emphasis added)). In other words, the monopoly created by the Act restricted competition in the industry, thereby allowing the state to acquire all of the advantage that Manitoba Fisheries had previously enjoyed on the basis of its reputation and connections.

[30]                        Just as significantly, the Court was also concerned about the effect of the taking on the property holder. That effect — the loss of the business — was regarded as a taking or acquiring of Manitoba Fisheries’ business by the state (p. 118). A persuasive consideration for Ritchie J. was that, “[u]ntil the creation of the Corporation by the Act, persons wishing to purchase freshwater fish from Manitoba could purchase such fish from [Manitoba Fisheries] or other firms in the industry. After the creation of the Corporation such purchases could be made only from the Corporation or its agents” (p. 109). This led him to conclude: “Once it is accepted that the loss of the goodwill of the appellant’s business which was brought about by the Act and by the setting up of the Corporation was a loss of property and that the same goodwill was by statutory compulsion acquired by the federal authority, it seems to me to follow that the appellant was deprived of property which was acquired by the Crown” (p. 110).

[31]                        That the Court in Manitoba Fisheries ascribed significance to the effects on the property holder is underscored by Ritchie J.’s reliance on Ulster Transport Authority. The relevant passage cited Lord MacDermott’s observations in that case:

We are not dealing here with a “mere” prohibition or with a prohibition which is essentially regulatory in character. We are dealing with what I have held to be, according to the intention of the Legislature, a device for diverting a definite part of the business of furniture removers and storers from the respondents and others to the appellants. If that is right, the result must be the same whether section 5(1) of the Act of 1920 sounds in pith and substance or in effect or partly in one and partly in the other. Wherever else a prohibition directed to other ends might lead, the relevant prohibition cannot but constitute a taking if my views as to its effect and underlying intention are correct. [Emphasis added.]

 

(Ulster Transport Authority, at p. 116, as cited in Manitoba Fisheries, at p. 111.)

Adopting the reasoning in Ulster Transport Authority, Ritchie J. concluded that the impugned regulation “had the effect of depriving the appellant of its goodwill as a going concern and consequently rendering its physical assets virtually useless and that the goodwill so taken away constitutes property of the appellant for the loss of which no compensation whatever has been paid” (p. 118 (emphasis added)).

(2)         Tener

[32]                        The Court in Tener, as in Manitoba Fisheries, also focussed on the effect of a regulatory measure and the advantage acquired therefrom by the government. The Teners were the registered holders of mineral claims on lands later included in a provincial park. The Province of British Columbia imposed increasingly onerous conditions governing the exploitation of natural resources in the park, until the Teners were informed that no new exploration or development would be permitted, thus denying them the possibility of exploiting their mineral claims (pp. 536‑38 and 552). The central issue on appeal to this Court was whether the Teners were entitled to compensation under the relevant legislation.

[33]                        In finding for the Teners, Estey J., for the majority, revealed his concern that the regulation had the effect of (or, as he put it, “amount[ed] to”) securing an advantage by confining all reasonable uses of the property to the Province’s preferred use as a provincial park. As Estey J. explained, while there had been “no regulation qua minerals which reduced the value of these minerals or the opportunity of the respondents to remove them”, the “denial of access to these lands occurred under the Park Act and amounts to a recovery by the Crown of a part of the right granted to the respondents in 1937” (p. 563 (emphasis added)).

[34]                        Thus Estey J.’s analysis in Tener adhered closely to that in Manitoba Fisheries. The Teners retained their mineral rights. In securing the advantage of preserving “qualities perceived as being desirable for public parks” (p. 564) by regulating away the Teners’ ability to exercise those rights, the Province had effectively “recover[ed] [. . .] the right granted to the [Teners]” (p. 563).

[35]                        Wilson J., concurring in the result, focussed on the nature of the Teners’ interest. She described that interest as “in the nature of a profit à prendre comprising both the mineral claims and the surface rights necessary for their enjoyment” (p. 540). But the Province could not take the actual profit à prendre, being a registrable interest under British Columbia’s land registry system, without actually taking actual title. Hence Wilson J.’s emphasis that the holder of a profit à prendre “owns . . . mineral claims and the right to exploit them through the process of severance” (p. 541 (emphasis added; emphasis in original deleted)). So understood, the interest held by the Teners had not been actually acquired, since the Province did not itself obtain a right of exploitation. What the Province did acquire by preventing the Teners from exploiting their mineral rights was an advantage — specifically, preserving the land as a provincial park in the public interest.

[36]                        That the Province need not to have been shown to have actually acquired a proprietary interest for the Teners to establish a constructive taking, and that the focus is instead on the effect on the landowner of the advantage gained by the land use regulation, is highlighted by Wilson J.’s reasons:

In my view, this is a case of expropriation under s. 11(c) of the Park Act to which the Highways Act applies. I reach this conclusion on the basis that the absolute denial of the right to go on the land and sever the minerals so as to make them their own deprives the respondents of their profit à prendre. Their interest is nothing without the right to exploit it. The minerals in situ do not belong to them. Severance and the right of severance is of the essence of their interest.

 

. . .

 

While the grant or refusal of a licence or permit may constitute mere regulation in some instances, it cannot be viewed as mere regulation when it has the effect of defeating the respondents’ entire interest in the land. Without access the respondents cannot enjoy the mineral claims granted to them in the only way they can be enjoyed, namely by the exploitation of the minerals. [Emphasis added; p. 550.]

[37]                        We note that Wilson J. expressly rejected the Crown’s submission that “it is not enough to show that what the Crown did prevented the respondents from realizing on their interest or rendered it worthless” (p. 551). Instead, the Teners had to show “that the Crown has appropriated their interest to itself, that the interest which previously belonged to the respondents now belongs to the Crown” (p. 551).

(3)         Defining the Nature of a “Beneficial Interest”

[38]                        In our view, the foregoing jurisprudence — upon which the CPR test was expressly stated as resting — supports an understanding of “beneficial interest” as concerned with the effect of a regulatory measure on the landowner, and not with whether a proprietary interest was actually acquired by the government. Conversely, that same jurisprudence supports the view that “beneficial interest”, as that term appears in the first part of the test stated in CPR, refers not to actual acquisition of the equity that rests with the beneficial owner of property connoting rights of use and enjoyment, but to an “advantage” flowing to the state. We say this for two reasons.

[39]                        First, to require actual acquisition would collapse the distinction between constructive (de facto) and de jure takings — a distinction which CPR explicitly preserves (paras. 30‑37). Simply put, if a constructive taking requires an actual taking, then it is no longer constructive. It follows that the Court of Appeal’s requirement of an actual acquisition of the Annapolis Lands cannot be necessary to satisfy the CPR test for a constructive taking.

[40]                        Secondly, interpreting “beneficial interest” broadly (as meaning a benefit or advantage accruing to the state) ensures CPR’s coherence to Manitoba Fisheries and Tener, neither of which understood “benefits” in the strict equitable sense of that term. Again, the references to those authorities in CPR demonstrate that CPR merely sought to affirm, and not to alter, our law of constructive takings. This interpretation is supported by the explicit wording under the first part of the CPR test: “. . . a beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it . . .” (para. 30 (emphasis added)). An interest flowing from the property affirms that a “beneficial interest” can be more broadly understood as an advantage, and need not be an actual acquisition.

[41]                        To be clear, we are not “depart[ing] from precedent” (para. 111), as our colleagues contend. We aim to illuminate CPR, not overrule it. Our colleagues say that courts “have applied the CPR test without difficulty” (para. 112). With respect, this misses the point. The key question is whether the lower courts have applied the CPR test correctly. In our respectful view, many of them have not. Indeed, the Court of Appeal itself misapprehended the law in this case, by asserting that CPR requires an actual expropriation to establish a constructive taking. As we have explained, and as the authorities confirm, CPR — properly understood — trains the court’s eye on whether a public authority has derived an advantage, in effect, from private property, not on whether it has formally acquired a proprietary interest in the land. To hold otherwise would be to erase the long‑standing distinction between de jure and de facto expropriation from Canadian law.

[42]                        As a final observation, we acknowledge that, in addition to Manitoba Fisheries and Tener, the Court in CPR also cited to Mariner. But this does not affect our analysis. Mariner concerned the Province of Nova Scotia’s designation of privately owned land as a beach under a provincial statute that subjected it to stringent conservation regulations. When the Minister refused the respondents’ applications to build homes on the land, they sought a declaration that the Crown had expropriated their lands, entitling them to compensation. Cromwell J.A. (as he then was), writing for the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, held that the respondents’ loss of economic value did not amount to an advantage acquired by the provincial authority (see generally Mariner, at pp. 713‑16).

[43]                        Mariner illustrates that regulation alone will not satisfy the test for a constructive taking; there must be something more “beyond drastically limiting use or reducing the value of the owner’s property” (p. 716). When this threshold is crossed — that is, where all reasonable uses have been removed — a regulation may be, “in effect, confiscation” (p. 727 (emphasis added)). To be clear, Mariner does not stray from focussing on both the effect of the taking and the advantage acquired by the government, as required by this Court’s jurisprudence and affirmed in the test set out in CPR. Rather, and consistent with both Manitoba Fisheries and Tener, Mariner asked whether the effect of the regulation was to remove an interest in land (Mariner, at p. 722, referring to Tener).

(4)         Conclusion on “Beneficial Interest”

[44]                        In sum, we affirm that the test to show a constructive taking is that stated by CPR, properly understood. The reviewing court must decide: (1) whether the public authority has acquired a beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it (i.e. an advantage); and (2) whether the state action has removed all reasonable uses of the property. This gives effect to this Court’s acknowledgement of a common law right to compensation where the two-part CPR test is satisfied. It accords with imperatives of justice and fairness, which underpin the court’s assessment of expropriation claims, and remedies situations where cases do not neatly fit within the expropriation legislative framework and would otherwise “fall between the cracks” (Warchuk, at pp. 686 and 690).

[45]                        To this, we would add that, because the test focusses on effects and advantages, substance and not form is to prevail. A court deciding whether a regulatory measure effects a constructive taking must undertake a realistic appraisal of matters in the context of the specific case, including but not limited to:

(a)            The nature of the government action (i.e., whether it targets a specific owner or more generally advances an important public policy objective), notice to the owner of the restrictions at the time the property was acquired, and whether the government measures restrict the uses of the property in a manner consistent with the owner’s reasonable expectations;

(b)            The nature of the land and its historical or current uses. Where, for example, the land is undeveloped, the prohibition of all potential reasonable uses may amount to a constructive taking. That said, a mere reduction in land value due to land use regulation, on its own, would not suffice; and

(c)            The substance of the alleged advantage. The case law reveals that an advantage may take various forms. For example, permanent or indefinite denial of access to the property or the government’s permanent or indefinite occupation of the property would constitute a taking (Sun Construction, at para. 15). Likewise, regulations that leave a rights holder with only notional use of the land, deprived of all economic value, would satisfy the test. It could also include confining the uses of private land to public purposes, such as conservation, recreation, or institutional uses such as parks, schools, or municipal buildings.

C.            Disguised Expropriation in Quebec Civil Law

[46]                          The parties and several interveners invoked civil law authorities in this appeal. The conceptual similarities between the common law doctrine of constructive takings and the civil law doctrine of disguised expropriation have been highlighted by some authors (Lavoie, at pp. 241‑45; M.‑A. LeChasseur, “L’expropriation de facto au Canada et la transcendance des solidarités”, in Service de la qualité de la profession du Barreau du Québec, vol. 509, Développements récents en droit municipal (2022), 71; Y. Emerich, Droit commun des biens: perspective transsystémique (2017), at pp. 225‑27 and 235‑37). We refer to civil law principles “for the purpose of explanation and illustration”, bearing in mind that Quebec precedents serve as persuasive, rather than binding, authority (Farber v. Royal Trust Co., 1997 CanLII 387 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 846, at para. 32; see also C.M. Callow Inc. v. Zollinger, 2020 SCC 45, at para. 58). To be clear, our analysis does not disregard the distinct features of the respective doctrines from either legal tradition (Callow, at para. 158, per Brown J., concurring).

[47]                        The doctrine of disguised expropriation in Quebec civil law is founded upon art. 952 of the Civil Code of Québec (“C.C.Q.”): “No owner may be compelled to transfer his ownership except by expropriation according to law for public utility and in return for a just and prior indemnity.” Article 952 establishes a presumption against uncompensated expropriation by the state, as does the common law through the rule in De Keyser’s Royal Hotel, as we have explained (P.‑A. Côté, in collaboration with S. Beaulac and M. Devinat, The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada (4th ed. 2011), at pp. 511‑13). In the context of municipal regulations, an owner subject to disguised expropriation may challenge the validity or operability of the bylaw under administrative law principles or, alternatively, claim an indemnity for disguised expropriation under art. 952 (Lorraine, at para. 2; S. Pelletier and F. Côté, “Développements récents en matière d’expropriation déguisée: distinction entre les recours en nullité, en dommages pour responsabilité extracontractuelle d’un organisme public et en expropriation déguisée”, in Service de la qualité de la profession du Barreau du Québec, vol. 468, Développements récents en droit de l’environnement (2019), 303).

[48]                        Quebec courts have recognized that art. 952 C.C.Q. establishes a no-fault liability scheme for disguised expropriation, in contrast to administrative law challenges to the validity of a bylaw based on the municipality’s improper motive (see Ville de Léry v. Procureure générale du Québec, 2019 QCCA 1375, at para. 17; Montréal (Ville) v. Benjamin, 2004 CanLII 44591 (Que. C.A.), at para. 57; Ville de La Prairie v. 9255-2504 Québec inc., 2020 QCCS 307, 2020 CarswellQue 2737 (WL), at para. 29; Spénard v. Salaberry-de-Valleyfield (Cité de), [1983] C.S. 725). It is now well established in the jurisprudence on disguised expropriation that the criterion applicable to such claims is whether the state action [translation] “remov[es] all reasonable uses of the immovable” (Dupras v. Ville de Mascouche, 2022 QCCA 350, at para. 27 (CanLII); see also Wallot v. Québec (Ville), 2011 QCCA 1165, 24 Admin. L.R. (5th) 306, at para. 42; Municipalité de Saint‑Colomban v. Boutique de golf Gilles Gareau inc., 2019 QCCA 1402, at para. 64; Meadowbrook Groupe Pacific inc. v. Ville de Montréal, 2019 QCCA 2037, 2019 CarswellQue 12262 (WL), at para. 29; Ville de Québec v. Rivard, 2020 QCCA 146, at para. 64; Ville de Saint-Rémi v. 9120‑4883 Québec inc., 2021 QCCA 630, at para. 25 (CanLII)). For this reason, disguised expropriation under art. 952 C.C.Q. requires no element analogous to the “acquisition” branch of the CPR test. A bylaw that removes all reasonable uses of the property suffices, on its own, to effect a disguised expropriation in Quebec civil law.

[49]                        There are, however, exceptions that permit us to compare disguised expropriation to constructive takings at common law. The Quebec Court of Appeal’s decision in Benjamin provides one such example. In that case, the owner’s claim based on the decades‑old bylaw was prescribed. But the Court of Appeal held that [translation] “in the very particular circumstances of this case” (para. 62), the combination of zoning restrictions and the City’s use of the land as an extension of its park justified awarding an indemnity for disguised expropriation (paras. 65 and 82).

[50]                        The criteria applied by the Quebec Court of Appeal in Benjamin “pla[y] a functionally similar role” (Bhasin v. Hrynew, 2014 SCC 71, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 494, at para. 44) to the “deprivation” and “acquisition” requirements of the CPR test. Accordingly, and as we discuss below, we regard Benjamin and analogous Quebec cases as having persuasive authority in assessing constructive taking claims. These rulings, we emphasize, are useful for illustrative purposes only in applying the CPR test. In this case, we need not draw on Quebec authorities to fill a doctrinal gap in the common law or to modify or otherwise develop existing legal rules (Callow, at para. 123, per Brown J., concurring, and para. 191, per Côté J., dissenting).

D.           Intention

[51]                        The courts below disagreed on whether the intention of a public authority is relevant to the analysis of constructive taking claims. The motion judge, at para. 35, cited this Court’s definition of disguised expropriation articulated in Lorraine, at para. 2, which included “an ulterior motive”, and concluded that this was equally applicable to finding a constructive taking at common law (para. 36). The Court of Appeal, however, held that “[m]otive is not a material fact in the context of a [constructive] expropriation claim” (para. 82).

[52]                        Respectfully said, neither position is correct. The public authority’s intention is not an element of the test for constructive takings at common law. Again, the mischief addressed by the doctrine is one of advantage and effects, not that a public authority acted in bad faith or with an otherwise ulterior motive. Indeed, this Court held in CPR that, even if the City’s purpose were to “enable the inhabitants to use the corridor for walking and cycling,” its bylaw, in effect, neither encouraged trespassing nor prevented the historical and current use of the land (para. 33) and therefore could not be said to have deprived the landowner of all reasonable uses.

[53]                        This does not mean, however, that intention is irrelevant to the inquiry. Indeed, the case law we discuss below suggests that the objectives pursued by the state may be some evidence of constructive taking. Stated differently, the intention to take constructively, if proven by the claimant, may support a finding that the landowner has lost all reasonable uses of their land (inasmuch as a finding of this effect can be supported by evidence that such an effect was intended). But the absence of evidence of the state’s intention does not preclude a property holder’s claim. It follows that intent may constitute a “material fact” in the context of a constructive taking claim. We stress, however, that the focus of the inquiry must remain on the effects of state action.

[54]                        A brief review of the jurisprudence illustrates the supporting role of intention in assessing constructive taking claims. In Manitoba Fisheries, at p. 111, as we have already recalled, Ritchie J. endorsed a passage from Ulster Transport Authority highlighting the relevance of intention in constructive taking cases. The key portion of this passage merits repeating: “. . . the relevant prohibition cannot but constitute a taking if my views as to its effect and underlying intention are correct” (emphasis added). Thus the objective pursued by the state was considered (Ulster Transport Authority, at pp. 113 and 116; Manitoba Fisheries, at pp. 111‑13) in distinguishing between a mere regulatory prohibition and the constructive taking of a business through the establishment of a public monopoly.

[55]                        Likewise, in Lynch — which Halifax acknowledges was correctly decided — the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador treated the City’s intention in refusing to allow any development on the subject watershed land as germane to whether a constructive taking had occurred. In concluding it had, the court referred to the City’s express intention “to take away the Lynches’ right to appropriate the groundwater on their land” so as to secure the City’s “right to a continuous flow of uncontaminated groundwater downstream to [its] water facilities” (para. 60). Moreover, the City took the view that securing this objective required the prohibition of “all activity on the Lynch property” (para. 62). The City’s intention, as implemented by its officials, thus indicated that the land in issue had been constructively taken.

[56]                        The Quebec Court of Appeal’s decision in Benjamin further illustrates how intent may support a finding of a constructive taking. There, a zoning bylaw designated the claimant’s property as a “park”, and the City [translation] “knowingly” used the land in issue as an extension of its own park for 14 years (para. 50). The City — inadvertently at first — installed a fence and lampposts and created a trail on the claimant’s land, which was effectively incorporated into an adjacent public park. The City then manifested its intention to achieve that very effect by refusing to remove the fence after receiving a demand letter from the claimant. On appeal, the City offered to remove the fence and lampposts, but only if the claimant accepted to adequately maintain his own land for public safety. The Court of Appeal characterized the City’s behaviour as an [translation] “abuse of right” and underscored its lack of “goodwill” to either formally expropriate the claimant’s land or permit reasonable uses thereof (paras. 49, 54 and 59). The plans transparently set out by the City thus indicated that the claimant would continue to be deprived of all reasonable uses of his land indefinitely. In these circumstances, the City’s intent buttressed the finding of disguised expropriation arising from the bylaw and the persistent use of the claimant’s land.

[57]                        In short, the underlying objective pursued by a public authority may provide supporting evidence for a constructive taking claim. But it is neither necessary nor sufficient. The case law indicates that the assessment of intent has proved helpful in distinguishing between mere regulations in the public interest and takings requiring compensation at common law. What ultimately matters, however, irrespective of matters of intent, is whether the state-imposed restrictions on the property conferred an advantage on the state that effectively amounts to a taking (Tener, at pp. 563‑65, per Estey J., and pp. 551‑52, per Wilson J.; Manitoba Fisheries, at p. 118).

E.            Application

[58]                        The foregoing explains why, in our respectful view, the Court of Appeal erred by granting Halifax’s application for summary judgment dismissing Annapolis’ constructive taking claim. While the Court of Appeal saw “nothing on the facts . . . that could be remotely considered to be a taking of the Annapolis Lands and a corresponding deprivation of all reasonable uses of the lands” (para. 85), as we have explained, it is well‑established in our law that zoning which effectively preserves private land as a public resource may constitute a “beneficial interest” flowing to the state, as contemplated in CPR, where it has the effect of removing all reasonable uses of that land. Further, we have already explained why the motion judge did not err by considering Halifax’s alleged intent with respect to the Annapolis Lands in his application of the CPR test.

[59]                        More specifically, we agree with the motion judge’s identification of the material facts to be determined (at paras. 25‑26 and 36), arising from:

•                        September, 2019 correspondence between counsel demonstrating [Halifax]’s denial of the allegations in the amended Statement of Claim at paras. 20, 21, 61, 71 and 79. (exhibits EE and FF)

•                        Signage erected on Annapolis’ property depicting [Halifax]’s logo on various trails. (exhibits AA, BB and 1)

•                        December 18‑23, 2008 The Coast article quoting [Halifax] employee Peter Bigelow “. . . the city staffer overseeing the park’s creation”. (exhibit U, p. 743 especially)

•                        Ms. Denty’s discovery evidence to the effect that when the 2006 [Planning Strategy] was finalized, the decision was made that Annapolis’ property would be treated as development lands, not parklands. (exhibit A, pp. 54, 55)

•                        [The Planning Strategy], clause 1.7.1 denoting what [Halifax] Council “shall consider”. “This ter[m] denotes the mandatory consideration of policy concepts but does not commit [Halifax] Council to the eventual adoption of policy in secondary planning strategies”. (exhibit D, p. 175)

•                        [The Planning Strategy], clause 3.1 and the discussion of “S‑2” and S‑3” the “Urban Settlement Designation Boundary”. (exhibit D, pp. 195, 196)

 

. . .

 

•                        Ms. Denty’s discovery evidence as per the transcript and the clarifications in [Halifax] counsel’s October 16, 2019 correspondence (exhibit C at p. 905 and exhibit A at pp. 859‑860).

 

. . .

 

. . . Mr. Hattie’s affidavit[, elements of which] “point to the possibility of an ulterior motive” on the part of [Halifax].

[60]                        The importance of making findings on these points flows from the motion judge’s correct legal conclusions that (1) a constructive taking need only have the effect of defeating the landowner’s reasonable use of land; and (2) the state’s intent may be relevant in assessing whether all reasonable uses of land has been removed.

[61]                        The Court of Appeal did not identify any legal error or “patent injustice” that would justify interfering with the motion judge’s decision to dismiss Halifax’s summary judgment motion on the basis of the foregoing triable issues (Coady v. Burton Canada Co., 2013 NSCA 95, 365 D.L.R. (4th) 172, at para. 19). At most, it can be said that the Court of Appeal merely disagreed with the motion judge’s exercise of discretion. This does not provide a sufficient basis for appellate intervention.

[62]                        Further, the Court of Appeal erred in its r. 13.04 analysis. In Shannex Inc. v. Dora Construction Ltd., 2016 NSCA 89, 58 C.L.R. (4th) 1, at para. 34, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal set out a five‑part sequential test on a r. 13.04 motion for summary judgment. The first part of the test asks whether the challenged pleading discloses a “genuine issue of material fact”, either pure or mixed with a question of law. If yes, it should not be determined by summary judgment.

[63]                        There was no need for the Court of Appeal to proceed beyond the first Shannex step. The motion judge correctly decided that Annapolis’ pleadings contain disputed material facts, mixed with questions of law, and the evidence before the motion judge failed to negate the existence of genuine issues of material fact for trial. We therefore see no basis on which to disturb the motion judge’s conclusion that Annapolis’ pleadings in support of its constructive taking claim disclose “vast issues of material fact to be determined” at trial (para. 25). Indeed, two disputed factual issues are particularly material to the CPR test.

(1)         Halifax’s Alleged Acquisition of a Beneficial Interest in the Annapolis Lands

[64]                        First, it is disputed whether Halifax is promoting the Annapolis Lands as a public park, for instance by encouraging public use and holding them out as a park, as Annapolis alleges. This disputed fact is material because, if proven, it would tend to support Annapolis’ claim that Halifax acquired a “beneficial interest” in the Lands, as we have explained it. Preserving a park in its natural state may constitute an advantage accruing to the state, thus satisfying the “acquisition” element of CPR.

[65]                        To be clear, we reject the Court of Appeal’s formalistic position that a public authority’s alleged encouragement and financial support of trespass can never amount to an acquisition of a beneficial interest. Several cases support the proposition that whether a public authority treats private lands as an extension of a public park is a key factor in assessing the acquisition requirement. For instance, in Benjamin, the Quebec Court of Appeal found that the City of Montréal’s knowing use of private land as a public park — entailing the installation of lampposts, a fence, and signage indicating the location of the “park” that included the subject lands — in conjunction with restrictive zoning, effectively constituted a “disguised expropriation” (paras. 65 and 82).

[66]                        Similarly, in Dupras v. Ville de Mascouche, 2020 QCCS 2538, the Quebec Superior Court held that the City had effectively expropriated the claimant’s lands by subjecting them to “conservation” zoning and treating them as if they were part of a public park. Notably, the City had (1) marked off trails, (2) added signage with park maps covering the subject land, (3) encouraged the public to use the lands on the park, and (4) taken out insurance to cover public recreational activities on the land (see paras. 137‑40). The Quebec Court of Appeal affirmed the Superior Court’s reasoning and dismissed the respondent city’s cross-appeal on the finding of disguised expropriation (2022 QCCA 350, at paras. 27‑40).

[67]                        A similar claim in Steer Holdings failed, but for reasons which distinguish it from the allegations here. In Steer Holdings, the Manitoba Court of Appeal held that no benefit was acquired where there was “no suggestion that people will be encouraged in any way to move from the nature park to the subject property” (p. 67). Moreover, the land was not adjacent to the provincial park. The Court of Appeal thus rejected the argument that the Province of Manitoba had effectively enlarged its park system.

[68]                        As we have explained, and as the cases confirm, the doctrine of constructive takings looks to the effects of state action; it does not require a formal acquisition of a proprietary interest by the state. The absence of such a proprietary interest does not preclude the argument that, in effect, Halifax has functionally treated the Annapolis Lands as if they were a park for the benefit of the public. If proven, this fact would support Annapolis’ claim that Halifax acquired a beneficial interest in its property. It is, therefore, plainly material.

(2)         Halifax’s Alleged Removal of All Reasonable Uses of the Annapolis Lands

[69]                        Second, it is disputed whether Halifax, by allegedly treating the Annapolis Lands as a public park, has eliminated all uses of the Lands except serviced development, which is conditional upon the approval of Annapolis’ secondary planning applications.

[70]                        This disputed fact is material because, if proven, it may arguably support Annapolis’ claim that it has lost all reasonable uses of its property. This would leave Annapolis to shoulder the burden of holding the Lands as a public park indefinitely, while Halifax enjoys the advantage of having the Lands reserved for its own purposes without having to pay compensation. It is notable that the Court of Appeal, after observing that “Annapolis’ reasonable uses of its lands have not changed”, failed to identify a single reasonable possible use of the property (para. 92; see Lynch, at para. 63).

[71]                        Further, the Court of Appeal’s reasoning — to which our colleagues subscribe — cuts against one of the core lessons from Mariner, being to look to “the actual application of the regulatory scheme as opposed simply to its potential for interference with the owner’s activities” (p. 718 (emphasis added)). In concluding that there had been no taking in the present case, the Court of Appeal leaned heavily on the fact that the zoning rules had not changed, such that Annapolis’ land use rights remained the same after the release of the 2006 Planning Strategy. But the Court of Appeal neglected to consider Halifax’s application of the regulatory scheme as alleged by Annapolis. Indeed, Manitoba Fisheries, Tener, and Mariner all stand for the proposition that a regulation does not per se eliminate all reasonable uses of property where it provides a mechanism for permits, exemptions, or licenses to allow activities that are otherwise prohibited. In such cases, it is not the regulation alone that effects a constructive taking, but the application of that regulation to the land, including the manner in which the public authority refuses to grant the permit, exemption, or license (see Manitoba Fisheries, at p. 103 (taking of the goodwill resulting from the refusal by the Crown corporation to grant a license or exemption for the export of fish); Tener, at pp. 564‑65 (Crown’s notice denying a permit to conduct development work found to be an “expropriation” of the mineral rights)). In sum, “[w]hen . . . the claim is that the impact of a regulatory scheme has, in effect, taken away all rights of ownership, it is not the existence of the regulatory authority that is significant, but its actual application to the lands” (Mariner, at p. 729 (emphasis in original)). Therefore, the Court of Appeal erred in focussing solely on the “longstanding zoning status quo for the Lands” (R.F., at para. 18) since the passing of the Halifax Mainland Land Use By‑Law in 2006.

[72]                        According to Annapolis, Halifax has repeatedly refused to initiate the secondary planning process which could lead to the re-zoning of the Annapolis Lands. If Annapolis can prove at trial that Halifax is unlikely to ever grant secondary planning approval, this is clearly material to its constructive taking claim. In our view, all reasonable uses of land may be shown to have been eliminated where a permit needed to make reasonable use of the land is refused, such that the state has effectively taken away all rights of ownership.

[73]                        We note our colleagues’ characterization of Halifax’s alleged conduct as a mere “refusal to up-zone” which did not affect the reasonable uses of the Annapolis Lands. Our colleagues say that Halifax’s alleged conduct “simply disappointed” Annapolis’ hopes of cashing in on a speculative investment (para. 145). For several reasons, we respectfully reject this view.

[74]                        First, Annapolis did not acquire the Lands as a “speculative bet” (para. 145). Annapolis acquired most of the Lands in 1956, slowly adding to its holdings over time. Crucially, Halifax did not regulate land use in the relevant area prior to 1982. In other words, nothing prevented Annapolis from developing the Lands when they were first acquired. The conduct alleged is therefore not a mere “refusal to up‑zone”, as our colleagues say (para. 115). Annapolis originally had the right to use the Lands at its discretion. It now alleges that Halifax eliminated this right and thereby secured a public advantage without compensation.

[75]                        Secondly, and again with respect, our colleagues incorrectly characterize our position as an assertion that a “refusal to up‑zone vacant land” is tantamount to a constructive taking (para. 151). A refusal to up-zone, standing alone, will not generally remove all reasonable uses of vacant land. As we have explained, Halifax’s alleged conduct in this case is more than a mere refusal to up‑zone. Annapolis claims that Halifax has effectively transformed its Lands into a public park. We emphasize, however, that Halifax may defeat Annapolis’ constructive taking claim by showing a single reasonable use of the property.

[76]                        In this regard, it is telling that our colleagues do not identify any reasonable use of the Annapolis Lands. The mere (theoretical) possibility for Annapolis to lease the lands is not indicative of any reasonable use of the property — as our colleagues implicitly recognize in discussing Benjamin. As they acknowledge, the City in Benjamin “render[ed] any use of the land practically impossible” (para. 139), despite the absence of any restrictions on leasing. In any event, it is not realistic to assert that Annapolis may lease lands which, according to its allegations, are already used as a public park by Halifax.

[77]                        Moreover, in most cases, a public authority will not benefit from a refusal to up‑zone vacant land. As such, even if all reasonable uses of land are eliminated by a zoning refusal, the first element of the CPR test for a constructive taking would not ordinarily be met. Accordingly, we cannot agree with our colleagues that our approach “dramatically expands the potential liability of municipalities engaged in land use regulation” (para. 115). To the contrary, our approach is firmly rooted in the common law and does not encroach on the general rule that a refusal to up‑zone does not itself effect a constructive taking.

[78]                        Lastly, we reiterate that provincial legislatures remain free, as they always have been, to “alter the common law” in respect of constructive takings (CPR, at para. 37, referring to the immunity conferred by s. 569 of the Vancouver Charter) — by, in this case, immunizing Halifax by statute from the obligation to pay compensation for taking private property in the public interest.

[79]                        In light of the foregoing, the Court of Appeal erred in striking Annapolis’ claim related to the alleged constructive taking. There are genuine issues of material fact to be tried.

VI.         Disposition

[80]                        We would allow the appeal, set aside the Court of Appeal’s partial summary judgment order, and restore the motion judge’s order dismissing Halifax’s motion for partial summary judgment, with costs throughout. Annapolis’ claim against Halifax, in its entirety, may proceed to trial.

                  Kasirer and Jamal JJ. —

I.               Overview

[81]                        We have had the advantage of reading the reasons of our colleagues Côté and Brown JJ. With respect for their views, we conclude that the appeal should be dismissed.

[82]                        This Court summarized the test for a de facto (or constructive) taking at common law in its unanimous decision in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Vancouver (City), 2006 SCC 5, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 227 (“CPR”), at para. 30, per McLachlin C.J.:

For a de facto taking requiring compensation at common law, two requirements must be met: (1) an acquisition of a beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it, and (2) removal of all reasonable uses of the property (see Mariner Real Estate Ltd. v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General) (1999), 1999 NSCA 98 (CanLII), 177 D.L.R. (4th) 696 (N.S.C.A.), at p. 716; Manitoba Fisheries Ltd. v. The Queen, 1978 CanLII 22 (SCC), [1979] 1 S.C.R. 101; and The Queen in Right of British Columbia v. Tener, 1985 CanLII 76 (SCC), [1985] 1 S.C.R. 533).

[83]                        Annapolis Group Inc. has asked this Court to depart from this precedent. It urges the Court to allow its appeal from the order of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal granting partial summary judgment dismissing its claim against Halifax Regional Municipality for a de facto taking of its lands. Annapolis invited — and needs — this Court to depart from CPR for its claim to proceed to trial.

[84]                        Our colleagues Côté and Brown JJ. have accepted Annapolis’ invitation and propose to change the CPR precedent in two respects. We respectfully disagree with the changes they propose and how they apply the law in this case.

[85]                        First, we disagree with our colleagues’ view that the first element of the CPR test — which requires “an acquisition of a beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it” — should be replaced with the much broader notion of an “advantage”, whether or not “a proprietary interest was actually acquired by the government” (see paras. 4, 25, 27, 38, 40 and 44‑45). Our colleagues’ reformulation involves an unwarranted departure from CPR and significantly expands the potential liability of public authorities when regulating land use in the public interest. In our view, this Court should retain the CPR test for a de facto taking, which insists that a proprietary interest be acquired. Courts across common law Canada have applied this test without difficulty.

[86]                        Second, we disagree with our colleagues’ view that a public authority’s “intention” is a material fact in a claim for a de facto taking (para. 53). This is also an unwarranted departure from CPR and this Court’s prior jurisprudence. The material facts for a de facto taking claim concern the effects of the public authority’s regulatory activity, not its intention.

[87]                        Here, Annapolis’ de facto taking claim arises from Halifax’s refusal to “up‑zone” (in French: “procéder à un rezonage pour usage plus intensif”) land — to re-zone to enlarge the permissible uses of land, in this case so that Annapolis may commercially develop the land for housing — in connection with about 1,000 acres of vacant and treed land owned by Annapolis (“Annapolis Lands”). Annapolis’ proposed use for commercial development is impermissible and has been impermissible for many years. Annapolis now alleges that a Halifax municipal council resolution in 2016 refusing to up-zone the land to permit development — a regular occurrence in municipalities across Canada — and Halifax’s alleged acts of trespass in encouraging the public to hike, canoe, and swim on the lands, give rise to claims for de facto taking, abuse of public office, and unjust enrichment.

[88]                        The claims for abuse of public office and unjust enrichment are proceeding to trial, and, if the court finds Halifax liable, it may award a remedy. If Annapolis succeeds, it will be compensated for the harm occasioned by this conduct. But these matters are distinct from the question of whether Annapolis has alleged facts that would substantiate a claim for de facto taking under the applicable common law rules. The only issue on this appeal is whether the claim for de facto taking should also proceed to trial.

[89]                        The Nova Scotia Supreme Court declined to grant partial summary judgment on the de facto taking claim because the law could change through “creative interpretations on what may constitute a taking” and because a public authority’s intention may be relevant to a de facto taking claim (2019 NSSC 341, 17 L.C.R. (2d) 1, paras. 42 and 36). The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and granted partial summary judgment (2021 NSCA 3, 455 D.L.R. (4th) 349). It ruled that the evidence on the motion, seen in light of CPR and prior jurisprudence, establish no material fact in dispute either that Halifax has acquired a proprietary interest or that Annapolis has lost all reasonable uses of its lands. The Court of Appeal also ruled that intention is not a material fact for a de facto taking claim.

[90]                        In our view, this appeal should be dismissed. There is no material fact in dispute on either branch of the CPR test for a de facto taking. First, Halifax has acquired no beneficial interest in the Annapolis Lands or flowing from them. It has simply refused to up-zone the lands. Second, the uncontradicted evidence is that Annapolis has been deprived of no reasonable uses — let alone all reasonable uses — of its lands. The zoning and uses of the Annapolis Lands remain entirely unchanged. The lands remain vacant and treed, just as they have been since Annapolis acquired them. Importantly, the Court of Appeal rightly recalled that pursuant to the judgment of this Court in CPR, a public authority’s improper motive is not a factor in the analysis and cannot make up for a failure to establish the two settled requirements for a claim of de facto taking. Accordingly, partial summary judgment was properly granted dismissing the de facto taking claim as the claim has no real chance of success in law.

[91]                        Annapolis’ core claim is that Halifax’s refusal to up-zone its land to permit residential development, along with the fact that Halifax acted deliberately to secure the advantage of using the Annapolis Lands as a public park, constitutes a de facto taking. However, a refusal to up-zone, in the circumstances of this case, cannot establish a de facto taking unless this Court departs from the common law requirements that Halifax has acquired a beneficial interest involving the property and that Halifax has removed all reasonable uses of the property. We decline to alter the settled law to allow Annapolis to proceed with its claim. We are respectfully of the view that by acceding to Annapolis’ plea to set aside this Court’s decision in CPR as a governing precedent, our colleagues’ opinion risks radically changing the complexion of municipal planning law by providing, in like up-zoning contexts, a windfall to developers who speculate at municipal taxpayers’ expense.

II.            Background

[92]                        We take no issue with our colleagues’ summary of the factual background and the decisions below, but we wish to highlight the precise conduct of Halifax that Annapolis alleges constitutes a de facto taking: (1) refusing to up-zone the Annapolis Lands and to zone the lands as a park, and (2) encouraging the public to trespass.

[93]                        Between the 1950s and 2014, Annapolis, a real estate development company, acquired the Annapolis Lands, consisting of about 1,000 acres of vacant and treed land. Annapolis hoped to develop the lands into residential communities and to sell the development for a profit. The Annapolis Lands — which are still vacant and treed — are next to the Blue Mountain‑Birch Cove Lakes Wilderness Area, a large wilderness area protected under the Wilderness Areas Protection Act, S.N.S. 1998, c. 27.

[94]                        In 2006, Halifax adopted a “Regional Municipal Planning Strategy” as a policy statement to guide land development in the municipality. This policy, essentially a vision statement of long-term property development in the municipality, was adopted under the Municipal Government Act, S.N.S. 1998, c. 18, and the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter, S.N.S. 2008, c. 39 (“Halifax Charter”). Both statutes require Halifax to put in place a municipal planning strategy containing “statements of policy” to “guide the development and management of the municipality”, including “the future use, management and development of lands within the municipality” (Municipal Government Act, ss. 212 to 214; Halifax Charter, ss. 227 to 229). Both statutes also expressly provide that “[t]he adoption of a municipal planning strategy does not commit the council to undertake any of the projects suggested in it” (Municipal Government Act, s. 217(2); Halifax Charter, s. 232(2) (emphasis added to both statutes)).

[95]                        Under Halifax’s 2006 Regional Municipal Planning Strategy, about a third of the Annapolis Lands are designated “Urban Settlement”, which means they could be developed for serviced residential communities within 25 years. The remaining two‑thirds of the Annapolis Lands are designated “Urban Reserve”, which means they could be developed after 25 years. Serviced development on the Annapolis Lands cannot occur, however, unless Halifax adopts a municipal resolution authorizing a “secondary planning process” and amends its zoning by-law to allow residential development.

[96]                        Starting in 2007, Annapolis urged Halifax to take these legislative measures to permit Annapolis to build residential communities on the lands. Halifax has consistently refused to do so, preferring to maintain the status quo. In 2016, Halifax adopted a municipal resolution stating that it would not authorize a secondary planning process on the Annapolis Lands “at this time”.

[97]                        The 2016 municipal resolution refusing to up-zone the lands to permit development led to this litigation. In 2017, Annapolis sued Halifax for over $120 million for the alleged de facto taking of its lands and for abuse of public office and unjust enrichment.

[98]                        Only the de facto taking claim is in issue on this appeal. Annapolis alleges that Halifax refused to up-zone the lands because it intends to use them for a park and that Halifax has encouraged the public to trespass on the lands to hike, canoe, and swim. Annapolis also claims that Halifax has refused to zone the lands as a park because it would otherwise have a statutory obligation to buy the lands within a year (see Municipal Government Act, s. 222; Halifax Charter, s. 237). Annapolis’ key allegations of de facto taking are set out in its amended statement of claim, dated March 22, 2017, at paras. 111‑12:

[Halifax] has de facto expropriated the Annapolis Lands for public use as a park. [Halifax] has delayed and obstructed all of Annapolis’ attempts to develop the Annapolis Lands, and likewise, has deliberately avoided expressly zoning the Annapolis Lands to avoid its compensation obligation. In doing so, it has obtained the use of the Annapolis Lands as a public park, and has deprived Annapolis of any use of the Annapolis Lands.

 

Indeed, [Halifax] encourages members of the public to use the Annapolis Lands as a park. In addition to a variety of other outdoor activities, members of the public hike, cycle, canoe, camp, and swim on the Annapolis Lands as if [Halifax] held the Annapolis Lands as a park.

 

(A.R., vol. I, at p. 146)

[99]                        As we will explain, none of these pleaded acts, alone or in combination, amount to a de facto taking.

III.         Law

A.           This Court Should Not Depart From the CPR Test for De Facto Taking

(1)         Introduction

[100]                     Our colleagues state that the test for a de facto taking is set out in this Court’s decision in CPR, when “properly understood” (para. 44). Respectfully, our colleagues then depart from CPR by inappropriately extending CPR’s acquisition requirement — that the public authority’s regulatory actions result in the “acquisition of a beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it” — to encompass any “advantage” accruing to the public authority, whether or not what is acquired is proprietary and whether or not what is acquired corresponds to what is removed. Our colleagues depart from precedent and change the common law even though courts across common law Canada have applied CPR without difficulty and no court has expressed concern that the law is uncertain or unclear.

[101]                     Our colleagues derive this understanding of the acquisition requirement by parsing CPR and the authorities cited by McLachlin C.J., even though she referred to “a beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it” rather than a mere “advantage”. By stretching the acquisition requirement, our colleagues go some way towards endorsing Annapolis’ request that this Court should “revisit the CPR test due to the confusion caused by the concept of ‘acquisition of a beneficial interest in property or flowing from it’” (A.F. in response to interveners, at para. 27). Annapolis urged this Court to abandon CPR’s acquisition requirement because it was “a new element”, “a departure from historical jurisprudence”, and “not a required part of the test” (A.F., at paras. 36, 45 and 52). According to Annapolis, “a taking does not require an acquisition” (A.F., at para. 59; see also para. 66).

[102]                     Annapolis cited, among other authorities, the views of several commentators in support of its position that “this Court’s analysis in CPR, if taken literally, effectively abolishes liability for de facto taking” (A.F., at para. 9; see also paras. 35 and 52). Annapolis asserted that CPR should be “confined to its facts” (A.F., at para. 36) and pointed to similar commentary suggesting that this Court was mistaken in including the acquisition of a beneficial interest as part of the test (A.F., at paras. 89‑92). Annapolis further criticized CPR by submitting that de facto taking can be satisfied by government conduct without there necessarily having been an acquisition of anything (A.F., at para. 62).

[103]                     We respectfully disagree with our colleagues’ proposed departure from the acquisition requirement as framed in CPR. By subverting the acquisition requirement, our colleagues effectively accede to the request of the intervener the Canadian Constitution Foundation that this Court “revisit” the CPR test by focusing on “the effect of the government measure on the rights of the owner, not what was acquired by the government”, so that the acquisition requirement in CPR becomes “largely superfluous” (I.F., at paras. 6 and 9).

[104]                     As we explain below, under CPR and the cases it cited, there is a de facto taking only if there is both an acquisition and a corresponding deprivation of a proprietary interest removing all reasonable uses of the property. We also disagree with our colleagues’ claim, at para. 38, that the “beneficial interest” language of the acquisition requirement is concerned with the effect of a regulatory measure on the landowner and not with whether a proprietary interest was acquired by the public authority. While a de facto taking claim is concerned with the effect of a regulatory measure on the landowner, that concern is reflected in the removal requirement. The removal requirement is distinct from the acquisition requirement, which focuses on whether the public authority acquired a proprietary interest. Moreover, contrary to Annapolis’ position, CPR maintains the distinction between de jure and de facto takings: a de jure taking involves the acquisition of legal title (such as when a public authority invokes the statutory expropriation framework), while a de facto taking involves the acquisition of a proprietary interest without legal title.

(2)         A De Facto Taking Requires the Acquisition of and a Corresponding Deprivation of a Proprietary Interest

[105]                     CPR and the cases it cited — Manitoba Fisheries Ltd. v. The Queen, 1978 CanLII 22 (SCC), [1979] 1 S.C.R. 101, The Queen in Right of the Province of British Columbia v. Tener, 1985 CanLII 76 (SCC), [1985] 1 S.C.R. 533, and Mariner Real Estate Ltd. v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), 1999 NSCA 98, 177 D.L.R. (4th) 696 — illustrate how the test for a de facto taking should be applied. In two of these cases, the de facto taking claim was accepted (Manitoba Fisheries and Tener); in the other two cases, the claim was rejected (Mariner and CPR). We will briefly discuss each case.

(a)           Manitoba Fisheries

[106]                     In Manitoba Fisheries, this Court held that federal legislation granting a fish export monopoly to a Crown corporation, which resulted in putting a private fish export company out of business, amounted to a de facto taking of the company’s goodwill. The Court found that the company’s goodwill was “property” (pp. 110 and 118). The legislation involved a de facto (but not a de jure) taking because it had “the effect” of depriving the company of its goodwill and transferring it to the Crown corporation (p. 118). The legislation resulted in the company losing all reasonable uses of its goodwill and caused the “obliteration” of its “entire business” (p. 115). The Court also emphasized the correspondence between the acquisition and the deprivation: the company’s lost goodwill was “the same goodwill” that was “by statutory compulsion acquired by the federal authority”; the company was thus “deprived of property which was acquired by the Crown” (p. 110).

(b)         Tener

[107]                     In Tener, this Court held that the Crown in right of British Columbia engaged in a de facto taking by refusing to grant park use permits to the owners of registered mineral claims within a provincial park. The effect of refusing the permits was that the mineral rights could not be exploited through extraction. Estey J., for the majority, determined that the Crown’s actions deprived the owners of their ability to access and extract the minerals, a “right” and “property interest” the Crown had granted to them by giving them title to the mineral claims (pp. 553‑54 and 556‑57). The Crown had effectively recovered part of the property right by denying access (p. 563). The owners thus retained legal title to a property interest (the registered mineral claims), but that interest was rendered virtually useless. A de facto (but not a de jure) taking was made out. The mineral extraction right, though legally retained, was effectively lost by the owners of the registered claims and effectively recovered by the Crown. The deprivation thus corresponded to the acquisition.

(c)           Mariner

[108]                     In Mariner, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal held that the province did not engage in a de facto taking of a claimant’s property on a provincial beach by refusing to allow the claimant to build single-family dwellings on the property. Cromwell J.A. (as he then was) affirmed that a de facto taking requires “an acquisition as well as a deprivation” (p. 732 (emphasis in original)). He stressed the proprietary nature of what must be acquired (pp. 730 and 732). Cromwell J.A. also highlighted that both Tener and Manitoba Fisheries required the acquisition to correspond to the deprivation: in Tener, “the Crown re-acquired in fact, though not in law, the mineral rights” (p. 731 (emphasis added)), while in Manitoba Fisheries, “[t]he crucial point . . . is that the asset which was, in effect, lost by [the private company] was the asset gained, in effect, by the new federal corporation” (p. 731 (emphasis added)). In Mariner, by contrast, there was no de facto taking. Cromwell J.A. held that the “the loss of economic value resulting from land use regulation is not a taking of land” (p. 700). The province had acquired nothing because of the regulatory designation of the property as a beach, and the claimant had not lost virtually all rights of ownership (p. 700). As Cromwell J.A. observed, “[i]n this country, extensive and restrictive land use regulation is the norm. Such regulation has, almost without exception, been found not to constitute compensable expropriation” (p. 713). He decided that, “what is, in form, regulation will be held to be expropriation only when virtually all of the aggregated incidents of ownership have been taken away” (p. 717).

(d)         CPR

[109]                     Finally, in CPR, this Court held that the City of Vancouver did not engage in a de facto taking of CPR’s land (a railway corridor) by enacting a by-law refusing to allow CPR to develop the land for residential and commercial uses. McLachlin C.J. determined that the City’s development freeze did not result in it acquiring any beneficial interest in CPR’s land; the freeze was simply an “assurance that the land will be used or developed in accordance with [the City’s] vision, without even precluding the historical or current use of the land” (para. 33). This was “not the sort of benefit” that could be construed as a taking (para. 33). Nor had the City removed all reasonable uses of CPR’s property, because CPR was not precluded from using the land to operate a railway — the only historical use — or from leasing the land or otherwise developing it as permitted by law (para. 34). Thus, CPR suffered no deprivation and the City enjoyed no acquisition. The claim for de facto taking failed.

(e)           Conclusion

[110]                     CPR and the authorities it cited show there is no de facto taking unless there is both the acquisition of a beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it and a removal of all reasonable uses of the property. The interest must be proprietary — not merely an “advantage” — and the acquisition must correspond to the deprivation. These requirements are confirmed by K. Horsman and G. Morley, eds., Government Liability: Law and Practice (loose‑leaf), at § 5:1, which our colleagues rely on (at paras. 18‑20): a “taking” is “the forcible acquisition by the Crown of privately owned property . . . for public purposes” (emphasis added). The authors also recognize that “[i]n takings law, only those rights that are proprietary and vested . . . are compensable” (§ 5:8) and that “Canadian law recognizes that governments have the ability to greatly restrict the potential uses of property without triggering a right to compensation” (§ 5:13).

(3)         There Is No Basis to Change the Common Law

[111]                     We believe our colleagues have provided no basis for this Court to depart from the acquisition requirement as framed in CPR. They do not suggest that such a departure from precedent is needed to keep the common law in step with the evolution of society, to clarify a legal principle, or to resolve any inconsistency in the law, which are some of the usual grounds justifying evolution of the common law (see Friedmann Equity Developments Inc. v. Final Note Ltd., 2000 SCC 34, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 842, at para. 42; R. v. Salituro, 1991 CanLII 17 (SCC), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 654, at pp. 668‑69 and 679).

[112]                     To the contrary, courts in common law Canada have applied the CPR test without difficulty. No court has expressed any concern that the test is unworkable or unnecessarily complex (see British Columbia: FortisBC Energy Inc. v. Surrey (City), 2013 BCSC 2382, 112 L.C.R. 89, at paras. 411 and 418‑19; Compliance Coal Corporation v. British Columbia (Environmental Assessment Office), 2020 BCSC 621, 13 L.C.R. (2d) 215, at paras. 92-101; Alberta: Genesis Land Development Corp. v. Alberta, 2009 ABQB 221, 471 A.R. 1, at paras. 127‑29 and 141‑42, aff’d 2010 ABCA 148, 477 A.R. 390; Kalmring v. Alberta, 2020 ABQB 81, 11 Alta. L.R. (7th) 177, at paras. 68 and 79‑82; Altius Royalty Corporation v. Alberta, 2021 ABQB 3, 23 Alta. L.R. (7th) 105, at paras. 27 and 44‑47, aff’d 2022 ABQB 255; Ontario: Club Pro Adult Entertainment Inc. v. Ontario (2006), 2006 CanLII 42254 (ON SC), 27 B.L.R. (4th) 227 (S.C.J.) (“Club Pro (S.C.J.)”), at paras. 77‑78 and 82, rev’d in part on other grounds 2008 ONCA 158, 42 B.L.R. (4th) 47; Railink Canada Ltd. v. Ontario (2007), 95 L.C.R. 17 (S.C.J.), at para. 19; Nova Scotia: Taylor v. Dairy Farmers of Nova Scotia, 2010 NSSC 436, 298 N.S.R. (2d) 116, at paras. 74 and 82‑85, aff’d 2012 NSCA 1, 311 N.S.R. (2d) 300; Newfoundland and Labrador: Lynch v. St. John’s (City), 2016 NLCA 35, 400 D.L.R. (4th) 62, at paras. 54‑63; Sun Construction Company Limited v. Conception Bay South (Town), 2019 NLSC 102, 87 M.P.L.R. (5th) 256, at paras. 13 and 15; Gosse v. Conception Bay South (Town), 2021 NLCA 23, 16 L.C.R. (2d) 123, at paras. 30 and 46; KMK Properties Inc. v. St. John’s (City), 2021 NLSC 122, 19 M.P.L.R. (6th) 150, at paras. 18, 40 and 47‑50; Federal Court: Dennis v. Canada, 2013 FC 1197, 114 L.C.R. 1, at paras. 21-24, aff’d 2014 FCA 232; Calwell Fishing Ltd. v. Canada, 2016 FC 312, at paras. 173 and 249‑52 (CanLII); Anglehart v. Canada, 2016 FC 1159, [2017] 2 F.C.R. 74, at paras. 160‑61, aff’d 2018 FCA 115, [2019] 1 F.C.R. 504; Yukon Territory: Northern Cross (Yukon) Ltd. v. Yukon (Energy, Mines and Resources), 2021 YKSC 3, 16 L.C.R. (2d) 1, at paras. 285 and 309, rev’d in part on other grounds 2021 YKCA 6, 79 C.C.L.T. (4th) 179). Our colleagues do not suggest that lower courts have applied the CPR test with difficulty but simply assert, without more, that “many” of these courts across Canada have applied the test incorrectly (para. 41).

[113]                     We also note that at least one court has declined to abandon CPR’s acquisition requirement as proposed by Annapolis here (Altius Royalty Corporation v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Alberta, 2022 ABQB 255, at para. 76 (CanLII)), while another has rejected the suggestion that CPR is inconsistent with Tener and Manitoba Fisheries and has affirmed that the “the law is very settled on this issue” (Club Pro (S.C.J.), at para. 78, per Spies J.).

[114]                     This confirms, in our view, that CPR is settled law and that there is no reason to change it.

(4)         Departing From CPR Will Expose Municipalities Across Canada to Significant Financial Liability in Regulating Land Use

[115]                     Our colleagues’ reformulation of the acquisition requirement and departure from CPR as precedent has significant ramifications. It dramatically expands the potential liability of municipalities engaged in land use regulation in the public interest and throws into question the settled law that a refusal to up-zone is not a de facto taking.

[116]                     For example, in Tener, at pp. 557 and 564, Estey J. affirmed that “[o]rdinarily, in this country, . . . compensation does not follow zoning either up or down. . . . The imposition of zoning regulation and the regulation of activities on lands . . . add nothing to the value of public property.”

[117]                     Similarly, in Mariner, at pp. 713 and 734, Cromwell J.A. stated that “[i]t is settled law . . . that the regulation of land use which has the effect of decreasing the value of the land is not an expropriation. . . . [O]rdinarily compensation does not follow zoning either up or down. . . . Development freezes have consistently been held not to give rise to rights of compensation”.

[118]                     This settled law, which our colleagues propose now to set aside, was helpfully summarized by E. C. E. Todd in The Law of Expropriation and Compensation in Canada (2nd ed. 1992), at pp. 22‑23:

By the imposition, removal or alteration of land use controls a public authority may dramatically increase, or decrease, the value of land by changing the permitted uses which may be made of it. In such a case, in the absence of express statutory provision to the contrary an owner is not entitled to compensation or any other remedy notwithstanding that subdivision approval or rezoning is refused or development is blocked or frozen pursuant to statutory planning powers in order, for example, to facilitate the future acquisition of the land for public purposes. [Footnotes omitted.]

See also S. E. Hamill, “Common Law Property Theory and Jurisprudence in Canada” (2015), 40 Queen’s L.J. 679, at p. 703 (“So long as the owner can continue to use their property as they always have, they cannot be considered to have suffered a legally recognizable loss”); S. M. Makuch, N. Craik and S. B. Leisk, Canadian Municipal and Planning Law (2nd ed. 2004), at p. 212 (“the courts would be well advised to remain true to their traditional approach, which is in keeping with the general assumptions of no compensation for planning decisions and of allowing municipalities to allocate the benefits and burdens of planning”).

B.            Intention Is Not a Material Fact for a Claim of De Facto Taking

[119]                     We are also of the respectful view that our colleagues further depart from precedent when they say that “intent may constitute a ‘material fact’ in the context of a constructive expropriation claim” (para. 53). This statement contradicts their affirmation that “[t]he public authority’s intention is not an element of the test for constructive takings at common law” (para. 52 (emphasis in original)) and that “the underlying objective pursued by a public authority . . . is neither necessary nor sufficient” (para. 57). In our view, intention is not an element of the test for a de facto or constructive taking; it is equally not a material fact supporting such a claim.

[120]                     Our colleagues seek to reconcile their inconsistent positions by saying that “the intention to take constructively, if proven by the claimant, may support a finding that the landowner has lost all reasonable uses of their land” (para. 53). Again, we disagree. Although the public authority’s intention may provide narrative background or context or may be relevant to an administrative law claim that its actions were ultra vires as having an improper purpose or being in bad faith (see Catalyst Paper Corp. v. North Cowichan (District), 2012 SCC 2, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 5, at para. 28; Mariner, at pp. 717‑18; CPR, at paras. 10‑37), it is not relevant to a de facto taking claim, which is concerned with the effect of the public authority’s actions, not with its intention.

[121]                     On our reading, none of the three authorities cited by our colleagues support their position that intention is a material fact for a de facto taking claim. Our colleagues first rely, at para. 54, on Ulster Transport Authority v. James Brown & Sons, Ltd., [1953] N.I. 79 (C.A.) (cited in Manitoba Fisheries), at pp. 113 and 116. But the issue in Ulster was whether legislation purporting to limit the business of furniture removers, properly interpreted, was ultra vires for effectively taking property without compensation, contrary to a statutory prohibition of such taking. The discussion of intention in Ulster concerned legislative intention, as objectively expressed, rather than the subjective intention or motive of the public authority responsible for the taking. MacDermott L.C.J. referred to “deliberate and intentional” drafting but asked what the “intention [of the legislation] was” and invoked the principle that “Parliament must be presumed to intend the necessary effect of its enactments” (p. 112). He added, at p. 114: “Whatever in fact [the Legislature’s] motives may have been, the intention of the Legislature, as gleaned from its terms, is what must guide the court . . . .”

[122]                     Second, our colleagues, at para. 55, rely on Lynch, at paras. 60 and 62, which considered whether the City of St. John’s refusal to permit development amounted to expropriation of the claimants’ property. The effect of the City’s action was to take away the claimants’ right to appropriate the groundwater from their property and to give the City a beneficial interest in the property, consisting of the right to a continuous flow of uncontaminated groundwater. The claimants’ property rights flowing from a Crown grant were thereby reduced. But neither the cited paragraphs nor the decision as a whole suggest that intention is a material fact for a de facto taking claim. The case concerned the effect of the City’s actions that “purported” to remove the claimants’ right to appropriate groundwater on their land (para. 60).

[123]                     Finally, our colleagues, at para. 56, rely on Montréal (Ville) v. Benjamin, 2004 CanLII 44591 (Que. C.A.), which considered whether a zoning by-law and the City of Montréal’s actions in fencing off the owner’s land to include it within a public park amounted to “disguised expropriation” under Quebec civil law. Our colleagues write that the City “manifested its intention” by refusing to remove various structures on the claimant’s land and its “intent buttressed the finding of disguised expropriation”. But our colleagues’ reference to the “manifested” intention shows that the proper focus is on the effect, or intention as expressed, rather than intention itself. And any intention that “buttressed” a finding of disguised expropriation only confirmed such a prior finding; it did not help establish that finding. In our respectful view, Benjamin does not support the relevance of intention to a de facto taking claim.

[124]                     The mention of [translation] “abuse of right” in Benjamin does not suggest otherwise. A “disguised expropriation” is in itself an abuse of power, because a municipal government that uses its regulatory power to deprive an owner of the enjoyment of their property acts in a manner inconsistent with the municipality’s delegated authority (Lorraine (Ville) v. 2646‑8926 Québec inc., 2018 SCC 35, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 577, at para. 27). This is how the expression “abuse of right”, mentioned in Benjamin, was used by the Court of Appeal of Quebec in Lorraine (2016 QCCA 1803, at para. 13) and has been subsequently interpreted (see Pillenière, Simoneau v. Ville de Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville, 2021 QCCS 4031, 19 M.P.L.R. (6th) 275, at para. 112). This analysis focuses on the effect of municipal action and does not suggest that intent or motive is required for a distinct cause of action seeking compensation for disguised expropriation.

[125]                     To the contrary, Quebec courts have expressly held that the public authority’s intention is irrelevant under the Quebec civil law of disguised expropriation. Disguised expropriation is based on art. 952 of the Civil Code of Québec, whose focus is the effect of the public authority’s actions. This was recently confirmed by the unanimous judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal in Dupras v. Ville de Mascouche, 2022 QCCA 350, at para. 29 (CanLII):

[translation] Moreover, the municipality’s good or bad faith — the wrongfulness of its conduct — is not relevant to the analysis; it is “the actual effect of the by‑law” that matters. This is why, when the Supreme Court used the concept of abuse to characterize disguised expropriation, it referred to abuse of the power to regulate in order to proceed, de facto, with an expropriation of property without paying the indemnity required in particular by article 952 of the Civil Code of Québec. The validity of the by‑law restricting land use therefore does not preclude the existence of disguised expropriation. [Emphasis added; footnotes omitted.]

[126]                     We also agree with the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal that this Court’s decision in Lorraine, at para. 2, does not support the motion judge’s view, at paras. 35‑36, that Halifax’s alleged “ulterior motive” is relevant to the de facto taking claim. The Quebec Court of Appeal correctly explained the import of Lorraine in Dupras in the passage quoted above: “. . . when the Supreme Court used the concept of abuse to characterize disguised expropriation, it referred to abuse of the power to regulate in order to proceed, de facto, with an expropriation of property without paying the indemnity required in particular by article 952 of the Civil Code of Québec”. We accordingly disagree with the view of the motion judge and Annapolis that Lorraine supports the relevance of motive to a disguised expropriation claim — a view that even our colleagues refrain from endorsing.

[127]                     That said, we do not quarrel with our colleagues’ general remarks, at paras. 47-48, on the Quebec law of disguised expropriation. We note, however, that while our colleagues describe disguised expropriation under art. 952 of the Civil Code of Québec as a “no-fault liability scheme”, what the Quebec authorities mean by this is that fault, in the sense of bad faith, improper purpose, or improper motive, is not required. Nevertheless, the test for disguised expropriation remains extremely onerous: there must be an absolute negation of the exercise of the right of ownership, rendering its use impossible or equivalent to an actual confiscation of the property. As the Quebec Court of Appeal explained when referencing absence of fault in Ville de Léry v. Procureure générale du Québec, 2019 QCCA 1375, at para. 17:

[translation] However, absence of fault in the development of government objectives does not mean that there is no legal relationship between the appellant and the respondent, if what it alleges is shown. In Wallot v. Québec (Ville) [2011 QCCA 1165, at paras. 45‑47], this Court stated that for a by‑law to be regarded as effecting disguised expropriation, it must amount to an absolute negation of the exercise of the right of ownership, i.e. render its use impossible, or be tantamount to an actual confiscation of the immovable. In such a case, the by‑law that permits no uses by the owner on its land is not a zoning by‑law but an expropriation. The question of the municipality’s good or bad faith, or of its “fault”, then becomes entirely secondary, if not irrelevant. [Emphasis added; footnote omitted.]

See also Wallot v. Québec (Ville), 2011 QCCA 1165, 24 Admin. L.R. (5th) 306, at paras. 41‑54; Municipalité de Saint-Colomban v. Boutique de golf Gilles Gareau inc., 2019 QCCA 1402, at paras. 64-65; Meadowbrook Groupe Pacific inc. v. Ville de Montréal, 2019 QCCA 2037, 2019 CarswellQue 12262 (WL), at para. 29; Ressources Strateco inc. v. Procureure générale du Québec, 2020 QCCA 18, 32 C.E.L.R. (4th) 231, at paras. 113‑14; Ville de Québec v. Rivard, 2020 QCCA 146, at paras. 64‑65; Ville de Saint-Rémi v. 9120-4883 Québec inc., 2021 QCCA 630, at paras. 25‑26 (CanLII); Dupras, at paras. 27‑29.

[128]                     Accordingly, the Quebec law of disguised expropriation does not support the relevance of motive or intention under the common law of de facto taking.

[129]                     We therefore agree with the conclusion of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, at para. 75, that the law of de facto taking is “clear and settled”: a public authority’s motive or intention is not a material fact for such a claim and “cannot compensate for the failure to establish the two required elements of de facto expropriation”.

[130]                     We will now apply CPR to the partial summary judgment motion at issue in this case.

IV.         Application

A.           Introduction

[131]                     In our view, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal did not err in granting partial summary judgment. There is no genuine issue of material fact requiring a trial on either branch of the de facto taking test, both of which Annapolis must meet to succeed. We disagree with our colleagues’ conclusion, at para. 63, that there are “vast issues of material fact to be determined”, and also with their view, at para. 61, that the Court of Appeal “merely disagreed with the motion judge’s exercise of discretion”. Under the law enunciated in CPR, Annapolis’ de facto taking claim has no real chance of success and should be dismissed.

B.            The Summary Judgment Test in Nova Scotia

[132]                     Summary judgment is available when there is no genuine issue for trial (Hryniak v. Mauldin, 2014 SCC 7, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 87, at para. 34). The test for summary judgment on evidence in an action under r. 13.04 of the Nova Scotia Civil Procedure Rules was addressed by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in Shannex Inc. v. Dora Construction Ltd., 2016 NSCA 89, 58 C.L.R. (4th) 1, at para. 34. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal held that r. 13.04 asks five sequential questions, only the first three of which are relevant here:

•                        First, does the pleading disclose a genuine issue of material fact — that is, one that would affect the result (either a pure question of fact or a question of mixed fact and law)? If the answer is “yes”, the issue should not be determined on summary judgment. If the answer is “no”, the court proceeds to the second question.

•                        Second, does the pleading require the determination of a question of law (either a pure question of law or a question of mixed fact and law)? If the answers to the first and second questions are both “no”, summary judgment must issue. If the answers to the first and second questions are “no” and “yes”, respectively, leaving only an issue of law, then the court proceeds to the third question.

•                        Third, the court may grant or deny summary judgment in the exercise of its discretion. The court must ask whether the pleading has a real chance of success. If the answer is “no”, summary judgment must issue. If the answer is “yes”, the court considers whether to exercise its discretion to finally determine the issue of law.

[133]                     When the motion judge applies an incorrect legal principle or errs with regard to a purely legal question, the decision should be reviewed on a correctness standard (Hryniak, at para. 84).

[134]                     In our view, Halifax’s motion for partial summary judgment succeeds under r. 13.04 based on the third question in Shannex. We accept that there should be flexibility in allowing novel claims to either be determined on summary judgment or proceed to trial (see R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2011 SCC 42, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 45, at para. 21; Warman v. Law Society of Alberta, 2015 ABCA 368, 609 A.R. 83, at para. 6; Condominium Corp. No. 0321365 v. Cuthbert, 2016 ABCA 46, 612 A.R. 284, at para. 35; Rudichuk v. Genesis Land Development Corp., 2020 ABCA 42, 98 Alta. L.R. (6th) 339, at para. 35; Wallbridge v. Brunning, 2018 ONCA 363, 422 D.L.R. (4th) 305, at para. 26). In this case, however, Annapolis’ de facto taking claim has no real chance of success.

(1)         There Is No Genuine Issue of Material Fact That Halifax Has Acquired a Beneficial Interest in the Annapolis Lands or Flowing From Them, Either in Refusing to Up-Zone the Lands or by Allegedly Encouraging Trespass

[135]                     Neither Halifax’s 2016 municipal resolution refusing to up-zone the Annapolis Lands nor Halifax’s alleged acts of encouraging the public to trespass raises any genuine issue of material fact that Halifax has acquired a beneficial interest in the lands or flowing from them.

[136]                     The municipal resolution merely preserved the status quo by refusing to allow lands which have always been vacant and treed and situated next to a protected wilderness area to be developed into serviced residential communities. It is of no moment that the 2006 Regional Municipal Planning Strategy, as a statement of policy, stated that a possible future use of the Annapolis Lands included serviced residential development. Both the Municipal Government Act and the Halifax Charter confirm that “[t]he adoption of a municipal planning strategy does not commit the council to undertake any of the projects suggested in it” (Municipal Government Act, s. 217(2); Halifax Charter, s. 232(2)).

[137]                     Halifax’s adoption of a municipal resolution refusing to up-zone the lands also cannot be a basis for a de facto taking claim because the resolution did not result in Halifax acquiring any proprietary interest in the lands. As this Court held in CPR, at para. 33, a mere assurance that land will be used or developed in accordance with a municipality’s vision, without precluding historical or current uses of the land, is “not the sort of benefit” that can meet the acquisition requirement. This is why the common law has consistently held that a refusal to up-zone is not actionable as a de facto taking. Our colleagues claim, at para. 64, that “[p]reserving a park in its natural state may constitute an advantage accruing to the state”, but this flouts CPR’s insistence that the public authority must have acquired a proprietary interest. A mere “advantage” does not suffice. Respectfully, our colleagues’ expansive approach to what constitutes a de facto taking departs from precedent and would result in CPR being decided differently.

[138]                     We also respectfully disagree with our colleagues’ suggestion, at para. 65, that Halifax’s alleged encouragement of trespass changes this conclusion. For example, at the hearing of the appeal, Annapolis insisted that Halifax has distributed promotional material encouraging people to hike at Fox Lake, which is within the Annapolis Lands. Annapolis claimed that this was an example of Halifax’s “use [of] the Annapolis Lands as a Regional Park” (outline of argument, at para. 5, in condensed book, at p. 2). We disagree. A public authority does not and cannot acquire a proprietary interest by encouraging others to trespass. If these allegations were made out at trial, Halifax might well expose itself to liability on some other basis. But this allegation cannot ground a claim for a de facto taking.

[139]                     Annapolis’ position illustrates how incompatible the notion of an “advantage” proposed by our colleagues is with any proprietary interest. The only cases they rely on, at paras. 65-66, are the Quebec disguised expropriation cases of Benjamin and Dupras, but such reliance is misplaced. As Dupras, at para. 34, makes plain, and as our colleagues recognize, at para. 48, the acquisition requirement has no direct corollary under Quebec civil law (see M. A. LeChasseur, “L’expropriation de facto au Canada et la transcendance des solidarités”, in Service de la qualité de la profession du Barreau du Québec, vol. 509, Développements récents en droit municipal (2022), 71, at p. 172). Benjamin is also a markedly different case. In Benjamin, the City had passed zoning by-laws allowing only public uses of the owner’s land. It also took physical possession of the owner’s land by erecting a fence to transform the land into a park. There was both physical dispossession and the prior use of legislative power to render any use of the land practically impossible (Benjamin, at paras. 9, 11, 14 and 65; see also Rivard, at para. 66). This conduct is a far cry from the refusal to up-zone encountered in this appeal. The focus of Benjamin was on the change of regulation that took away the rights of the landowner, which is not the case here. Therefore, the findings of disguised expropriation in Benjamin and Dupras do not directly illuminate what can or cannot meet the acquisition requirement at common law.

[140]                     None of the allegedly “vast issues of material fact” listed by our colleagues, at para. 59, and the motion judge, at paras. 25-26 and 36, has any bearing on the de facto taking claim. To the extent that these facts help make Halifax liable for abuse of public office or unjust enrichment, an appropriate remedy can be awarded for those claims at trial. It bears noting that, as the Court of Appeal observed, at para. 83, if Halifax has acted for an improper purpose, Annapolis may succeed in its cause of action for abuse of public office. The Court of Appeal rightly relied on Mariner, at pp. 717‑18, where Cromwell J.A. explained that administrative law claims for unlawful actions are distinct from compensatory claims for de facto taking. But these facts are not material facts in support of the de facto taking claim:

•                        Correspondence between counsel in which Halifax denies allegations in the amended statement of claim are not “material facts” in support of a de facto taking claim.

•                        Signage on Annapolis’ property depicting Halifax’s logo on various trails does not have the effect of Halifax acquiring any proprietary interest.

•                        A newspaper article quoting a Halifax employee does not support the claim that Halifax has acquired a proprietary interest in the Annapolis Lands. What a newspaper says, or quotes a Halifax employee as saying, does not affect this issue.

•                        Discovery evidence on whether the Annapolis Lands were to be treated as development lands, not parklands, under the 2006 Regional Municipal Planning Strategy is not a material fact in dispute. The Strategy speaks for itself. As a matter of law, it “does not commit the council to undertake any of the projects suggested in it” (Municipal Government Act, s. 217(2); Halifax Charter, s. 232(2)). The same applies to the next two bullets that our colleagues cite, relating to the Planning Strategy, clauses 1.7.1 and 3.1.

•                        Discovery evidence relating to the 2016 municipal council resolution, and later clarifications from counsel, has no bearing on whether Halifax acquired a proprietary interest in the Annapolis Lands. The pleaded allegation of de facto taking relies on the resolution itself, which, as already noted, merely preserved the status quo.

•                        Evidence of an alleged ulterior motive of Halifax is irrelevant to the de facto taking claim, as already explained above.

[141]                     There are thus no disputed material facts as to whether Halifax acquired a proprietary interest in the Annapolis Lands. No such interest was acquired. Halifax merely refused to up-zone the lands. Because these are not material facts, we respectfully disagree with the motion judge, at para. 44, that the de facto taking claim may properly go to trial along with the balance of the matters in dispute.

(2)         There Is No Genuine Issue of Material Fact That Halifax Has Deprived Annapolis of All Reasonable Uses of the Annapolis Lands

[142]                     Even if Annapolis could establish that Halifax has acquired a beneficial interest in the Annapolis Lands or flowing from them, it cannot meet the second requirement of the test for a de facto taking: there is no genuine issue of material fact that Halifax has deprived Annapolis of all reasonable uses of its lands. This in itself is fatal to Annapolis’ appeal given that the two requirements in CPR are cumulative.

[143]                     This second element of the CPR test must be assessed “not only in relation to the land’s potential highest and best use, but having regard to the nature of the land and the range of reasonable uses to which it has actually been put” (CPR, at para. 34, quoting Mariner, at p. 717). When “a regulatory regime is imposed on land, its actual application in the specific case must be examined, not the potential, but as yet unexploited, range of possible regulation” (Mariner, at p. 718 (underlining added)). Confinement to uneconomic uses is insufficient (CPR, at paras. 8 and 27‑31). Loss of virtually all economic value is also insufficient (Mariner, at pp. 714 and 719‑27).

[144]                     In CPR, for example, this Court held that the City of Vancouver’s by-law did not remove all reasonable uses of the property because it did not prevent the landowner from using its land to operate a railway, the only use to which the land had ever been put during the history of the City (para. 34).

[145]                     The situation here is indistinguishable. As the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal noted, at para. 14, “[t]he zoning of the Annapolis Lands has not changed since the adoption of the Land Use By-law in 2006.” The court added: “Annapolis has the same rights with respect to its lands that it had prior to Council’s resolution on September 6, 2016. Nothing has changed” (para. 91). The lands were vacant and treed when Annapolis acquired them, and they remain vacant and treed. Halifax’s refusal to up-zone the lands in 2016 did not deprive Annapolis of any reasonable uses of its lands. It simply disappointed Annapolis’ hope of developing them. Annapolis speculated that, one day, it would have that right. The company made a bet and lost. There is no principled basis for saying that Halifax and its taxpayers now have to guarantee that speculative bet. We therefore agree with the submission of Halifax’s counsel, that “[Annapolis] bought barren land with no rights to do anything more than that. The municipality is not the guarantor of their land speculation” (transcript, at p. 79).

[146]                     Contrary to our colleagues’ suggestion at para. 72, Halifax has not taken Annapolis’ “right” to develop the lands. Annapolis claims that it had an unfettered right to develop the lands before they were first zoned in 1982. Yet Annapolis grounds its de facto taking claim in the proceedings before us in Halifax’s refusal to up-zone in 2016 — which, as already noted, did not affect the zoning of the lands or Annapolis’ rights. Indeed, our colleagues acknowledge that the zoning has not changed since 2006 (para. 7). The potential permissible uses of the lands before 1982 are thus irrelevant to Annapolis’ claim.

[147]                     We therefore agree with the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, at para. 92: “. . . the lands and the reasonable uses to which Annapolis can put them remain exactly as they have been for many years”. This responds to our colleagues’ criticism that the Court of Appeal “failed to identify a single reasonable possible use of the property” (para. 70; see also para. 74). The lands remain vacant and treed and are zoned exactly as before. Further, as counsel for Halifax conceded during oral argument, subject to the current zoning Annapolis can lease the lands (transcript, at p. 72), just as CPR could in CPR (CPR, at para. 34). We note, too, that confinement of the land to uneconomic uses does not in itself establish a de facto taking (see CPR, at paras. 8 and 34; Horsman and Morley, at § 5:13).

[148]                     In our respectful view, there is no basis in the record for our colleagues to assert that “it is disputed whether Halifax, by allegedly treating the Annapolis Lands as a public park, has eliminated all uses of the Lands except serviced development, which is conditional upon the approval of Annapolis’ secondary planning applications” (para. 69 (emphasis added)). Halifax did not eliminate or remove any reasonable use of the property. It simply refused to up-zone the lands to allow for residential development.

[149]                     Our colleagues nevertheless claim, at para. 76, that “it is telling that [Kasirer and Jamal JJ.] do not identify any reasonable use of the Annapolis Lands” (emphasis in original). Respectfully, this illustrates how our colleagues have changed the law. First, our colleagues evaluate the reasonable uses of the lands from the perspective of a commercial property developer, even though our law has never required that the “use” be confined to those of one class of landowner. Second, the removal requirement insists not merely that there be no reasonable uses, but also that they have been removed by the public authority. The issue is whether there has been a de facto taking by the public authority. Annapolis cannot show that Halifax removed any reasonable uses. Nor, in any event, is there any legal impediment to Annapolis leasing the lands.

[150]                     Our colleagues respond to the zoning and uses of the Annapolis Lands having not changed with the suggestion that this ignores “Halifax’s application of the regulatory scheme as alleged by Annapolis” (para. 71 (emphasis in original)). Our colleagues assert that “[i]f Annapolis can prove at trial that Halifax is unlikely to ever grant secondary planning approval, this is clearly material to its constructive taking claim” (para. 72 (emphasis in original)). We respectfully disagree. As a matter of proof, we do not see how Annapolis can prove a negative, particularly one involving a future fact.

[151]                     More importantly, even if Annapolis could somehow show that Halifax will never up-zone the lands, that could not establish that Annapolis has lost all reasonable uses of those lands. The lands have never been used for serviced development — they have always been vacant and treed. Our colleagues’ assertion amounts to saying that a refusal to up-zone vacant land can give rise to a de facto taking merely if all “potential reasonable uses” are prohibited (para. 45 (emphasis in original)). That would upset the settled law reflected in Manitoba Fisheries, Tener, Mariner, and CPR, and it would eliminate Halifax’s statutory and common law protection from liability for refusing to up-zone. In CPR, this Court specifically noted that removal of all reasonable uses of the land must be assessed in relation to both its potential uses as well as the “nature of the land and the range of reasonable uses to which it has actually been put” (para. 34, quoting Mariner, at p. 717). That statement applies equally in this case.

C.            Conclusion

[152]                     We conclude that there is no genuine issue of material fact that Halifax has acquired a beneficial interest in the Annapolis Lands or flowing from them or that Halifax has deprived Annapolis of all reasonable uses of its lands. In view of the settled law, the pleading of a de facto taking has no real chance of success. Like the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, we would grant partial summary judgment dismissing the claim for de facto taking.

V.           Disposition

[153]                     We would dismiss the appeal with costs throughout.

                    Moldaver J. —

I.               Introduction

[1]                             Where the Crown and the defence propose a specific agreed-upon sentence to a judge in exchange for an accused’s guilty plea, a stringent test, known as the “public interest” test, exists to protect that submission. The test, adopted by this Court in R. v. Anthony-Cook, 2016 SCC 43, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 204, instructs judges not to depart from a joint submission unless the proposed sentence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute, or is otherwise contrary to the public interest. Sentencing judges must not reject a joint submission lightly. They should only do so where the proposed sentence would be viewed by reasonable and informed persons as a breakdown in the proper functioning of the justice system.

[2]                             The stringency of this test is designed to protect the unique benefits that flow from joint submissions. It provides the parties with a high degree of certainty that the sentence jointly proposed will be the sentence imposed, and it avoids the need for lengthy, costly, and contentious trials. As a rule, joint submission sentencing hearings are expeditious and straightforward. They save precious time, resources, and expenses which can be channeled into other court matters. In short, they enable the justice system to function efficiently and effectively.

[3]                             The appellant, Mr. Nahanee, asks the Court to extend the Anthony-Cook public interest test from joint submissions — where the Crown and the defence agree on every aspect of the sentence — to contested sentencing hearings, where they do not. In his particular case, he proposes that the public interest test apply where the Crown and the defence have put forward different sentencing ranges to the judge following a guilty plea, on the understanding that the Crown would not ask for a sentence that exceeds the high end of its sentencing range and the defence would not ask for a sentence that falls below the low end of its sentencing range. He submits that this extension of Anthony-Cook is an incremental change in the law. With respect, I disagree.

[4]                             In my opinion, the public interest test adopted by this Court in Anthony-Cook does not, and should not, apply to contested sentencing hearings following a guilty plea, regardless of the amount of prior negotiation between the parties culminating in the plea. In such cases, however, if the sentencing judge is of a mind to impose a harsher sentence, in any respect, than what the Crown has proposed, they should notify the parties and give them an opportunity to make further submissions — failing which, they run the risk of having the harsher sentence overturned on appeal for any one of the following three errors in principle:

(i)            the appellant establishes that there was information they or the Crown could have provided to the sentencing judge that would have impacted the sentence;

(ii)         the sentencing judge failed to provide adequate reasons for imposing the harsher sentence, thereby foreclosing meaningful appellate review; or

(iii)      the sentencing judge provided erroneous or flawed reasons for imposing the harsher sentence.

[5]                             In the instant case, the sentencing judge imposed a global sentence of eight years on Mr. Nahanee for repeated sexual assaults of his two teenage nieces. This sentence exceeded the upper end of the sentencing range proposed by the Crown by two years. The sentencing judge did not provide notice that she planned to exceed the upper end of the Crown range, nor did she provide an opportunity for further submissions. Nonetheless, in my view, Mr. Nahanee has not shown that there was information he could have provided that would have impacted on the sentence; nor do the reasons of the sentencing judge disclose error. I would accordingly dismiss the appeal.

II.            Background

[6]                             Mr. Nahanee and the Crown agreed on the facts at the sentencing. The agreed statement of facts included information about the sexual assaults that formed the basis of Mr. Nahanee’s guilty pleas, as well as admissions about other sexual assaults on the victims that did not form part of his guilty pleas.

A.           Offences Against E.N.

[7]                             At age 19, Mr. Nahanee began sexually assaulting his 13-year-old niece, E.N., shortly after she moved in with him and his parents, at a time when her mother was struggling with addiction. In her first year at her grandparents’, E.N. awoke repeatedly to Mr. Nahanee digitally penetrating her vagina. Later that year, Mr. Nahanee forced her to engage in unprotected sexual intercourse. As she got older, she was able to resist the assaults by kicking him away. Regardless, he continued returning to her bedroom night after night.

[8]                             E.N. lost track of the number of assaults because they happened so frequently. The final assault, to which Mr. Nahanee admitted, fell outside the five-year timeframe captured by his guilty plea. Now 21 years old, E.N. returned to visit her grandparents. While she was sleeping next to her boyfriend, Mr. Nahanee put his hands under her shorts and tried to remove her underwear. She kicked him away.

[9]                             Mr. Nahanee’s actions took an immeasurable toll on E.N.’s life. E.N. struggled with self-esteem. Her schooling, friendships, and family relationships suffered. She felt unable to disclose the abuse to her family for fear that it would tear them apart. Moreover, she felt that she had nowhere else to go. In her later high school years, she found herself physically and emotionally exhausted from losing sleep every night while fending off Mr. Nahanee’s attacks. Years of abuse left her feeling disgusted with herself and not worthy of healthy relationships.

[10]                        E.N. reported the assaults to the police after she learned that her younger cousin, S.R., reported to the police that Mr. Nahanee had sexually assaulted her. Shortly thereafter, when E.N. disclosed to her grandmother how Mr. Nahanee had abused her for many years, she was met with disbelief.

B.            Offences Against S.R.

[11]                        Five days after the final assault on 21-year-old E.N., Mr. Nahanee, now age 27, sexually assaulted S.R., his 15-year-old niece. S.R. was staying overnight with her grandparents because her mother thought it would be safer for her to sleep there, rather than returning home by bus late at night. While S.R. was asleep in the same room as three of her younger cousins, she awoke to find Mr. Nahanee pushing his fingers inside her vagina. He then proceeded to have unprotected sexual intercourse with her.

[12]                        S.R. reported the sexual assault to the police about an hour later. The DNA sample obtained during S.R.’s examination at the hospital revealed that the semen found in her vagina came from Mr. Nahanee. The chances that the DNA was not his were found to be 1 in 81 quintillion.

[13]                        The assault had immediate and long-term physical and emotional effects on S.R. She suffered from anxiety, night terrors, and flashbacks. Shortly after the assault, she had suicidal thoughts. She was also fearful for the safety of other children in her grandmother’s home.

[14]                        In addition to the one incident described by S.R., which formed the basis of his guilty plea, Mr. Nahanee acknowledged that S.R. told her grandmother that there had been prior uncharged sexual assaults against S.R. As with E.N., her grandmother had disbelieved S.R. She accused S.R. of being vindictive and having mental health problems. S.R. was ostracized from much of the family for reporting to the police the assault that formed the basis of Mr. Nahanee’s plea.

III.         Procedural History

A.           Reasons for Sentence, British Columbia Provincial Court, 2020 BCPC 41 (Smith Prov. Ct. J.)

[15]                        At the sentencing hearing, the Crown sought a global sentence of four to six years, while Mr. Nahanee sought a global sentence of three to three and a half years.

[16]                        Smith Prov. Ct. J. sentenced Mr. Nahanee to six years’ imprisonment for the assaults on E.N., to be served consecutively to four years’ imprisonment for the assault on S.R. Taking into account the principle of totality, she reduced the sentences to five and three years respectively, to be served consecutively, for a global sentence of eight years.

[17]                        In arriving at this sentence, Smith Prov. Ct. J. gave primary consideration to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence, given that Mr. Nahanee’s offences involved the abuse of victims under the age of 18. In her view, four aggravating factors codified in the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, applied to all of the offences: abuse of a family member (s. 718.2(a)(ii)); abuse of a person under the age of 18 (s. 718.2(a)(ii.1)); abuse of a position of trust (s. 718.2(a)(iii)); and the offences had a significant impact on the victims (s. 718.2(a)(iii.1)).

[18]                        Other aggravating factors common to both cases included that: the assaults involved unprotected intercourse, exposing the victims to a risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections; both complainants were highly vulnerable while asleep; and the assaults occurred in a place where the victims had sought safety — their grandmother’s house. In E.N.’s case, there were eight instances of sexual intercourse. In S.R.’s case, other aggravating features included that: there was a 12-year age difference between S.R. and Mr. Nahanee; the assault was “not an isolated incident” (sentencing reasons, at para. 91); it was brazenly committed while other children slept nearby; and Mr. Nahanee had initially attempted to shift blame onto S.R.

[19]                        Mitigating factors in both cases included that: Mr. Nahanee entered a guilty plea; he was relatively young; and he had no criminal record. He also had a good work history, a supportive family in the community, and abided by his bail conditions. Although Mr. Nahanee demonstrated limited insight into the gravity of his crimes, Smith Prov. Ct. J. found that his expression of remorse was genuine and that he voiced a need and willingness to undergo treatment in the future.

[20]                        Smith Prov. Ct. J. considered Mr. Nahanee’s Indigenous background at length. She reviewed the Gladue report, the evidence of Mr. Nahanee’s mother, and Mr. Nahanee’s background, and found that none of the personal mitigating factors often present in cases of Indigenous offenders existed here. Hence, there was no basis to reduce his blameworthiness on account of his Indigeneity. Although Smith Prov. Ct. J. took into account his family’s historic experiences, including his grandparents’ and father’s attendance at residential schools, this was partly offset by the fact that both victims were Indigenous females who were more vulnerable to sexual assault than non-Indigenous women.

B.            British Columbia Court of Appeal, 2021 BCCA 13, 69 C.R. (7th) 246 (Willcock, Fenlon and Griffin JJ.A.)

[21]                        The Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed Mr. Nahanee’s sentence appeal. The court did not accept Mr. Nahanee’s submissions that the sentencing judge erred by: (1) failing to alert counsel that she planned to impose a sentence in excess of that sought by Crown counsel; (2) imposing a demonstrably unfit sentence; (3) incorrectly applying statutory and common law aggravating factors; and (4) failing to properly consider his Indigenous heritage. Only the first ground of appeal is at issue in this Court.

[22]                        With respect to this ground, the Court of Appeal found that it was bound by its own precedent in R. v. R.R.B., 2013 BCCA 224, 338 B.C.A.C. 106, which held that, while it is preferable for a judge to notify parties that they plan to impose a sentence greater than that sought by the Crown and invite further submissions, failure to do so does not amount to reversible error. Nor did the court agree with Mr. Nahanee that R.R.B. had been overtaken by Anthony-Cook, such that the public interest test should apply to the negotiated sentencing ranges in his case. In the court’s view, R.R.B. was distinguishable because, like Mr. Nahanee’s case, it dealt with a contested sentencing rather than a joint submission, which was the sole focus of Anthony-Cook.

[23]                        In the court’s view, had the trial judge been obliged to notify counsel and invite further submissions, the failure to do so would only amount to a reversible error if Mr. Nahanee could show he was prejudiced. In this regard, the evidence Mr. Nahanee said he would have introduced at trial — that his second guilty plea, to the offence against E.N., was only entered after he was assured of the Crown’s sentencing position — was before the judge. The judge was told by defence counsel that Mr. Nahanee entered his second guilty plea following “extensive resolution discussions” that included “a thorough statement of facts and [the] Crown’s sentencing [position]” (C.A. reasons, at para. 56). There was no prejudice to Mr. Nahanee warranting interference with his sentence.

IV.         Issues

[24]                        This appeal raises three issues:

A.                     Does the Anthony-Cook framework for departure from joint submissions following a guilty plea apply to contested sentencing hearings following a guilty plea?

B.                     Are sentencing judges required to give notice to the parties and provide an opportunity for further submissions if they plan to impose a harsher sentence than the Crown proposes?

C.                     Does Mr. Nahanee’s sentence warrant intervention?

V.           Analysis

A.           Anthony-Cook Does Not Apply to Contested Sentencing Hearings Following a Guilty Plea

[25]                        Anthony-Cook set out a stringent public interest test which must be met before sentencing judges can reject a joint submission following a guilty plea. At para. 34, the Court stated that:

Rejection [of a joint submission] denotes a submission so unhinged from the circumstances of the offence and the offender that its acceptance would lead reasonable and informed persons, aware of all the relevant circumstances, including the importance of promoting certainty in resolution discussions, to believe that the proper functioning of the justice system had broken down.

[26]                        This test sets a very high bar by design. It is meant to encourage agreement between the parties, which saves court time at sentencing. The test also incentivizes guilty pleas, sparing victims and the justice system the need for costly, time-consuming trials (Anthony-Cook, at paras. 35 and 40). Accused persons benefit because they have a very high degree of certainty that the sentence jointly proposed will be the sentence they receive; and the Crown benefits because it is assured of a guilty plea on terms it is prepared to accept (paras. 36-39). Both parties also benefit by not having to prepare for a trial or a contested sentencing hearing.

[27]                        To be clear, a joint submission covers off every aspect of the sentence proposed. To the extent that the parties may agree to most, but not all, aspects of the sentence — be it the length or type of the sentence, or conditions, terms, or ancillary orders attached to it — the submission will not constitute a joint submission. The public interest test does not apply to bits and pieces of a sentence upon which the parties are in agreement; it applies across the board, or not at all. Apart from the logistical problems of applying two different tests to parts of the same proposed sentence, at the end of the day, there is only one composite sentence. Arriving at a sentence involves an assessment of all of its component parts. Isolating one or two parts of the sentence and subjecting them to a different test is antithetical to this determination, and may well undermine it.

[28]                        Mr. Nahanee asks this Court to extend the public interest test to contested sentencing hearings following a guilty plea, which generally will have come about after some negotiation between the Crown and the accused. He submits that the benefits of resolution discussions identified in Anthony-Cook apply equally to joint and contested submissions on sentence.

[29]                        With respect, I do not accept Mr. Nahanee’s position. While recognizing that a contested sentence hearing following a guilty plea spares victims and the justice system the need for costly trials, the Anthony-Cook public interest test must remain confined to joint submissions for three reasons.

(1)         The Benefits of Joint Submissions Are Significantly Lessened With Contested Sentencings

[30]                        Contested sentencings following a guilty plea must be treated differently than joint submissions following a guilty plea because they do not offer, to the same degree, the benefits that Anthony-Cook sought to protect: certainty and efficiency. The public interest test encourages agreement on a specific agreed-upon sentence and offers certainty for the parties by protecting this agreement in order to promote efficient outcomes for the justice system and all participants. There is no such certainty or agreement where the Crown and the defence propose different sentencing ranges.

[31]                        Contested sentencings are characterized by a lack of agreement on a specific sentence, and therefore cannot offer the same degree of certainty as joint submissions. Joint submissions, which cover off every aspect of the sentence proposed to the court, offer certainty because of agreement in the form of a quid pro quo: the accused agrees to plead guilty in exchange for the Crown agreeing to recommend a specific sentence to the court that both the Crown and the accused find acceptable (Anthony-Cook, at para. 36). Nothing remains to be litigated. By its very nature, the quid pro quo of which I speak does not exist with contested sentencings, regardless of the amount of prior negotiation between the parties culminating in the guilty plea (I.F., Attorney General of Ontario, at para. 7). The proposed sentence is neither fixed nor final. Loose ends remain to be litigated. Even in situations where the Crown and the accused may have resolution discussions prior to a contested sentencing hearing, the fact remains that the Crown is not agreeing to recommend a specific sentence to the court upon which the parties agree.

[32]                        Unlike a joint submission where both parties can be reasonably certain that their agreed upon position will be the outcome, the most an accused can reasonably expect at a contested sentencing is that the sentence is likely to fall within the disparate ranges proposed by counsel, and that it will not likely exceed the Crown’s upper range. Contested sentencings lack the agreement of a quid pro quo — and resulting certainty — that this Court sought to protect in Anthony-Cook.

[33]                        In addition to providing a heightened degree of certainty for the parties, joint submissions are also significantly more efficient for the justice system than contested sentencing hearings. Although both save the justice system and its participants the time, stress, and cost of a trial, a contested sentencing requires the parties to prepare for and provide comprehensive submissions at a sentencing hearing. A joint submission hearing, on the other hand, can be counted on to take a fraction of the time and resources.

[34]                        This case provides an excellent example of the time and resources a contested sentencing hearing can eat up. Mr. Nahanee’s sentencing hearing took an entire day. The Crown and the defence properly put their best foot forward, providing lengthy submissions in support of the reasonableness of their positions. Following the hearing, the judge needed two weeks to deliberate and render a written decision. In contrast, joint submission hearings generally consist of the Crown reading in an agreed statement of facts and setting out the joint position. This will usually be completed in short order, with the sentence being imposed on the spot. Rarely is the judge required to render a lengthy decision. 

[35]                        To be clear, these reasons should not be taken as placing pressure on accused persons to agree to a joint submission which they feel is not in their best interests. Proceeding to a contested sentencing may be the advisable choice for any number of reasons. Regardless, by virtue of their nature, joint submissions and contested sentencing hearings are not alike and should not be treated as though they are.

[36]                        Anthony-Cook protected joint submissions following a guilty plea because of their unique benefits to the justice system and all of its participants. These benefits — namely certainty and efficiency — are significantly attenuated in contested sentencing hearings. As a result, contested sentencings do not demand the stringent protection that the public interest test provides for joint submissions.

(2)         Joint Submissions Would Be Discouraged

[37]                        If the Anthony-Cook public interest test applied to both joint submissions and contested sentencing hearings following a guilty plea, joint submissions would lose much of their attraction. They would no longer offer an unparalleled certainty as to the length of the accused’s sentence, since contested sentencings would offer a similar certainty. Where a joint submission is put forward, it will be the rarest of cases that a judge applying the public interest test deviates from the specific sentence proposed. In a contested sentencing, a judge applying the public interest test would be equally constrained from imposing a sentence that exceeded the upper end of the sentencing range proposed by the Crown.

[38]                        In addition to offering a high degree of certainty like joint submissions, a contested sentencing hearing would offer an added benefit to the accused that a joint submission would not: the possibility of a lower sentence. Accused persons might well choose to gamble by proceeding to a contested sentencing, leaving open the possibility of obtaining a lower sentence than the one that would have formed the basis of a joint submission. If joint submissions were frequently replaced with contested sentencing hearings, this would result in more lengthy and time-consuming sentencing hearings, thereby placing an even greater strain on a justice system that is already overburdened.

[39]                        Discouraging joint submissions by making contested sentencings a more attractive option undermines the overriding purpose of Anthony-Cook: to encourage joint submissions. As this Court stressed in Anthony-Cook, joint submissions not only “permit our justice system to function more efficiently . . . they permit it to function” (para. 40). Without them, “our justice system would be brought to its knees, and eventually collapse under its own weight” (para. 40).

(3)         The Sentencing Judge’s Role Would Be Partially Usurped and Offloaded Onto the Crown

[40]                        Sentencing judges are entrusted with crafting fit sentences that are proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the offender’s degree of responsibility (Criminal Code, s. 718.1). Applying the public interest test to contested sentencings would limit judges’ discretion by effectively capping the lengths of sentences at the Crown’s proposed upper range. A judge wishing to exceed the Crown’s upper range would have to consider whether the upper range was so low that reasonable persons would view it as a breakdown in the functioning of the justice system. This stringent test would rarely be met.

[41]                        As a result, one aspect of the responsibility to craft a fit sentence would gradually shift from sentencing judges to the Crown. The upper ranges for guilty pleas would effectively become a Crown prerogative. Although judicial discretion is limited by the public interest test in the context of a joint submission, this limitation is justified in order to protect the parties’ agreement on a specific sentence — the length of which is not unilaterally decided by the Crown. In contrast, if the public interest test applied to contested sentencings, the upper range would often be unilaterally decided by the Crown. This, in turn, would also have consequences for parties considering case law ranges when agreeing on a joint submission. Joint submissions are rarely published. Parties deciding on a joint submission will generally look to case law ranges established in contested sentencing hearings following a guilty plea. Allowing the Crown to be the arbiter of the upper range of sentences following a guilty plea is surely not a role that Parliament intended to confer upon the Crown (R. v. Blake-Samuels, 2021 ONCA 77, 69 C.R. (7th) 274, at para. 29; R. v. Jacobson, 2019 NWTSC 9, [2019] 5 W.W.R. 172, at para. 35).

[42]                        To summarize, the stringent public interest test in Anthony-Cook applies only to joint submissions following guilty pleas, and not to contested sentencings following guilty pleas, for three main reasons: (1) the benefits of a joint submission — certainty and efficiency — which justify the stringent public interest test are significantly attenuated on a contested sentencing hearing; (2) joint submissions would be discouraged because accused persons would have less incentive to compromise and more incentive to seek a lower sentence at a contested sentencing; and (3) applying the public interest test to contested sentencings undercuts the sentencing judge’s responsibility to determine the upper range of fit sentences, leading over time to the impermissible offloading of this responsibility onto the Crown.

B.            Sentencing Judges Are Required to Notify Parties and Provide an Opportunity for Further Submissions if They Plan to Impose a Harsher Sentence Than What the Crown Has Proposed

[43]                        Mr. Nahanee and the Crown agree, as do I, that sentencing judges should notify the parties and provide an opportunity for further submissions if they plan to impose a harsher sentence than what the Crown has proposed. The parties diverge on when a failure to provide notice and/or the opportunity for further submissions is an error justifying appellate intervention. Before moving to a discussion of when an error justifies appellate intervention, it might be helpful to provide some guidance on the requirements for notice and the opportunity for further submissions.

(1)         Notice Requirement

[44]                        Sentencing judges should let the parties know as soon as possible if they are concerned that the Crown’s proposed sentence is, or may be, too lenient and they are contemplating exceeding it.

[45]                        Adequate notice does not require the judge to set out in detail, or with exactitude, what it is that they find troublesome with the Crown’s proposed sentence; they should, however, do so whenever possible. It is enough for a judge to advise the parties that, in their view, the sentence proposed by the Crown appears too lenient, having regard to the seriousness of the offence and/or the degree of responsibility of the accused. Providing comprehensive reasons for this concern may, and often will, prove impossible since the judge’s position at this point is unlikely to be fixed. As indicated, the purpose is simply to put the parties on notice that the judge is considering exceeding the Crown’s proposed sentence. Notifying the parties can be as simple as saying: I am considering imposing a higher sentence than the Crown is seeking due to the seriousness of this offence (see, e.g., R. v. Scott, 2016 NLCA 16, 376 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 167, at para. 37). While notice need not take a particular form, it must be more than simply asking questions or expressing vague concerns about the parties’ sentencing proposals.

[46]                        There may be cases where the judge has no thought of imposing a harsher sentence than the Crown has proposed until the sentencing hearing is over and the judge has reserved their decision. When that occurs, the judge should notify the parties as soon as possible and invite further submissions, either orally or in writing. At this juncture, the judge may be able to provide greater detail as to the reasons for their concern.

[47]                        According to Mr. Nahanee, an accused should be allowed to withdraw their guilty plea when the judge provides notice that they are considering exceeding the Crown range. I would not give effect to this submission. Sentencing judges should only allow for the withdrawal of guilty pleas in exceptional circumstances, such as where counsel have made a fundamental error about the availability of the proposed sentence (Anthony-Cook, at para. 59). For example, this would occur where a period of incarceration is mandated by the Criminal Code, but the parties have erroneously proposed non-custodial sentences with differing terms and conditions. As the Attorney General of Ontario noted, it is settled law that an accused cannot withdraw their guilty plea solely because the judge does not agree with the proposed sentence (I.F., at para. 19; R. v. Lyons, 1987 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at p. 372). Allowing a plea to be struck simply because the judge decides to impose a harsher sentence than expected would undermine the finality of guilty pleas and encourage judge shopping (R. v. Wong, 2018 SCC 25, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 696, at para. 29).

(2)         Opportunity for Further Submissions

[48]                        It is critical that both the Crown and the accused initially provide as much relevant information as possible at the contested sentencing hearing in support of their respective positions. The opportunity for further submissions should not be relied on as a chance to pull a rabbit out of the hat. Additional submissions should respond to the concerns raised, including matters that the parties considered irrelevant or simply overlooked in their initial submissions. For example, this will be the case where the parties propose differing non-custodial options and the judge signals that they are considering a period of incarceration. Further argument and pertinent authorities will likely be necessary.

[49]                        In appropriate cases, where facets of the plea negotiation are highly relevant to support the reasonableness of the Crown’s proposed sentence — which may at first blush seem very low — the parties are well-advised to reveal the pertinent information in their initial submissions. Although documents and discussions arising out of plea negotiations are subject to settlement privilege (R. v. Shyback, 2018 ABCA 331, 366 C.C.C. (3d) 197, at para. 28), the parties can agree to waive this privilege where it would assist the judge in determining a fit sentence. The sentence proposed by the Crown will justifiably be more lenient than expected if, for example, the accused provided vital information for another prosecution or was a confidential informant. If there is a concern about revealing confidential information, the parties should discuss an appropriate way to let the judge know, such as a sealed affidavit. Another way may be for the parties to alert the judge as to the negotiation considerations without getting into details. For example, the Crown can be expected to alert the judge in its submissions that it has considered the strength of its case in proposing its sentencing range, particularly where the range would appear to be too lenient. This is commonly done without the Crown going into detail about the deficiencies of its case. In sum, revealing facets of the plea negotiation will sometimes play an important role in enabling the judge to properly assess the fitness of the competing proposed sentences.

[50]                        Where the parties are put on notice and given an opportunity to make further submissions, the format for doing so rests with the judge in consultation with the parties. The judge may seek oral or written submissions, or both. The parties must be allowed a reasonable time to prepare additional submissions, if needed.

(3)         Errors Justifying Appellate Intervention

[51]                        Mr. Nahanee submits that, in cases like his, a judge’s failure to provide notice and/or the opportunity for further submissions is a breach of procedural fairness that will always justify a hearing where the sentence is considered afresh, even if there is no additional information — much less pertinent information — that the accused could have presented to the judge.

[52]                        With respect, I disagree. Procedural fairness is not the applicable route of appeal. Rather, the applicable route of appeal is the error in principle model, as outlined in R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64 [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089. The judge’s failure to provide notice and the opportunity for further submissions is an error in principle that will only justify appellate intervention “where it appears from the trial judge’s decision that such an error had an impact on the sentence” (Lacasse, at para. 44; see also R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, at para. 26). In short, this failure is always an error, though not necessarily one warranting appellate intervention. Where the appellant can establish impact, the judge will have been deprived of an important piece of information relevant to determining a fit sentence. I see no reason to diverge from this established approach to sentence appeals.

[53]                        The doctrine of common law procedural fairness was largely developed in administrative law cases, but the principles are also applicable to criminal cases (see, e.g., Lyons, at p. 361). It is well established that the requirements for procedural fairness are context-specific (Lyons, at p. 361; Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1999 CanLII 699 (SCC), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, at paras. 21-22; Charkaoui v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 SCC 9, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 350, at para. 57; R. v. Rodgers, 2006 SCC 15, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 554, at paras. 47-48). Certain protections required in one context to ensure procedural fairness may not be required in another (Lyons, at p. 361). In other words, “[w]hat is fair in a particular case will depend on the context of the case” (Ruby v. Canada (Solicitor General), 2002 SCC 75, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 3, at para. 39).

[54]                          Mr. Nahanee alleges that the procedural unfairness in his case is a breach of the rule of audi alteram partem: a person must be given an opportunity to be heard where the outcome will affect them (A. (L.L.) v. B. (A.), 1995 CanLII 52 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 536, at para. 27). In my view, his submission must fail. There is no breach of common law procedural fairness in the context of a sentencing hearing where the accused has been made aware of the Crown’s case and been given a full opportunity to respond to it. That is a very different situation from one where the accused has been denied any meaningful right to be heard at first instance (see, e.g., Cardinal v. Director of Kent Institution, 1985 CanLII 23 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 643; Baker; R. v. McDonald, 2018 ONCA 369, 360 C.C.C. (3d) 494). Such cases involve both actual and perceived unfairness to the appellant.

[55]                          A fair hearing must generally allow the parties to know the opposing party’s case so that they can respond to it and bring evidence in support of their position (Rodgers, at para. 48; see also Ruby, at para. 40). According to this general rule, accused persons like Mr. Nahanee are not denied a fair hearing because they have been made aware of the Crown’s case and have provided detailed submissions at the initial sentencing hearing in support of their position. While the accused will not have been informed about the sentencing judge’s concerns, they will have put their best foot forward as to why the sentence they have proposed is fit and why the Crown’s sentence is excessive. This will often include, where necessary, cross-examining Crown witnesses, calling defence witnesses, filing reports, and/or providing an extensive review of relevant case law. That is a far cry from joint submissions, where the parties are unlikely to have presented their case in such a detailed and comprehensive manner. It follows that, in the context of a joint submission, fairness requires that the parties receive notice and information about the judge’s concerns in order to know how to respond in a more detailed manner (Anthony-Cook, at para. 58). The same concerns are significantly attenuated in the context of a contested sentencing hearing, where it is expected that the parties will have provided detailed and comprehensive submissions. 

[56]                          Here, Mr. Nahanee claims that he is entitled to be sentenced afresh because he was deprived of the opportunity to provide information at his sentencing hearing, assuming such information exists, regardless of whether it would have had an impact on his sentence. Respectfully, I disagree. As indicated, I am satisfied that in this context, the applicable route of appeal is the error in principle model, which requires impact.

[57]                          I say that because, in this context, there is no meaningful loss of procedural fairness since, by its nature, the informational deficiency, if it exists, is one that can be readily remedied on appeal (Baker, at para. 24). The basis of the appeal would be an alleged error in principle. The appellant need only inform the court of the information they were unable to bring to the attention of the sentencing judge. If this information is material, such that it appears to the appellate court that it would have impacted the sentence, the court can sentence afresh (Friesen, at para. 27; Lacasse, at paras. 43-44).

[58]                        Mr. Nahanee suggests that the error in principle model is inappropriate because appellate judges will be unable to assess impact, since they can never know what the parties may have put before the judge, had the parties been offered a further opportunity to do so. As a result, it is impossible for appellate judges to say that the sentence would not have been different (A.F., at para. 99; see also R. v. Sidhu, 2022 ABCA 66, 411 C.C.C. (3d) 329, at para. 73; R. v. Mohiadin, 2021 ONCA 122, at para. 9 (CanLII); Blake-Samuels, at paras. 36 and 38). I would not give effect to this submission. The parties are best placed to inform the appellate court of the information they would have provided, had they been given the opportunity to do so. It is not unduly burdensome to require the appellant — with the aid of the Crown where it has relevant information to share as to why its proposed sentence was appropriate — to provide the appellate court with the information the sentencing judge did not have due to their failure to provide notice. If there is no additional information that the accused would have provided, then the lack of opportunity to provide this information will have had no impact on the sentence. This is simply not a situation where the error’s impact on sentence is unknowable, such that impact must be assumed in all cases.

[59]                        In my view, where the sentencing judge fails to provide notice and/or an opportunity for further submissions, there are three types of errors in principle that would warrant intervention by the appellate court:

                                      i.         If the failure to provide notice and/or further submissions impacts the sentence. The appellant must demonstrate that there was information that they could have provided, if given the opportunity to do so, and it appears to the appellate court that this information would have impacted the sentence. If the appellate court is of the view that there is missing information that would realistically have impacted the sentence, the court can consider the sentence afresh. In assessing impact, the focus should be on whether the missing information is material to the sentence at issue. For example, where both parties propose non-custodial sentences and the judge imposes a period of incarceration without notice, the appellant can establish impact by pointing to something material that they would have presented had they been given notice and the opportunity for further submissions, such as a pertinent authority or important mitigating fact. The Crown should assist the appellate court wherever possible by providing or confirming the information that the sentencing judge did not have.

                                    ii.         If the sentencing judge failed to provide reasons, or provided unclear or insufficient reasons, for imposing the harsher sentence. Failure to provide sufficient reasons is an error of law, which is a type of error in principle (Friesen, at para. 26; R. v. Sheppard, 2002 SCC 26, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, at para. 28). The appellate court may only intervene if the insufficiency of reasons foreclosed meaningful appellate review. While it is preferable for sentencing judges to explicitly say why they exceeded the Crown range, it will not necessarily foreclose meaningful appellate review if this is not done. The court may look to the record, as a whole, to determine whether sufficient reasons have been given for exceeding the Crown range. Courts are to take a functional approach to sufficiency of reasons (Sheppard, at para. 50).

                                 iii.         If the sentencing judge provided erroneous reasons for imposing the harsher sentence. The appellate court may intervene if the sentencing judge relied on flawed or unsupportable reasoning for imposing the harsher sentence, such as the erroneous consideration of an aggravating factor or misapprehension of relevant authorities. Standing alone, however, flawed reasoning will not be enough; the appellant must also satisfy the court that this reasoning impacted the sentence (Lacasse, at paras. 43-44).

[60]                        An appellant may argue one or more of these three grounds of appeal. In cases where it may be difficult for the appellant to demonstrate impact based on the content of the sentencing judge’s reasons, the latter two grounds of appeal — in addition to the Crown’s obligation to assist the appellate court with respect to information not in front of the sentencing judge — act as safeguards to ensure that the appellant can obtain a remedy where appropriate.

[61]                        If there is an error in principle that impacts the sentence, the appellate court may sentence the appellant afresh without deference, save for the findings made by the sentencing judge (Friesen, at para. 28). Although I need not decide whether appellate courts can remit a case back to the trial court for a fresh sentencing hearing, I would not foreclose the possibility that they could, in rare cases, order a fresh sentencing hearing where the record is so incomplete as to foreclose a fresh assessment at the appellate court. If no error in principle is established, or the error in principle does not have an impact on the sentence, then the only potential remaining ground of appeal will be whether the sentence is demonstrably unfit (Friesen, at para. 26).

C.            Mr. Nahanee’s Sentence Does Not Warrant Intervention

[62]                        Mr. Nahanee asks this Court for a fresh sentencing hearing on the basis that he was denied procedural fairness at the sentencing hearing. I decline to do so, for reasons I have already explained. Rather, I consider the three possible errors, namely: (1) failure to provide notice and an opportunity for further submissions; (2) failure to provide sufficient reasons for imposing the harsher sentence; and (3) erroneous reasons were provided for imposing the harsher sentence. In addition, while not formally advanced as a ground of appeal before this Court, for the sake of completeness I consider whether Mr. Nahanee’s sentence was demonstrably unfit. I find that none of these alleged errors warrant intervention in this case.

(1)         Notice and Opportunity for Further Submissions

[63]                        Although the sentencing judge failed to provide notice that she was planning to exceed the Crown range and to provide an opportunity for further submissions, there was no impact on the sentence. Mr. Nahanee has not demonstrated that he had information to provide to the sentencing judge that would have impacted his sentence. He submits that, given the opportunity, he would have told the judge that he only entered his second guilty plea, regarding the offence against E.N., after being assured of the Crown’s sentencing position.

[64]                        This information was already before the sentencing judge. At the plea proceeding prior to sentencing, Mr. Nahanee’s trial counsel indicated to the judge that the matter regarding E.N. had been set down for trial but that, “[t]hrough extensive resolution discussions with my friend, including quite a thorough statement of facts and Crown’s sentencing decision which was provided by my friend’s office . . . I do have instructions to resolve [the matter] and enter a plea of guilty” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 3).

[65]                        The sentencing judge was well aware of the information Mr. Nahanee now says he would have provided had the judge given him notice. Hence, he has not demonstrated any impact on his sentence warranting intervention.

(2)         Sufficient Reasons for Exceeding the Crown Range

[66]                        The sentencing judge provided adequate reasons for why she exceeded the Crown range. Although it would have been preferable had she explicitly addressed this issue, the judge’s detailed reasons leave no question as to why the Crown’s range of four to six years was too low. In particular, the judge cited the seriousness and repeated nature of Mr. Nahanee’s crimes, the young age and Indigenous background of the victims, and the lack of factors in Mr. Nahanee’s Gladue report that would have reduced his blameworthiness. I am satisfied that, looking at the judge’s reasons functionally and as a whole, they do not foreclose meaningful appellate review (Sheppard, at para. 50).

(3)         Erroneous Reasons for Exceeding the Crown Range

[67]                        The sentencing judge’s reasons for exceeding the Crown range, when read as a whole, were not erroneous. As noted above, the factors she considered were relevant and supported her conclusion that the upper end of the Crown’s range was too low. 

(4)         Whether the Sentence Was Demonstrably Unfit

[68]                        The eight-year sentence was not demonstrably unfit. The sentencing judge pre-empted this Court’s decision in Friesen — released only two months later — that upper-single and double-digit penitentiary terms for sexual offences against children should not be unusual, nor reserved for rare circumstances (para. 114).

[69]                        Mr. Nahanee’s prolonged and profoundly harmful actions irreparably impacted the lives of two young Indigenous women. His actions highlight the heightened risk of sexual assault faced by marginalized young women. Mr. Nahanee was in a position of trust as the victims’ uncle and violated them while they were in a vulnerable position, asleep at their grandmother’s house. Eight years cannot be said to be a demonstrably unfit sentence for his crimes.

VI.         Disposition

[70]                        I would dismiss Mr. Nahanee’s appeal.

                    Karakatsanis J. —

I.               Introduction

[71]                        I would allow this appeal and remit the matter to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia for sentencing afresh. I agree with my colleague that the sentencing judge was not required to apply the public interest test from R. v. Anthony-Cook, 2016 SCC 43, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 204, which is reserved for joint submissions. I further agree that a judge considering a harsher sentence than that proposed by the Crown is required to advise the parties and invite further submissions. What divides us is the question of remedy when a judge fails to follow this procedure.

[72]                        In R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, and R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, this Court set out the principles concerning appellate intervention in appeals from the sentence imposed. For good reason, these decisions narrowly defined the role of appellate courts in varying sentencing decisions. However, they were not concerned with procedural fairness, nor did they address the longstanding principle that procedural fairness is an independent basis for reviewing decisions affecting an individual’s rights and interests, and providing a remedy if appropriate. This case requires the Court to address the additional issue of procedural fairness and the related principle that justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be done.

[73]                        In my view, it is fundamentally unfair for a sentencing judge to impose a sentence upon an accused that is harsher than the one proposed by the Crown without giving the parties notice and an opportunity to respond to the judge’s concerns. An accused is not required to demonstrate that this flawed procedure resulted in a sentence that is demonstrably unfit or that it amounted to an error in principle that had an impact on sentence. Nor is it necessary to demonstrate that there was specific information that would have been provided to the sentencing judge and that it would have impacted the sentence.

[74]                        Sentencing is a dynamic process in which the art of advocacy, the adversarial context, and the parties’ legitimate expectations play an important role; the parties are entitled to put their best foot forward to respond to the case they must meet. They must be able to address a point of fact or law that is of concern to the sentencing judge, and which could result in a more severe deprivation of liberty. Where this is not done, there is a breach of the duty of procedural fairness which, in itself, will generally warrant appellate intervention. In such a case, the appellate court should conduct a fresh assessment to determine a fit sentence.

II.            Analysis

[75]                        I proceed as follows. First, I consider the duty of procedural fairness and the high degree of procedural fairness that is required in sentencing proceedings. Second, I conclude that the duty of procedural fairness is breached where a sentencing judge fails to provide the parties with notice of their intent to impose a harsher sentence than the Crown proposes or an opportunity to make submissions to address the judge’s concerns. Third, I consider the appropriate remedy to restore fairness and the appearance of fairness to the proceedings.

A.           Procedural Fairness in Sentencing

[76]                        I begin with first principles. Procedural fairness is a rule of fundamental justice (Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Harkat, 2014 SCC 37, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 33, at para. 41; R. v. S. (R.D.), 1997 CanLII 324 (SCC), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484, at para. 77, per Cory J.). The common law doctrine of procedural fairness has been developed in both administrative law cases and criminal cases. In criminal proceedings, the obligation to hold a fair hearing is due to both the accused and the Crown (S. (R.D.), at para. 96, per Cory J.).

[77]                        An essential component of procedural fairness is that parties have the right to be heard. Individuals whose rights, privileges or interests are affected by a decision must be given an opportunity to be heard before the decision is made (A. (L.L.) v. B. (A.), 1995 CanLII 52 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 536, at para. 27; Lowry and Lepper v. The Queen, 1972 CanLII 171 (SCC), [1974] S.C.R. 195). Allowing those affected to put forward their views and evidence fully and have them considered by the decision-maker contributes to a fair, open and impartial process.

[78]                        The right to be heard is closely tied to the right to notice of the case to meet. The case to meet informs the parties of the issues they need to address and guides their submissions and the evidence they will adduce at the hearing (Harkat, at para. 41).

[79]                        In sentencing proceedings, a high degree of procedural fairness is required. It is well established that the requirements of procedural fairness are context-specific (R. v. Rodgers, 2006 SCC 15, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 554, at para. 47; R. v. Zinck, 2003 SCC 6, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 41, at para. 36). Depending on the nature of the decision being made and the importance of the rights and interests at stake, procedural fairness may need to be more jealously guarded and strictly enforced. Accordingly, especially in proceedings of a penal nature, it is essential that parties be afforded the right to be heard (Supermarchés Jean Labrecque Inc. v. Flamand, 1987 CanLII 19 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 219, at para. 60).

[80]                        Procedural fairness is also particularly important in sentencing proceedings due to their adversarial nature. In the adversarial justice system, the positions of the parties and their framing of the issues will guide the evidence led and submissions at a sentencing hearing (R. v. Mian, 2014 SCC 54, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 689, at para. 38). While a judge is permitted to impose a harsher sentence than the Crown proposes, the jeopardy faced by the accused is typically tied to the Crown’s recommendation. Accordingly, at a contested sentencing hearing, the accused will be directing argument primarily to the positions taken by the Crown; the points of disagreement between the parties on sentence generally form the basis of their submissions (see, e.g., R. v. Blake-Samuels, 2021 ONCA 77, 69 C.R. (7th) 274, at para. 36). The accused may believe a point not disputed by the Crown is not in contention and not make any submissions on that point; a subsequent sentence inconsistent with the point can then take both parties by surprise (see, e.g., R. v. Huon, 2010 BCCA 143, at paras. 5-6 (CanLII)).

[81]                        As a result, it is critical that the parties have notice of the case to meet and an opportunity to be heard where a judge intends to depart from their submissions on sentencing.

B.            Failing to Give Notice or to Invite Submissions Is a Breach of Procedural Fairness

[82]                        In Anthony-Cook, at para. 58, the Court stated that where a trial judge is troubled by a joint submission on sentence, “fundamental fairness dictates that an opportunity be afforded to counsel to make further submissions in an attempt to address the . . . judge’s concerns before the sentence is imposed” (quoting R. v. G.W.C., 2000 ABCA 333, 277 A.R. 20, at para. 26). Although this statement was made in the context of joint submissions, in my view, the underlying principle extends to contested sentencing hearings where a judge is planning to depart from the parties’ submissions and impose a harsher sentence than what the Crown has proposed (see also Blake-Samuels, at para. 32).

[83]                        The failure to advise counsel or invite further submissions regarding the judge’s intention to impose a harsher sentence than the Crown’s recommendation is a breach of procedural fairness because it denies the parties adequate notice of the case to meet and the right to be heard. The flawed procedure impacts the parties’ ability to make meaningful submissions, which might have addressed the judge’s concerns. There is a heightened risk that the judge will impose a sentence without all of the relevant information that might have been provided. Furthermore, the appearance of fairness in the proceedings is undermined.

[84]                        Respectfully, I do not agree with the assumption that where a judge fails to provide notice or an opportunity for further submissions in the context of a contested sentencing hearing, the parties will have already provided comprehensive submissions and thus fairness concerns are significantly attenuated (Moldaver J.’s reasons, at paras. 55 and 64).

[85]                        First, given the adversarial nature of sentencing proceedings, it is unrealistic to expect that the parties will initially adduce all potentially relevant information. The submissions of the Crown and the accused will be tailored to each other’s positions, and may not be responsive to the unexpressed concerns of the sentencing judge (see, e.g., Huon, at paras. 5-6). In R. v. Scott, 2016 NLCA 16, 376 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 167, at para. 37, Rowe J.A. (as he then was) recognized this point, stating:

. . . certain facts or cases may become relevant if the sentencing judge is considering “jumping” the Crown’s submission on sentence, whereas they would not be relevant if the judge were to impose a sentence no greater than that sought by the Crown. Unless Defence counsel is aware that the judge is considering “jumping” the Crown’s submission on sentence, matters relevant to sentence may not be placed before the judge.

If counsel were expected to adduce all relevant information, in an effort to pre-empt every potential concern of the sentencing judge, this would result in more lengthy and time-consuming sentencing hearings, thereby placing an even greater strain on the justice system.

[86]                        Counsel may also choose not to reveal certain information during the sentencing hearing, even though it may be relevant, absent some indication that it bears on an issue of concern to the sentencing judge. For example, there may be a negotiated element to the parties’ positions on sentencing. The reasons and rationale for the negotiations and resulting agreements may not be readily apparent to a sentencing judge, and may not be offered at first instance as they may be sensitive in nature (see, e.g., Scott, at paras. 19-22). Resolution discussions are also protected by settlement privilege, subject to exceptions “when the justice of the case requires it” (Sable Offshore Energy Inc. v. Ameron International Corp., 2013 SCC 37, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 623, at para. 12, citing Rush & Tompkins Ltd. v. Greater London Council, [1988] 3 All E.R. 737 (H.L.), at p. 740; R. v. Delchev, 2015 ONCA 381, 126 O.R. (3d) 267, at para. 28). Accordingly, as the intervener Attorney General of Ontario put it, “Routinely disclosing plea negotiations during sentencing submissions would erode the privilege attached to those negotiations. It is a practice best avoided” (I.F., at para. 16).

[87]                        If the parties knew the judge was considering a sentence harsher than the Crown proposes, the Crown could provide useful information to justify the reasons for its position (see, e.g., R. v. Burback, 2012 ABCA 30, 522 A.R. 352, at para. 14). Either party may seek to provide further information, evidence or argument to address the judge’s concerns, or provide additional authorities not previously brought to the judge’s attention (see, e.g., R. v. Ehaloak, 2017 NUCA 4, at para. 37 (CanLII)). For example, a harsher sentence could trigger a collateral consequence. If there is a negotiated element to the parties’ positions involving a quid pro quo that the parties have, for whatever reason, chosen not to explain, being advised that the judge is considering a harsher sentence provides them the opportunity to put all their cards on the table (R.F., at para. 62). For example, the Crown may take the opportunity to explain that the apparent leniency of its recommendation is warranted, based on deficiencies in its case that would have made it difficult to secure a conviction at trial. 

[88]                        These considerations highlight the importance of ensuring that the parties have notice and an opportunity to respond to the sentencing judge’s concerns; the failure to adhere to this procedure is a breach of the duty of procedural fairness. I next turn to discuss the issue of remedy.

C.            Remedy for Breach of the Duty of Procedural Fairness in Sentencing

[89]                        In Lacasse and Friesen, this Court stated that an appellate court can only intervene to vary a sentence if (1) the sentence is demonstrably unfit; or (2) the sentencing judge made an error in principle that had an impact on the sentence (Lacasse, at paras. 41 and 44; Friesen, at para. 26; R. v. Parranto, 2021 SCC 46, at para. 30).

[90]                        This deferential approach to appellate review of sentencing decisions is critical. Parliament chose to grant discretion to sentencing judges to determine the appropriate degree and kind of punishment under the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 (Lacasse, at para. 41; R. v. M. (C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 90; s. 718.3(1) of the Criminal Code). Sentencing judges are in a privileged position and bring “unique qualifications of experience and judgment” to their task (M. (C.A.), at para. 91). And, concerns regarding delay and misuse of judicial resources would arise if appellate courts were to take a more interventionist approach to sentencing appeals (Lacasse, at para. 48).

[91]                        The respondent Crown relies on Lacasse and Friesen to argue that a procedural deficiency in sentencing may justify appellate intervention only if it had an impact on the sentence: “In the absence of an impact on the sentence that was imposed, fairness does not require the appeal court to redo the entire exercise from scratch” (R.F., at para. 67).

[92]                        In my view, it is neither appropriate nor helpful to try to fit the analysis of procedural unfairness into the framework for appellate intervention set out in Lacasse and Friesen. First, these decisions were not concerned with issues of procedural fairness. The sentencing decisions at issue in each case did not involve any breach of procedural fairness. Further, the discussion of the role of appellate courts in these cases focused on their “dual role” of safeguarding against errors and developing the law and providing guidance (Friesen, at para. 34; Lacasse, at paras. 36-37). Because procedural fairness was not at issue, this Court did not comment upon the important role that appellate courts also play in maintaining public respect for the administration of justice by ensuring fairness and the perception of fairness within the criminal justice system (see, e.g., S. (R.D.), at para. 91, per Cory J.; R. v. Walker, 2019 ONCA 765, 381 C.C.C. (3d) 259, at para. 25).

[93]                        Second, issues of procedural fairness are not captured by the Lacasse and Friesen framework because procedural fairness is an independent right. The decisions in Lacasse and Friesen do not detract from this Court’s longstanding recognition that procedural unfairness is an independent basis for reviewing decisions affecting an individual’s rights and interests. In Cardinal v. Director of Kent Institution, 1985 CanLII 23 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 643, at p. 661, this Court stated that “[t]he right to a fair hearing must be regarded as an independent, unqualified right”. Similarly, outside of the administrative law context, this Court in R. v. Tran, 1994 CanLII 56 (SCC), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 951, at p. 981, referred to the “independent responsibility” that courts have “to ensure that their proceedings are fair and in accordance with the principles of natural justice”.

[94]                        Thirdly, given that it is an independent right, the inquiry into procedural fairness is distinct from the inquiry into whether a sentence is unfit or whether there has been an error in principle that impacted the sentence. If the process was unfair, by definition, the basis upon which the sentence was determined is undermined.

[95]                        Procedural fairness asks whether the sentence arrived at was the product of a fair procedure. By contrast, the inquiry into the fitness of a sentence focuses on whether it constitutes an “unreasonable departure” from the fundamental principle of proportionality (Lacasse, at paras. 52-53).

[96]                        Similarly, an assessment of whether there was an error in principle that impacted sentence is separate from an assessment of procedural fairness. Errors in principle include “an error of law, a failure to consider a relevant factor, or erroneous consideration of an aggravating or mitigating factor” (Friesen, at para. 26). The weighing of factors can constitute an error in principle only if the sentencing judge exercised their discretion unreasonably. Whether or not the parties could exercise their right to be heard — a central concern of procedural fairness — is not addressed by the focus on the sentencing judge’s discretion or their application of the principles of sentencing. A breach of procedural fairness impacts the right to a fair hearing and confidence in the exercise of the court’s jurisdiction in reaching the result, regardless of whether or not the result is consistent with the purposes, principles and objectives of sentencing.

[97]                        Additionally, in many cases, it will be impossible for an accused to demonstrate that a breach of procedural fairness had an actual impact on sentence. I agree with the observation from C. C. Ruby, Sentencing (10th ed. 2020), at §3.93, that, “we do not know where on the proper range the sentence would have been fixed if the judge had heard effective submissions”. To give an obvious example, a sentencing judge may reject the Crown’s recommendation as too lenient, without appreciating that the recommendation was justified by deficiencies in the Crown’s case that would have made it difficult to secure a conviction at trial. This information is not something the accused can credibly speak to, to demonstrate how further submissions could have impacted the sentence.

[98]                        In my view, a breach of the duty of procedural fairness in sentencing, in itself, will generally require that the decision of the sentencing judge be set aside. Procedural fairness is an essential aspect of a sentencing hearing.

[99]                        The Crown argues that, where a sentencing judge imposes a more stringent sentence without providing notice or an opportunity for further submissions, there is no meaningful loss of procedural fairness, since a sentence appeal is “the forum which gives the parties the opportunity to make the full argument they were denied in the court below” (R.F., at para. 66). I would not give effect to this submission.

[100]                     The task of an appellate court is fundamentally different when it acts in its appellate function and when it acts as a court of first instance. In the former role, the court begins its examination of the sentence from a position of deference. By contrast, when it concludes that the sentence was the product of an unfair procedure, the sentencing decision must be set aside, and the appellate court “will apply the principles of sentencing afresh to the facts, without deference to the existing sentence” (Friesen, at para. 27).

[101]                     Where a sentencing judge imposes a harsher sentence than the Crown proposes without providing notice or inviting further submissions, the breach of procedural fairness may have had an impact on the sentence precisely because it is not possible to say whether further submissions would have impacted the sentence. In these circumstances, it is necessary to set the decision aside and conduct the sentencing afresh in order to restore fairness and the appearance of fairness to the proceedings. I agree with the Court of Appeal for Ontario that “[i]t is not appropriate to deny procedural fairness during the sentencing process with the expectation that any error can be cured on appeal” (Blake-Samuels, at para. 33). An accused should not have to rely on the appeal process to ensure fairness; rather, “[f]airness should be afforded at all steps” (para. 33).

[102]                     Thus, it is not necessary for the accused to demonstrate that the breach of procedural fairness caused actual prejudice. As the Court stated in Cardinal, “I find it necessary to affirm that the denial of a right to a fair hearing must always render a decision invalid, whether or not it may appear to a reviewing court that the hearing would likely have resulted in a different decision” (p. 661). Similarly, the Court has also recognized that the judgment of a partial adjudicator must be set aside, regardless of the merits of their decision: “The damage created by apprehension of bias cannot be remedied. The hearing, and any subsequent order resulting from it, is void” (R. v. Curragh Inc., 1997 CanLII 381 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 537, at para. 6 (emphasis deleted), citing Newfoundland Telephone Co. v. Newfoundland (Board of Commissioners of Public Utilities), 1992 CanLII 84 (SCC), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 623, at p. 645).

[103]                     A new determination of a fit sentence will be required, because the procedural deficiency may have worked to the prejudice of one of the parties (Kane v. Board of Governors (University of British Columbia), 1980 CanLII 10 (SCC), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1105, at p. 1116). Nonetheless, there are rare circumstances in which a court may exercise its discretion to not grant a remedy for a procedural deficiency where the result is otherwise inevitable (Mobil Oil Canada Ltd. v. Canada‐Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Board, 1994 CanLII 114 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 202, at p. 228; R. v. Papadopoulos (2005), 2005 CanLII 8662 (ON CA), 196 O.A.C. 335, at para. 24; Drapeau v. R., 2020 QCCA 796).

[104]                     In sum, where a sentencing judge fails to advise the parties and invite submissions concerning his or her intention to impose a harsher sentence than the Crown proposes, it is not possible to say whether further submissions would have impacted the sentence. The accused must show that there was a breach of the duty of procedural fairness but need not show actual prejudice. However, in rare cases, the court may choose not to grant a remedy where it is clear that the breach was such that the result was inevitable and public confidence would not be affected.

[105]                     Where a court of appeal determines that there has been a breach of procedural fairness requiring the sentencing decision to be set aside, it must perform its own sentencing analysis without deference to the decision of first instance. In R. v. Sipos, 2014 SCC 47, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 423, at para. 27, this Court recognized that “the predominant view is that there is no authority in the court of appeal to remit the matter to the trial judge for a new sentencing hearing. . . . If the court of appeal finds that there are grounds requiring its intervention, it imposes a fit sentence in what amounts to a new sentencing hearing” (see also Lowry and Lepper). There is no specific provision in the Criminal Code empowering the court of appeal to remit the case back to the sentencing judge (Ruby, at §4.52).

[106]                     In sentencing afresh, the appellate court may reach a decision that coincides with the penalty imposed at first instance, despite the additional submissions and analysis. However, irrespective of the outcome of sentencing afresh, it is essential that fairness and the appearance of fairness have been restored.

III.         Application

[107]                     The appellant, Mr. Nahanee, seeks an order allowing the appeal, and asks this Court to impose a sentence consistent with the Crown and the defence counsel’s sentencing recommendation, or, in the alternative, to refer the matter back to the Court of Appeal for a full and fresh sentencing hearing.

[108]                     I have come to the conclusion that there was a breach of the duty of procedural fairness that requires the sentencing decision to be set aside. The sentencing judge imposed a harsher sentence than what the Crown proposed without providing the requisite notice or opportunity for further submissions.

[109]                     Even accepting that Mr. Nahanee might not have put forward substantively new information in response to an invitation for further submissions, he would have nevertheless been able to make further submissions tailored to the sentencing judge’s concerns. Additionally, it is not known how the Crown would have responded to support its recommendation or how this could have addressed the sentencing judge’s concerns. In these circumstances, we must make sure that justice appears to be done.

IV.         Disposition

[110]                     For the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal and would refer the matter back to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia to perform its own sentencing analysis to determine a fit sentence.

                    Karakatsanis and Martin JJ. —

I.               Overview

[1]                              Parliament and courts have increasingly recognized the grave harms which flow from the wide variety of sexual offences prohibited in the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. Over the years, the substantive elements of some sexual offences have been modified: consent is now expressly defined in the Criminal Code; procedures were introduced to address thorny evidentiary questions; testimonial assistance is available to vulnerable witnesses; and sentencing provisions and principles reflect the seriousness of sexual offences. 

[2]                              In 2004, concerned about the sexual abuse and abduction of children, Parliament passed the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, S.C. 2004, c. 10 (SOIRA or Act). Through this legislation, Parliament sought to help police investigate crimes of a sexual nature by creating a national sex offender registry. At the time, a sex offender would only be placed on the registry if the Crown prosecutor first chose to apply to the court for an order requiring the offender to comply with SOIRA. Moreover, the legislation gave sentencing judges the discretion to exclude offenders from the registry if the effects of the order on their privacy or liberty interests were grossly disproportionate to the public interest in protecting society.

[3]                              These two separate safeguards were removed in 2011 following the enactment of the Protecting Victims From Sex Offenders Act, S.C. 2010, c. 17. Instead, s. 490.012 of the Criminal Code now requires the mandatory registration of all offenders who have been found guilty of any one of the 27 different sexual offences designated in s. 490.011(1)(a). Now each and every such sexual offender is compelled to register their personal information on Canada’s national sex offender registry, regardless of their individual risk of reoffending. In addition to compulsory SOIRA orders, Parliament also imposed a mandatory lifetime registration for offenders who commit more than one offence, irrespective of the nature or timing of the offences and even if they are part of the same transaction (s. 490.013(2.1)).

[4]                              In this case, the appellant, Eugene Ndhlovu, pled guilty in 2015 to two counts of sexual assault against two complainants at a party in 2011. He was 19 years old at the time. At sentencing, the judge was tasked with tailoring a proportionate sentence that was fit in relation to both Mr. Ndhlovu and the sexual assaults he committed. After canvassing his background and the evidence, the judge found that Mr. Ndhlovu was unlikely to reoffend. However, due to Parliament’s amendments in 2011, the Criminal Code obliged the judge to issue an order requiring Mr. Ndhlovu to comply with SOIRA, and for the rest of his life. 

[5]                              As a result, like all other such offenders, he would be required to report to a police station and forced to supply extensive personal information which would be placed on Canada’s national sex offender registry. SOIRA also imposes ongoing reporting requirements which are numerous, invasive and extensive; including that offenders must keep their information up to date, report their plans for any travel lasting seven or more consecutive days and report any change to their home or employment address. He would have to report annually to the police and be subject to random police checks. Non-compliance with any of the reporting obligations associated with registration carries the threat of prosecution, a maximum of two years’ imprisonment, a fine, or both (Criminal Code, s. 490.031(1)). His presence in the database would mean he would be among the list of persons police may consider to be of interest in their investigations, which may generate further interactions with the police. The impact on Mr. Ndhlovu and anyone subject to these provisions is considerable. The scope of the personal information registered, the frequency at which offenders are required to update their information, the ongoing monitoring by the state, and the threat of prosecution and imprisonment all interfere with what it means to be free in Canada.

[6]                              This appeal requires this Court to determine whether Parliament complied with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms when it chose to remove prosecutorial and judicial discretion from s. 490.012 and introduced, under s. 490.013(2.1), lifetime registration for offenders convicted of more than one designated sexual offence. Through s. 490.012, Parliament sought to capture information about offenders that may assist police prevent and investigate sexual offences. Similarly, s. 490.013(2.1) is designed to give police a longer period of access to information on offenders at a greater risk of reoffending.

[7]                              Even when Parliament acts with a laudable purpose, it must still legislate in a constitutional manner and comply with the Charter. It failed to do so when it enacted ss. 490.012 and 490.013(2.1). These measures infringe the liberty interest under s. 7 of the Charter because registration has a serious impact on the freedom of movement and on the freedom to make fundamental choices of people who are not at an increased risk of reoffending over their lifetime.

[8]                             Because the mandatory registration of those offenders who are not at an increased risk of reoffending does not assist police, it is inconsistent with the principle of fundamental justice against overbreadth. Mandatory and lifetime registration overshoot the mark: subjecting sex offenders who do not have an increased risk of reoffending to obligatory reporting requirements is not connected to Parliament’s purpose of capturing information that assists police prevent and investigate sex offences. Requiring lifetime registration also goes too far and denies the rights of some individuals in a way that bears no relation to Parliament’s objective.

[9]                              There are offenders who, because of their individual characteristics, are at a negligible risk of reoffending. Further, the reality is that 75 to 80 percent never reoffend. Based on the Crown’s statistical evidence, there are also a significant number of sex offenders who are at no greater risk of reoffending than members of the general criminal population. As a result, s. 490.012 applies to offenders for whom there is no real possibility that their information may ever assist police — and there is no discretion to exclude such persons from the wide reach of SOIRA’s onerous and ongoing obligations. In addition, the Crown’s expert evidence established that committing more than one sexual offence without an intervening conviction is not associated with a greater risk of reoffending.

[10]                        The two challenged provisions, therefore, suffer from the same constitutional defect. They both use categorical and unyielding proxies that are too broad, resulting in the measures casting too wide a net. To the extent they require the registration, sometimes for life, of offenders who demonstrate no increased risk of reoffending, they threaten the liberty interests of offenders in a manner which is overbroad and violates s. 7 of the Charter.

[11]                        Nor are they justified under s. 1 because they are not minimally impairing of Charter rights and the deleterious effects of the provisions outweigh their salutary ones. The blanket and blunt requirement that all designated sex offenders must be registered, and those convicted of more than one offence must be registered for life, restricts the liberty of offenders who are not at an increased risk of reoffending without any evidence that doing so enhances the ability of police to prevent and investigate sex crimes. While the Crown has asserted that it believes it is necessary to include all offenders for the registry to be as effective as the Crown wants it to be, any such avowal is insufficient to meet its burden of proof under which it is required to justify, not merely explain, the infringement on liberty. Critically, the Crown has adduced no evidence that demonstrates how these provisions are effective in helping police prevent and investigate sex crimes. Indeed, the sparse information in the record points in the opposite direction.

[12]                        We would allow the appeal and declare ss. 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) of no force or effect under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. A one-year suspension of the declaration is appropriate for mandatory registration, given concerns about public safety and the many ways Parliament could remedy the provision’s overbreadth. An immediate declaration, however, is warranted for lifetime registration for offenders convicted of more than one offence.

II.            Facts and Judicial History

A.           Facts

[13]                          Mr. Ndhlovu pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault in June 2015. The convictions resulted from sexual assaults charged on a single indictment against two complainants at a house party in 2011. Mr. Ndhlovu touched both of the complainants’ buttocks and one of the complainant’s thighs. Later in the evening, one of the complainants awoke to Mr. Ndhlovu inserting his fingers inside her vagina. After she motioned to him to stop, he tried to reinsert his fingers. The complainant pushed him and told him to stop, but Mr. Ndhlovu instead tried to remove her bra. The complainant once again told him to stop and he fled. Mr. Ndhlovu was 19 years old at the time of the offences.

B.            Judicial History

(1)         First Instance Proceedings

[14]                          Three proceedings before Moen J. are pertinent to this appeal.

[15]                          The first was a sentencing hearing in which Moen J. was tasked with tailoring a fit and proportional punishment. She found that six months’ imprisonment and three years’ probation were warranted in all the circumstances. In reaching this conclusion, she took into account the characteristics of the offender, as well as the gravity of the offences he committed. She received evidence concerning Mr. Ndhlovu, including a presentence report. She noted that Mr. Ndhlovu took responsibility for his actions and was remorseful. He had no criminal history. His offences related to excessive alcohol consumption, but he had stopped drinking to excess. He had the support of his family and community.

[16]                        Importantly, based on the evidence placed before her by the Crown and defence, the sentencing judge found that Mr. Ndhlovu was “unlikely to offend again” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 38). Moen J. stated that he “will be safe to release into the community. I have absolutely no concerns that [he] will re-offend. Nor does the Crown suggest that [he] will” (p. 38).

[17]                          Despite this finding, due to his conviction for two designated offences, Mr. Ndhlovu was subject to mandatory lifetime registration in Canada’s national sex offender registry pursuant to ss. 490.012(1) and 490.013(2.1) of the Criminal Code. Following sentencing, Mr. Ndhlovu brought an application to challenge both provisions as contrary to ss. 7 and 12 of the Charter.

[18]                          The second hearing addressed whether this mandatory lifetime registration breached those Charter rights. The Crown called the evidence of Det. Arlene May Hove, a police investigator with the Edmonton Police Service (EPS), who was responsible for administering access to the database for police in the Edmonton area.

[19]                          Moen J. concluded ss. 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) breached s. 7 of the Charter (2016 ABQB 595, 44 Alta. L.R. (6th) 382 (ABQB reasons (2016))). The purpose of the provisions was “to protect vulnerable people including children in society, by allowing police quick access to current information on convicted sex offenders” (para. 87). The provisions deprived an offender’s liberty and the deprivation was “quite onerous” given the depth of information, the continuing obligation to report changes, the annual in-person reporting requirements, and the consequences of breaching the order, along with random checks and registration for life (para. 52). She also noted the stigma of being on the registry, the fear that this information may not be kept confidential and how random compliance checks at home and at work risked divulging their registration status.

[20]                          The provisions offended the principles of fundamental justice. While not arbitrary, the provisions were overbroad: registering offenders with little or no recidivism risk, like the appellant, did not advance SOIRA’s purpose. The measures were therefore “broader than necessary” (para. 116). They were also grossly disproportionate, given the onerous cumulative effects of registering. Having found the provisions breached s. 7, Moen J. declined to address the defence’s arguments on s. 12 of the Charter.

[21]                        Following Moen J.’s s. 7 ruling, the Crown sought to justify the provisions under s. 1 of the Charter. A third hearing was held to address whether the provisions were justified under s. 1 and, at this time, the Crown submitted expert evidence from Dr. Robert Karl Hanson about recidivism rates and the risk associated with sexual offenders subsequently committing further offences. The defence called Dr. Kristen Marie Zgoba who gave evidence on recidivism rates and also addressed the efficacy and impact of sex offender registries.

[22]                          Moen J. concluded s. 1 did not save the impugned provisions (2018 ABQB 277, 68 Alta. L.R. (6th) 89). She agreed that the public interest addressed by Parliament was the protection of society through the effective and quick investigation of crimes of a sexual nature by providing police with rapid access to information about known sex offenders. While this was a sufficiently pressing and substantial objective, the means chosen to achieve it was not proportional. Removing judicial discretion and requiring mandatory and sometimes lifetime registration was not rationally connected to this objective, in part because there was no evidence before either her, or the Parliamentary Committee and Senate Committee studying the 2011 amendments, that “there would be more arrests made more quickly as a result of the 2011 amendments” (para. 44). The removal of judicial discretion was not minimally impairing because the Crown “produced no evidence that suggested that judicial discretion had caused any difficulty for the police in their investigations of sexual offences” (para. 110). In addition, the evidence established that the mandatory imposition of lifetime registration does not minimally impair the rights of persons convicted of at least two sexual offences. When comparing registration’s proven costs with the claimed benefits of having everyone on the registry, Moen J. relied heavily on the evidence of the Crown expert to conclude that the deleterious effects of the impugned provisions outweighed any salutary effects. Thus, she declared ss. 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) of no force or effect, and declined to order Mr. Ndhlovu to register.

(2)         Court of Appeal

[23]                        A majority at the Court of Appeal of Alberta (Slatter and Schutz JJ.A.) allowed the Crown’s appeal, concluding that neither provision violated s. 7 (2020 ABCA 307, 12 Alta. L.R. (7th) 225). The majority held the purpose of s. 490.012 was to “require mandatory registration of all sex offenders convicted of designated offences” (para. 74). The fact that all convicted sex offenders have an increased propensity to commit sex crimes in the future provides the necessary connection between mandatory registration under s. 490.012 and the purpose of the legislation. Thus, the measure was not overbroad, since a certain degree of recidivism risk was not a “necessary prerequisite” (para. 95).

[24]                        Lifetime registration was also not overbroad. The majority held the purpose of s. 490.013(2.1) was “to further public safety by subjecting sex offenders who are at enhanced risk of re-offending to a longer period of registration” (para. 103, quoting R. v. Long, 2018 ONCA 282, 45 C.R. (7th) 98, at para. 102). Parliament could infer that committing more than one sexual offence is a proxy for an increased recidivism risk, warranting a longer registration period. Nor were ss. 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) grossly disproportionate. If not strictly modest, the measures were “reasonable and not dissimilar to many other reporting obligations that routinely occur as part of the everyday life of all Canadians, who are state-compelled to provide information from time to time” (para. 130).

[25]                          Khullar J.A., in dissent, disagreed that the provisions complied with s. 7. While she agreed the provisions were not grossly disproportionate, they were overbroad. The provisions had the same purpose as the overall Act: to assist law enforcement in preventing and investigating sexual crimes by centralizing information about convicted sex offenders. It was unnecessary to register offenders at negligible risk of reoffending, like the appellant, to further the provisions’ objective. The Crown’s argument that the difficulties of predicting risk necessitated the registration of all offenders should be addressed under s. 1, as Moen J. concluded. Yet, there was no evidence to show the measures’ salutary effects outweighed their deleterious effects. The breach of the Charter right was not justified.

III.         Issues

[26]                          Mr. Ndhlovu appeals on the ground that the Court of Appeal erred in its determination that ss. 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) of the Criminal Code comply with s. 7 of the Charter. As such, the following issues arise on this appeal:

(a)   Do ss. 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) of the Criminal Code breach s. 7 of the Charter?

(b)   If so, are the breaches justified under s. 1 of the Charter?

(c)   If they are not justified, what is the appropriate remedy?

IV.         Analysis

[27]                        We begin our analysis with a survey of SOIRA, its history and the obligations it imposes on offenders, concluding that the provisions interfere with the liberty interests of those required to register. We turn next to identifying Parliament’s objective in enacting these provisions, ultimately determining that the provisions are overbroad and therefore the limit on liberty is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. Finding a breach of s. 7, we proceed to examine whether the breach is justified under s. 1 of the Charter. We conclude that it is not: ss. 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) are not minimally impairing of Charter rights and the deleterious effects of the provisions outweigh their salutary ones. Finally, we conclude by determining the appropriate remedy.

A.           Sex Offender Information Registration Act

(1)         The Challenged Provisions

[28]                        Two provisions in the Criminal Code which govern the registration of offenders under SOIRA are at issue in this appeal. The first is s. 490.012, which provides that a court “shall” make an order requiring sex offenders convicted of designated offences to comply with SOIRA for the applicable period specified in s. 490.013. Subsection (1) provides: “When a court imposes a sentence on a person for [a] . . . designated offence . . . , it shall make an order in Form 52 requiring the person to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act for the applicable period specified in section 490.013”. Similar language is used in subss. (2) and (3) of the same provision.

[29]                        The second is s. 490.013(2.1), one of several measures that sets out the applicable registration period, or the length of time that an offender is required to comply with SOIRA. The orders have 3 different durations — 10 years, 20 years or life — depending on the maximum punishment for the offence or if the offence was prosecuted summarily. Section 490.013(2.1) provides that “[a]n order made under subsection 490.012(1) applies for life if the person is convicted of . . . more than one . . . designated offence”.

[30]                        Having set out the challenged provisions, we survey SOIRA’s history and canvass the overall scheme and the obligations it imposes on offenders in greater detail.

(2)         The History of SOIRA

[31]                          SOIRA came into force in 2004. SOIRA established a national registry of sex offenders. It was modelled on Ontario’s registry, created by Christopher’s Law (Sex Offender Registry), 2000, S.O. 2000, c. 1 (Christopher’s Law), which was the first registry in Canada. Ontario’s registry was enacted in 2001 following the recommendation of a provincial inquest into the abduction and murder of an 11‑year‑old boy by a convicted sex offender (Library of Parliament, Bill C-16: Sex Offender Information Registration Act, Legislative Summary 470E, February 16, 2004, at p. 8). Parliament followed suit with a national registry after calls mounted for an interprovincial database of sex offenders. Unlike Christopher’s Law, SOIRA is maintained by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, although in conjunction with local and provincial police services who oversee the administration of and access to the registry in designated regions.

[32]                        When SOIRA came into force, it was largely seen as a tool to help police stop the sexual abuse and abduction of children, a type of investigation where “time is of the essence” (House of Commons, Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, Statutory Review of the Sex Offender Information Registry Act: Report of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, 2nd Sess., 40th Parl., December 2009, at pp. 3-4). The Act stated that the registry’s purpose was to help police investigate crimes of a sexual nature (s. 2(1), as it read in 2004). To manage the enrollment of offenders in the registry, Parliament added several measures to the Criminal Code and under these provisions, prosecutors exercised discretion over whether to bring an application to register an offender. Moreover, if prosecutors brought an application, judges could still exempt the offender from the registry if they were “satisfied that the person ha[d] established that, if the order were made, the impact on them, including on their privacy or liberty, would be grossly disproportionate to the public interest in protecting society through the effective investigation of crimes of a sexual nature” (see Criminal Code, s. 490.012(4), as it read in 2004).

[33]                          In 2011, both SOIRA and the Criminal Code were amended by way of the Protecting Victims From Sex Offenders Act. The objective of helping police prevent sex offences was added to SOIRA’s purpose statement in s. 2(1). Further, prosecutorial discretion and judicial discretion to impose SOIRA orders were removed from the provisions of the Criminal Code. From that point forward, s. 490.012 provided that SOIRA orders were mandatory for offenders convicted of designated offences. Parliament also added s. 490.013(2.1) to the Criminal Code, which mandated lifetime registration for individuals convicted of more than one designated offence. The constitutionality of both these amendments is at issue in this case.

[34]                          As well, before the 2011 amendments, police needed to show they were investigating a crime and had reasonable grounds to suspect the crime was of a sexual nature before they could consult the registry (SOIRA, s. 16(2)(a), as it read in 2004). In 2011, however, the reasonable grounds requirement was removed. Thus, since 2011, police are now able to consult the registry to either prevent or investigate sex offences, whether or not they reasonably suspect an offence was or will be committed (SOIRA, s. 16(2)(a)).  

[35]                          Since SOIRA’s inception, many offences have led to registration under the Act. Section 490.011(1)(a) of the Criminal Code presently designates 27 offences that lead to automatic registration under s. 490.012(1) when a sentence is imposed or a verdict of not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder is rendered for those offences. The list of designated offences spans a broad range of criminal activity, including sexual assault, exposure, and withholding or destroying travel documents to facilitate the trafficking of persons under 18 years of age. SOIRA’s ambit is amplified by designated offences like sexual assault, which can be committed in innumerable ways. The conduct captured by sexual assault includes everything from touching a complainant’s buttocks over clothing to prolonged, violent assaults. SOIRA, as a result, captures a highly varied and diverse group of offenders. The number and breadth of designated sexual offences means that the net of sexual offenders subject to SOIRA is itself cast widely — many are subject to its provisions.

[36]                          SOIRA is nearly 20 years old. Despite its long existence, there is little or no concrete evidence of the extent to which it assists police in the prevention and investigation of sex offences. Det. Hove, an investigator with the EPS who administers the registry in the Edmonton region, testified before the sentencing judge; she could only speculate how SOIRA could be used to help the EPS prevent sexual offences. Moreover, she noted she received only about 15 requests from police to access the registry for an investigative purpose in her 2 years administering the registry. The experts at trial were unaware of any study of SOIRA’s efficacy.

(3)         The Legislative Scheme and Reporting Requirements Under SOIRA

[37]                          SOIRA imposes many obligations on offenders to report to a registration centre in person (ss. 4 and 4.1) and provide personal information for the purpose of the registry (s. 5), on an ongoing basis. SOIRA also imposes corresponding obligations on the police officers administering the registry to collect certain information and keep it confidential (s. 8). Access to the information contained in SOIRA is restricted to certain persons, including police who, since 2011, require access for “the purpose of preventing or investigating a crime of a sexual nature” (s. 16(2)(a)).

[38]                        Offenders must comply with SOIRA for the applicable registration period specified under s. 490.013 of the Criminal Code. Offenders, however, can seek a termination order, which (if granted) releases the offender from SOIRA obligations before the end of the applicable registration period (s. 490.016(1)). The order is only granted if a judge is satisfied that continuing the offender’s registration is grossly disproportionate “to the public interest in protecting society through the effective prevention or investigation of crimes of a sexual nature, to be achieved by the registration of information relating to sex offenders under . . . [SOIRA]” (s. 490.016(1)). Moreover, an offender can only bring an application for a termination order after several years have elapsed (s. 490.015(1)). In the case of lifetime registration following a conviction for more than one offence under s. 490.013(2.1), a termination order can be sought 20 years after the order to comply with SOIRA was made (s. 490.015(1)(c)).

[39]                          Registered offenders are subject to many reporting requirements. Following an order made pursuant to s. 490.012(1), offenders must report in person to a registration centre, which are police stations designated with administering the registry in a geographic region. At the centre, the offender must provide extensive personal information, including their name, date of birth, gender, the address of their principal and secondary residences, the address of every place of employment or volunteer location, the name of their employer or volunteer supervisor and a description of the work done, the address of every educational institution at which they are enrolled, their height and weight, a description of every physical distinguishing mark that they have, and the licence plate number, make, model, body type, year of manufacture and colour of every vehicle registered in their name or that they use regularly (SOIRA, s. 5(1)). They must also report a contact phone number for each location where they can be reached and every mobile phone and pager in their possession (s. 5(1)(f)). They must supply information relating to all driver’s licenses and passports they may hold. The registration centre may take their photograph and record their eye colour and hair colour.

[40]                          Offenders must update their information in person yearly (ss. 4(3) and 4.1(1)). They must also report in person at the registration centre any changes in primary or secondary address and name. They must also report in person if they receive a driver’s licence or passport (s. 4.1(1)).

[41]                        Moreover, offenders must notify the registration centre within seven days of any change regarding their employment or volunteering information (ss. 5(1)(d) and 5.1). They must also notify the registration centre if they intend to be away from their primary or secondary residence for seven or more consecutive days (s. 6(1)). Specifically, offenders must notify the registration centre, before departure, of their departure and return dates and of every address or location at which they expect to stay, whether the addresses or locations are in or outside Canada (s. 6(1)(a)). Similar reporting requirements are imposed on offenders who decide, after departure, not to be at their primary or secondary residence for seven or more consecutive days (s. 6(1)(b)).

[42]                          Failing to comply with SOIRA brings serious consequences for offenders. The Criminal Code makes it an offence for an offender to fail to comply with SOIRA’s reporting obligations without “reasonable excuse” (s. 490.031(1)). Non-compliance with any of these conditions may result in prosecution, with penalties of up to 2 years’ imprisonment, up to $10,000 in fines, or both (s. 490.031(1)). The risks are clearly high for offenders if they fail to adhere to SOIRA’s numerous requirements.

[43]                          Further, police officers conduct random compliance checks to verify the information on the registry. At a minimum, offenders are subject to at least one annual verification of their residential address. Det. Hove of the EPS also testified the current policy in Edmonton was to restrict compliance checks to the offender’s primary residence, although SOIRA does not restrict where these checks are carried out. Nothing, as a result, prevents officers from showing up at an offender’s place of employment. Thus, as the sentencing judge found, “offenders on the registry will be subject to further police interference due to the investigatory, and now preventative steps taken by police officers in relation to sex crimes” (ABQB reasons (2016), at para. 59).

[44]                        A number of appellate courts have concluded SOIRA’s reporting requirements have a “minimal” or “modest” impact on registered offenders (see Long, at para. 147; R. v. Debidin, 2008 ONCA 868, 94 O.R. (3d) 421, at para. 82; R. v. Dyck, 2008 ONCA 309, 90 O.R. (3d) 409, at paras. 104-6; R. v. Cross, 2006 NSCA 30, 241 N.S.R. (2d) 349, at paras. 50 and 66; R. v. C. (S.S.), 2008 BCCA 262, 234 C.C.C. (3d) 365, at para. 55). The Court of Appeal in this case, while finding that the measures were “not strictly modest”, equated registration to everyday reporting obligations.

[45]                          With respect, we cannot agree. Rather, the impact on anyone subject to SOIRA’s reporting requirements is considerable. The requirements impact privacy and liberty, personal interests that are fundamental to society: liberty of movement and choice, mobility, and freedom from state monitoring or intrusion in our personal lives. The scope of the personal information registered, the frequency at which offenders are required to update their information, the ongoing monitoring by the state, and, of course, the threat of imprisonment make the conditions onerous. They simply cannot be compared to reporting requirements that “routinely occur as part of the everyday life” such as those associated with filing income tax forms, obtaining a driver’s licence or a passport, or registering with banks or telephone companies (see Dyck, at para. 110).

[46]                        Additionally, the cost of compliance varies from offender to offender based on their life circumstances. While SOIRA’s reporting requirements are always serious, offenders whose job requires regular, prolonged travel will frequently need to take additional measures to remain in compliance. Even worse, offenders who experience homelessness, substance use issues, and cognitive or mental health challenges may find compliance extremely difficult (see, e.g., R. v. J.D.M., 2006 ABCA 294, 417 A.R. 186, at para. 9; R. v. Desmeules, 2006 QCCQ 16773, at paras. 25-27 (CanLII)). Quite simply, we must recognize the full scope of the restrictions that are imposed by SOIRA orders — both physical and informational — to properly assess the constitutionality of ss. 490.012 and 490.013(2.1).

[47]                          The Act thus imposes numerous exacting obligations concerning initial registration, ongoing reporting, state monitoring and possible prosecution and imprisonment. We turn now to consider whether the challenged provisions breach s. 7 of the Charter.

B.            Sections 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) Infringe Section 7 of the Charter

[48]                        Section 7 of the Charter provides that “[e]veryone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.”

[49]                        In order to demonstrate a violation of s. 7, the claimant must first show that the law interferes with their life, liberty or security of the person. Once they have established that s. 7 is engaged, they must then show that the deprivation in question is inconsistent with the principles of fundamental justice (Carter v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 5, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 331, at para. 55).

[50]                        In the first section we conclude that the provisions interfere with the liberty interests of those required to register. We then identify Parliament’s objective in enacting these provisions, ultimately determining that the provisions are overbroad. Finding a breach of s. 7, we next examine whether the breach is justified under s. 1 of the Charter and explain why it is not.

(1)         Sections 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) Interfere With the Offender’s Liberty

[51]                          Underlying the rights in s. 7 is a concern for the protection of individual autonomy and dignity (Carter, at para. 64). Liberty protects “the right to make fundamental personal choices free from state interference” (Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), 2000 SCC 44, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 307, at para. 54; see R. v. Clay, 2003 SCC 75, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 735, at paras. 31-32). Liberty also protects against physical restraint ranging from actual imprisonment or arrest (R. v. Malmo‑Levine, 2003 SCC 74, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 571, at para. 89; Fleming v. Ontario, 2019 SCC 45, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 519, at para. 65) to the use of state power to compel attendance at a particular place (R. v. Beare, 1988 CanLII 126 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 387, at p. 402).

[52]                          The Crown properly concedes SOIRA engages the liberty interest of the accused but argues that the infringement is limited, analogous to fingerprinting, and exists only to the extent SOIRA compels attendance at a particular time and place. The similarities between a mandatory SOIRA order and the fingerprinting order considered in Beare certainly support a finding that s. 7 is engaged here. In Beare, there was a deprivation of liberty because the order obliged “a person to appear at a specific time and place and oblige[d] that person to go through an identification process on pain of imprisonment for failure to comply” (p. 402).

[53]                        However, the nature and extent of the deprivations at issue are much greater here than in Beare. SOIRA does not merely oblige offenders to appear once at a specific time and place and provide one type of personal information. Rather, it creates an ongoing obligation to report extensive information, subject to random checks and other compliance measures, under threat of prosecution and punishment by way of imprisonment, fines, or both. This creates continuous state monitoring that can last decades and for some offenders, like Mr. Ndhlovu, a lifetime.

[54]                        The impact of a SOIRA order on an offender’s liberty can only fairly be described as serious. The most obvious impact on liberty is the risk of prosecution and imprisonment for failure to meet the reporting requirements without “reasonable excuse”. Indeed, there are numerous reported cases involving offenders who have received terms of imprisonment for failing to comply with SOIRA orders (e.g., R. v. D.T., 2021 CanLII 85816 (N.L. Prov. Ct.), at para. 56; R. v. Callahan, 2021 CanLII 41952 (N.L. Prov. Ct.), at para. 62; R. v. Firingstoney, 2017 ABQB 343, at paras. 178‑79 (CanLII); R. v. Caruana, 2016 ONCJ 367, at para. 7 (CanLII)).

[55]                        But the mandatory measures also involve constraints on liberty that are insidious and pervasive for all those who must comply. That offenders must report to a registration centre within tight timelines to provide the information of any changes in primary or secondary address, or name, as well as if they receive a driver’s licence or passport, under threat of penalty, is a clear deprivation of liberty. It compels offenders to structure their travel and residency on an ongoing basis to remain in compliance with SOIRA (see, e.g., R. v. G.E.W., 2006 ABQB 317, 396 A.R. 149, at paras. 19 and 25, where the court considered the impact on an offender who worked in the trucking industry). There are burdens associated with the ongoing obligations to maintain the currency of the information on the registry. The potential of imprisonment makes the deprivation even more severe (Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, 1985 CanLII 81 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at p. 515).

[56]                        As noted above, the impact on liberty can also be aggravated by an offender’s life circumstances. For persons experiencing homelessness or frequent changes in housing, complying with SOIRA’s requirement in s. 4.1(1)(a) to report in person any changes to the location of their “main” residence (regardless of whether they have a formal address) is an extremely onerous obligation, that can be virtually impossible to respect, even more so since it can last for their lifetime.

[57]                          It is clear to us that ss. 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) interfere with offenders’ liberty in serious ways. Liberty is obviously undermined when personal information is collected, under threat of imprisonment, for the very purpose of monitoring a person in the community and promptly identifying the person’s whereabouts in the course of a criminal investigation.

[58]                          Finally, to be clear, we make no finding as to whether SOIRA orders constitute punishment under the K.R.J. test (R. v. K.R.J., 2016 SCC 31, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 906). This question was neither raised nor argued by either party before us, and we would not speculate, without the benefit of submissions, on whether SOIRA orders engage s. 11 of the Charter and, if they do, whether they would survive a Charter challenge.

(2)         The Purpose of Sections 490.012 and 490.013(2.1)

[59]                        The first step in an overbreadth analysis is to determine the purpose of the challenged provisions (R. v. Safarzadeh-Markhali, 2016 SCC 14, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 180, at para. 24; R. v. Moriarity, 2015 SCC 55, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 485, at para. 24). It is to that preliminary question that we now turn.

[60]                          Several principles have emerged to assist a court in properly characterizing a law’s purpose.

[61]                          The focus is on the purpose of the challenged provisions, not of the entire act in which they appear, although a correspondence between those purposes may sometimes occur (Moriarity, at paras. 29 and 48; RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 1995 CanLII 64 (SCC), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 199, at para. 144).

[62]                          The law’s purpose should be succinct, precise, and characterized at the appropriate level of generality, which “resides between the statement of an ‘animating social value’ — which is too general — and a narrow articulation” that amounts to a virtual repetition of the challenged provision, divorced from its context (Safarzadeh‑Markhali, at para. 27, quoting Moriarity, at para. 28).

[63]                          A law’s purpose is distinct from the means used to achieve that purpose (Safarzadeh‑Markhali, at para. 26; Moriarity, at para. 27).

[64]                          To determine an impugned law’s purpose, courts may consider: statements of purpose in the legislation, if any; the text, context, and scheme of the legislation; and extrinsic evidence such as legislative history and evolution (Safarzadeh-Markhali, at para. 31; Moriarity, at para. 31).

[65]                          SOIRA’s overall purpose is readily identified. The statement of purpose in s. 2(1) of SOIRA states the Act aims “to help police services prevent and investigate crimes of a sexual nature by requiring the registration of certain information relating to sex offenders”. In this case, there is no question that the statement of purpose fully reflects Parliament’s aims in enacting SOIRA. Both at the time it was enacted and when it was later amended, Parliament emphasised the Act was designed to assist police. Moreover, it has clearly indicated that SOIRA is intended to assist police in the prevention and investigation of sex offences. However, the challenge in this case is not to the Act as a whole, but is confined to two particular sections of the Criminal Code: one that provides no judicial discretion to exempt offenders from the registry and another that requires lifetime registration for those convicted of more than one designated sexual offence.

[66]                          When assessing the purpose of these challenged provisions, several sources of legislative interpretation closely tie these two provisions to SOIRA’s overall purpose.

[67]                          To begin, SOIRA and ss. 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) of the Criminal Code form an integrated legislative scheme. The provisions subject offenders to the reporting requirements listed in SOIRA. When Parliament enacts related legislation dealing with the same subject, the legislation is presumed to offer a coherent and consistent treatment of the subject (R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at § 13.04). As a result, the provisions must be interpreted in conjunction with the scheme established under the Act. SOIRA’s overall purpose informs the interpretation of the challenged provisions’ purpose.

[68]                          The connection between the purpose of the provisions and SOIRA’s overall purpose is reinforced by other provisions in SOIRA. Section 2(2) of SOIRA lists three principles that must guide the Act’s interpretation. Two emphasize that information collected and disclosed under the Act is intended to assist police prevent and investigate sex offences (s. 2(2)(a) and (c)(i)). Since the Criminal Code provisions similarly affect the scope of information collected in the database, s. 2(2) of SOIRA implies the provisions should be read as closely tied to the overall aim of assisting police.

[69]                          Turning to legislative history, statements made during the amendment process indicate that the specific purpose of mandatory registration is to capture information about offenders that may assist police prevent and investigate sex offences. No extrinsic aids, however, shed light on the purpose of lifetime registration.

[70]                          Mandatory registration was introduced following a report by the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security on SOIRA’s operation and efficacy (Statutory Review of the Sex Offender Information Registry Act: Report of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security). The Standing Committee’s mandate was to identify amendments to ensure the registry is “best able to fulfill the purpose for which it was enacted” (p. 2). Among its recommendations, the report expressed concerns that SOIRA’s inclusion rate was too low. Only around 50 percent of sex offenders were registered in the database (p. 8). The Standing Committee recommended eliminating prosecutorial discretion. Importantly, the Standing Committee concluded that judicial discretion to exempt offenders where the measures were grossly disproportionate should be maintained (p. 9).

[71]                          Parliament, however, opted to eliminate all discretion. Before Parliament, the Minister of Public Safety and his representatives reiterated the Standing Committee’s concerns on SOIRA’s low inclusion rate. The Minister remarked before the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that some recidivistic offenders were “falling through the cracks” because prosecutors were failing to bring applications and judges were excluding offenders when applications were brought (Proceedings of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, No. 3, 3rd Sess., 40th Parl., April 14, 2010, at p. 32). Similarly, in the House of Commons, the Minister’s parliamentary secretary echoed the concerns that SOIRA was under-inclusive and its ability to assist police was undermined as a result (House of Commons Debates, vol. 145, No. 112, 3rd Sess., 40th Parl., December 7, 2010).  

[72]                          The majority at the Court of Appeal concluded that the purpose of mandatory registration was to register all sex offenders. While such a purpose may find some support in parts of the Hansard, we cannot agree with this characterization of the provision’s purpose. First, it replicates the error warned against in Moriarity, at paras. 27‑28: it fails to adequately distinguish between ends and means, which forecloses any separate inquiry into the connection between them. In this way, it immunizes mandatory registration from review for overbreadth. Second, it fails to consider mandatory registration in light of the Act’s overall purpose. Parliament did not enact SOIRA just for the sake of creating a database of all sex offenders. Rather, Parliament enacted SOIRA to create a repository of information that assists police prevent and investigate sex offences.

[73]                          Legislative provisions often encompass a range of objectives: from broad societal values to the specific means enacted to advance those goals. The legislative statements may well include the aspirational goals that animate the legislation, the specific objectives, and the anticipated effect of the provisions. As noted above, the court must articulate the objective of the provision at the appropriate level of generality, in light of the provision itself, the statutory regime and any external evidence. Here, mandatory registration must be interpreted in light of SOIRA’s explicit overall purpose to help police prevent and investigate sex offences. Taking this broader context into account, we conclude the purpose of mandatory registration is to capture information about offenders that may assist police prevent and investigate sex offences.

[74]                          Turning to lifetime registration for more than one offence, we conclude that its purpose is to give police a longer period of access to information on offenders at a greater risk of reoffending. As noted, no legislative history sheds light on the purpose of s. 490.013(2.1). It must be discerned from its text and the overall legislative scheme. To begin, SOIRA imposes lifetime registration periods in several scenarios. Before s. 490.013(2.1) was added in 2011, lifetime registration only applied when an offender committed relatively more serious offences that warrant longer sentences (s. 490.013(2)(c)) or if they were or had been subject to a previous SOIRA order (s. 490.013(3) and (4)). The challenged provision also targets scenarios where more than one offence is committed, but goes further than the former s. 490.013(3) and (4), as it applies where more than one offence was committed whether or not the offender was already subject or was subject at any time to a SOIRA order.

[75]                          Given the language of the provision, in the context of the existing scheme, we agree with the Court of Appeal that Parliament’s basis for seeking a longer period of access when more than one offence is committed must be that it believed that these offenders were more likely to reoffend relative to other sex offenders. Given this greater risk of harm, Parliament preferred to have the offender’s information available on the registry as long as possible. This is consistent with Parliament’s approach to target offenders who commit more serious offences. When s. 490.013(2.1) was introduced in 2011, the Criminal Code already imposed lifetime registration for more serious offences. Parliament appears to have provided for longer registration in the face of a greater risk of harm, either because the offence was more serious (as in s. 490.013(2)(c)), or because the risk of recidivism was higher (s. 490.013(2.1)). Thus, we conclude that the purpose of the measure is to give police a longer period of access to information on offenders at a greater risk of reoffending.

[76]                        In sum, SOIRA was not enacted with complete or total registration as an end in itself. It was enacted to help police prevent and investigate sex offences. The purpose of both challenged measures in the Criminal Code is closely tied to this overall purpose. The specific purpose of s. 490.012 is to capture information about offenders that may assist police prevent and investigate sex offences. The means to achieve this purpose is mandatory registration. Section 490.013(2.1) was similarly designed to give police a longer period of access to information on offenders at a greater risk of reoffending. The means to achieve this purpose is lifetime registration for sex offenders who commit more than one designated offence.

(3)         The Challenged Measures Are Overbroad

[77]                        Having identified the purpose of the measures, the next step is to determine whether they are overbroad. A law is overbroad when it is so broad in scope that it includes some conduct that bears no relation to its purpose, making it arbitrary in part (Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, 2013 SCC 72, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1101, at para. 112). In other words, overbreadth addresses the situation where there is no rational connection between the purpose of the law and some, but not all, of its impacts (para. 112). 

[78]                        The Court in Bedford clarified that a law is overbroad even if it overreaches in only a single case (paras. 113 and 123). A law cannot deprive the life, liberty, or security of the person of even one individual in a way that is inconsistent with the principles of fundamental justice. As a consequence, laws that are broadly drawn to make enforcement more practical run afoul of s. 7 should they deprive the liberty of even one person in a way that does not serve the law’s purpose (para. 113). The Court in Bedford concluded that enforcement practicality may justify a broad law under s. 1 of the Charter (para. 144), but it “is no answer to a charge of overbreadth under s. 7” (Safarzadeh‑Markhali, at para. 53, citing Bedford, at para. 113).

(a)           Mandatory Registration

[79]                        The sentencing judge concluded that mandatory registration (s. 490.012) is overbroad as it leads to the registration of offenders who are not at an increased risk of committing a future sex offence. We agree. As we explained, the purpose of mandatory registration is to capture information about offenders that may assist police prevent and investigate sex offences. Registering offenders who are not at an increased risk of reoffending bears no connection to this purpose. The provision is overbroad.

[80]                        At the s. 1 hearing, the Crown adduced expert evidence on statistical sexual recidivism rates by the testimony of Dr. Hanson, a clinical psychologist. Most of Dr. Hanson’s testimony was focused on structured approaches to conducting risk assessments of sexual offending. According to this expert evidence, however, the majority of sexual offenders — about 75 to 80 percent — never actually reoffend. Before the sentencing judge, the Crown conceded that the registry captures people who will never reoffend.

[81]                        To overcome that hurdle, the Crown relies on two interrelated arguments. First, it argues the connection between the effects of s. 490.012 on all offenders and its objective is predicated on the fact that, although not all sexual offenders reoffend, they are, as a group, all at an enhanced risk of reoffending based on statistical evidence. A conviction is a logical, practical and sufficient proxy for an enhanced risk of committing a sexual offence. Second, there are no reliable means to identify those who are not at an enhanced risk to reoffend at sentencing.

[82]                        As we will demonstrate, however, the Crown’s submissions are flawed. We proceed in three parts. First, the Crown’s reasoning ignores that some individual circumstances may allow a court to identify offenders that are not at an increased recidivism risk. Second, the Crown’s position is not supported by the expert statistical evidence presented at trial: it is inaccurate to say that all sexual offenders are at an enhanced risk of reoffending. Third, the overbroad nature of s. 490.012 cannot be salvaged by the difficulty with risk assessments at sentencing: such arguments should be dealt with under s. 1.

[83]                        To summarize our analysis, we see no error in the sentencing judge’s or Khullar J.A.’s conclusion that including offenders who are not at an increased risk of reoffending on the registry bears no connection to mandatory registration’s purpose. Subjecting all offenders, regardless of their future risk, to continuing and onerous reporting requirements, random compliance checks, possible prosecution, and imprisonment does not bear a connection to the purpose of the measure. In this case, Moen J. found at first instance, based on evidence at the sentencing hearing, that Mr. Ndhlovu was such an offender: she had “absolutely no concerns that [he] will re‑offend”.

[84]                        The extent to which requiring all offenders to register is necessary due to the difficulties in assessing risk is an argument grounded in enforcement practicality or administrative convenience. It relates to justification rather than overbreadth. While mandatory registration has the attraction of simplicity and ease, the convenience of requiring every sex offender to register does not make it constitutional.

(i)            An Offender’s Personal Circumstances May Show There Is No Increased Risk of Reoffending

[85]                        The Crown’s focus on the recidivism risk of sex offenders faces an obvious difficulty. In certain cases, an offender’s personal circumstances mean they are not at an increased risk of reoffending, undermining any real possibility that their information on the registry will ever prove useful to police. But a rough proxy like a prior conviction for a sex offence does not readily account for those circumstances. This common sense argument is consistent with the Crown expert’s testimony.

[86]                        Trials based on historical sexual offences are commonplace in our courts. An offender who committed a sexual offence in the past is sometimes only convicted and sentenced decades later, when they are at an advanced age and have highly limited mobility. Subjecting such offenders to SOIRA would obviously bear no connection to the purpose of capturing information about offenders that may assist police prevent and investigate sex offences. The conclusion that these personal circumstances may have a bearing on recidivism risk, yet are not captured in statistical models, is consistent with the Crown expert’s testimony.

[87]                        The Crown’s expert, Dr. Hanson, rightly admitted the limitations on the statistics that formed the basis of his testimony. He recognized statistical models have inherent limits: even the best studies or models cannot account for all personal characteristics that influence one’s likelihood of reoffending. Bearing in mind that an effect on one person’s liberty that bears no connection to s. 490.012’s purpose is sufficient to make it overbroad (Bedford, at para. 123), the breach here becomes obvious. We are satisfied that the personal circumstances of some offenders mean they are at no increased risk of reoffending.

[88]                        Consider, for instance, the offender in R. v. T.L.B., 2006 ABQB 533, 403 A.R. 293, aff’d 2007 ABCA 135, 404 A.R. 283. The offender was wheelchair‑bound due to cerebral palsy, unable to work, and required daily assistance from a caregiver to assist with her personal needs (paras. 8-9). She was convicted of child pornography and sexual interference offences involving her six-year-old child. She was pressured to make images of her child and to commit a sexual act with her son after entering into an online relationship with a man who was a pedophile (paras. 2-7). After the incident was disclosed, her son was apprehended from her care (para. 6). At sentencing, T.L.B. was exempted from complying with SOIRA — under the previous provisions — on the grounds it would be “grossly disproportionate” (para. 80). Her risk of reoffending was very low based on the assessment of a clinical and forensic psychologist (para. 65). Her offences were directed against her child, who was no longer in her care, and she did not have contact with any other children (para. 65).

[89]                        T.L.B.’s personal circumstances make it highly improbable that she would reoffend. There is no increased risk that an offender like T.L.B. would ever commit another sex offence. Nor did anything in her pattern of offending suggest that her location or identity would not be readily ascertainable without SOIRA if police investigated her for a future offence. As a result, her registration would not be connected to the objective of capturing information about offenders that may assist police prevent and investigate sex offences. Focusing only on T.L.B.’s convictions neglects all of the unique circumstances in her case that make it highly improbable that police would ever benefit from her registration.

[90]                        These examples illustrate the constitutional infirmity of s. 490.012 under s. 7. The question is not whether sexual offenders are generally at an increased risk of reoffending, but rather whether there are some offenders who are not. This is because a law that has an overbroad impact on even one individual is inconsistent with the principles of fundamental justice (Bedford, at para. 123). As T.L.B. illustrates, in some cases, the personal circumstances of an offender will undermine any increased risk of reoffending. There is, as a result, no connection between subjecting an offender like T.L.B. to SOIRA and the purpose of capturing information that may assist police prevent and investigate sex offences.

(ii)         Mandatory Registration Is Overbroad Since Some Sex Offenders Are Not at an Increased Statistical Risk of Reoffending

[91]                          The expert evidence, which the sentencing judge accepted, made clear that there is no perceptible difference in sexual recidivism risk at the time of sentencing between the lowest-risk sexual offenders — the bottom 10 percent — and the population of offenders with convictions for non-sexual criminal offences. In both instances, about two percent of individuals — whether they be the lowest-risk sexual offenders or the people with a criminal record unrelated to a sexual offence — commit a sexual offence over the next five years.

[92]                          Mandatory registration is overbroad to the extent it sweeps in these lowest‑risk sex offenders. As a result of their risk profile, there is no connection between subjecting them to a SOIRA order and the objective of capturing information that may assist police prevent and investigate sex offences because they are not at an increased risk of reoffending. The purpose of the provision is not advanced by including these offenders.

[93]                          The Crown nevertheless contends that the measures are not overbroad since sex offenders are, as a group, at an enhanced risk of recidivism. It adds that even the lowest-risk sex offender is more dangerous than members of the general public. It further argues that, in any event, all sexual offenders present a more than de minimis risk of committing a further sexual offence and that Parliament is entitled to legislate in order to mitigate this risk of harm. In our view, none of these arguments is sufficient to cure the provision’s overbreadth.

[94]                          First, we agree that the commission of a sexual offence is one of many empirically validated predictors of increased sexual recidivism. But so are other factors, such as age, unusual or atypical sexual interests, sexual preoccupation, lifestyle instability or poor cognitive problem solving (to name a few). Recidivism risk also varies depending on the pattern of offences: for instance, whether the offence is a non‑contact sexual offence, or whether it is committed against a child, a stranger, an acquaintance or a family member. Yet the expert evidence makes clear that valid risk assessments must consider a range of risk relevant variables — there is no single factor that, on its own, yields an offender’s recidivism risk. In short, many factors affect a sex offender’s recidivism risk.

[95]                          As a result, although an offender may be part of a group that is generally — in other words, on average — at an enhanced risk of reoffending, this does not hold true for every individual in the group. To be clear, an overbreadth analysis does not focus on the group, but on the individuals within that group. As explained above, while a previous conviction for a sexual offence is a risk factor, about 10 percent of the individuals with a prior conviction for a sex offence are not, at time of sentencing, at an enhanced risk of reoffending when compared to the general criminal population. Focusing only on the commission of a past sexual offence inevitably detracts the focus from the other variables affecting an offender’s recidivism risk. This is hardly surprising, considering that sexual offences cover a broad range of conduct and that sex offenders are not a uniform group.

[96]                          Second, there is no evidence to support the Crown’s reliance on an enhanced rate of offending relative to the general public. The Crown’s own expert could only speculate and testified that the rate of sexual offending by those without any prior conviction for any offence had not been established.

[97]                          Third, a de minimis risk of harm or risk of reoffending is insufficient to avoid overbreadth. The Crown relies on Malmo-Levine for the proposition that Parliament is entitled to enact measures that mitigate a more than de minimis risk of harm, a point accepted by the majority at the Court of Appeal (para. 89). Since all sex offenders are allegedly at a more than de minimis risk of reoffending, the Crown says Parliament complied with s. 7 when it elected to include relatively low-risk offenders in the registry.

[98]                        As we note above, only about 20 to 25 percent of the sex offender group actually reoffend, and 10 percent of the group are at about a 2 percent chance of reoffending after 5 years. And within the rates of recidivism, the range of conduct captured — and the degree of harm — varies dramatically. Nonetheless, we agree that “the precise weighing and calculation of the nature and extent of the harm is Parliament’s job” (Malmo-Levine, at para. 133). However, the question in an overbreadth analysis is not whether Parliament perceived a more than de minimis risk of harm when it enacted a law. Rather, the question is whether the law is so broad in scope that it has some impact on a s. 7 interest that bears no connection to the law’s purpose (Bedford, at para. 112).

[99]                        The difference between these two questions is illustrated by an early decision in this Court’s overbreadth jurisprudence, R. v. Heywood, 1994 CanLII 34 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 761. In Heywood, the Court considered a provision that made it an offence for certain offenders to loiter in or near school grounds, playgrounds, public parks, or bathing areas (then s. 179(1)(b) of the Criminal Code). The purpose of the measure was to protect children from becoming victims of sexual offences (p. 794). The Court struck down the measure for overbreadth because it applied to locations where children were not likely to be present, such as every part of all public parks in Canada, including vast and remote wilderness parks (p. 795). Clearly, however, the measure applied to sex offenders who would, according to the Crown’s logic, pose a more than de minimis risk of harm. Nevertheless, the provision breached s. 7 of the Charter because it impacted the liberty of offenders in a manner that bore no connection to its purpose. While Heywood predates Bedford and Carter, it remains a paradigmatic application of the overbreadth principle (H. Stewart, Fundamental Justice: Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (2nd ed. 2019), at p. 154).

[100]                     Quite simply, the Crown cannot rely on the fact that any offender has a risk — albeit not an increased risk — to commit a sexual offence in the future. If a mere risk of committing a future criminal offence could provide the requisite connection to meet the Bedford threshold, such a threshold would be met, by reason of logic, in every case where forward-looking measures are implemented by Parliament. If one accepts the basic premise that it is impossible to predict the future with absolute certainty, then, by definition, anyone has a risk of committing a criminal offence in the future. If risk is all it takes to make a measure depriving individuals from their liberty compliant with s. 7, the law on overbreadth would be deprived of its normative value.

[101]                     In the end, the evidence — accepted by the sentencing judge — demonstrates that s. 490.012 catches offenders who, at the time of their release, are no longer at significant risk to reoffend. The commission of a past sexual offence, therefore, is an inexact proxy for those offenders whose information may assist police. A proxy of such a broad nature, which applies to a large number of people and a broad range of conduct, inevitably captures individuals who are not at an increased risk of committing the criminal conduct that Parliament sought to prevent and investigate with the registry.

(iii)        Uncertainty at Sentencing Cannot Cure Section 490.012’s Overbreadth

[102]                     The Crown submits s. 490.012 is not overbroad, since the risk of recidivism is difficult to assess and even expert assessments are error-prone. Thus, it says, there is no other alternative that would capture the information to assist police. There are two difficulties with the Crown’s argument.

[103]                     First, as discussed above, the Crown cannot save a law from overbreadth for reasons of “administrative convenience” or to make enforcement more practical (Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, 1985 CanLII 65 (SCC), [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177, at p. 219; see Bedford, at para. 113; Carter, at para. 88; Safarzadeh-Markhali, at para. 53). As the Crown relies on the same concern here, it does not save mandatory registration under s. 7, but must be addressed under s. 1.

[104]                     It is worth elaborating on why questions of enforcement practicality are generally not addressed under s. 7 of the Charter. This type of argument implicitly accepts that an individual’s rights are breached but holds it is justified for the sake of a benefit to the public — making the administration or enforcement of a law more practical or convenient. As a result, the argument goes to the heart of the s. 1 analysis: the justification of a breach of an individual’s rights in pursuit of a greater public good (i.e., laws that are easier to enforce or administer), rather than the “narrower” question under s. 7, which concerns “whether the impugned law infringes individual rights” (Bedford, at para. 125). Considerations of enforcement practicality balance harm to an individual’s rights against a benefit to the public and so fall at the core of s. 1. They are appropriately addressed as part of the Crown’s burden under s. 1 as a result.

[105]                     Since Bedford, the Court has consistently rejected arguments premised on enforcement practicality and administrative convenience under s. 7 of the Charter. In Bedford, the Court concluded that the criminal offence of living on the avails of prostitution was overbroad. The purpose of the offence was “to target pimps and the parasitic, exploitative conduct in which they engage” (para. 137). The offence was overbroad to the extent it captured persons who were not in exploitative business relationships with sex workers, including accountants and receptionists (para. 142). The Attorneys General of Canada and Ontario argued the law needed to be broadly drawn due to the blurry line between exploitative and non-exploitative relationships (para. 143). The Court concluded this argument, premised on enforcement practicality, was better addressed under s. 1 of the Charter (para. 144).

[106]                     Later, in Carter, the Court considered a challenge to a criminal prohibition on assisted dying. The purpose of the prohibition was to protect vulnerable individuals from committing suicide in a moment of weakness (para. 78). The Court concluded the prohibition was overbroad to the extent it applied to individuals who were not vulnerable (para. 86). In reaching this conclusion, the Court rejected the Crown’s argument that the law needed to be broadly drawn due to the difficulty of conclusively identifying vulnerable individuals (paras. 87-88). The Court again held this argument was properly addressed under s. 1 (para. 88).

[107]                     A year later, in Safarzadeh‑Markhali, the Court considered a challenge to a provision that barred offenders who were denied bail due to a prior conviction from receiving enhanced credit for presentence custody. The provision’s purpose was “to enhance public safety and security by increasing violent and chronic offenders’ access to rehabilitation programs” (para. 47 (emphasis deleted)). The Court concluded it was overbroad since it applied to offenders who did not pose a threat to public safety or security, including those denied bail for non-violent prior offences, such as missing a court date (paras. 52-53). The Crown argued that the provision cast a broad net since that was more practical than identifying only those offenders that posed a public safety risk (para. 53). The Court, citing Bedford, held this concern for enforcement practicality did not save the provision from overbreadth under s. 7 (para. 53).

[108]                     Bedford, Carter, and Safarzadeh-Markhali all affirm that Parliament cannot rely on enforcement practicality or administrative convenience to immunize a law from overbreadth under s. 7 of the Charter. The proper approach is to address such considerations under s. 1. The Crown’s attempts to rely on enforcement practicality under s. 7 similarly fail in this case.

[109]                     Moreover, judges make risk assessments routinely, including those informed by expert assessments. Notwithstanding these assessments may not be certain, they are capable of being well informed by an individual’s personal circumstances and the best expert evidence. Clearly, there are instances where a sentencing judge can reasonably conclude that it is remote or implausible that an offender’s information will ever prove useful to police.

[110]                     Finally, in the past, judges may have improperly exempted offenders on the basis of gross disproportionality by relying on myths and stereotypes about sexual assaults (see J. Benedet, “A Victim-Centred Evaluation of the Federal Sex Offender Registry” (2012), 37 Queen’s L.J. 437). To the extent some trial judges may have interpreted the former exemption too broadly, those trial decisions are always subject to appellate review and guidance. This cannot render an unconstitutional law constitutional.

[111]                     Thus, mandatory registration is overbroad. Since it captures offenders who are not at an increased risk to reoffend, s. 490.012 breaches s. 7 of the Charter.

(b)         Lifetime Registration

[112]                     Lifetime registration of those convicted of more than one sexual offence (s. 490.013(2.1)) is also overbroad.

[113]                     The Crown’s expert distinguished between two categories of offenders who commit more than one offence. The first is an offender, like Mr. Ndhlovu, who commits more than one sex offence without an intervening conviction. The second is an offender who, after being convicted of a sex offence, goes on to commit another offence. Dr. Hanson explained that committing more than one offence without an intervening conviction is not associated with an enhanced recidivism risk. As he put it, “individuals who are convicted of . . . two or three offences at the same sentencing occasion are the same risk as an individual who is convicted of one” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 196). He noted, however, that committing another offence after a conviction did substantially increase recidivism risk.

[114]                     Dr. Hanson’s evidence establishes that lifetime registration for more than one offence without an intervening conviction is overbroad. The purpose of the measure is to give police a longer period of access to information on offenders at a greater risk of reoffending. Yet, as the expert evidence establishes, the measure captures some offenders who are not at a relatively greater risk of reoffending because their two or more offences were committed, for example, in a single transaction. Section 490.013(2.1), however, provides no discretion to exempt offenders in this circumstance.

[115]                     The Crown submits Parliament was entitled to rely on a common sense inference that committing more than one offence on a single occasion increases recidivism risk. We would not give effect to this argument. The expert evidence clearly undermines the plausibility of any such inference. For this reason, we agree with the defence that s. 490.013(2.1) is overbroad.

(4)         Gross Disproportionality

[116]                     Having concluded the measures are overbroad, we need not decide whether they are grossly disproportionate. That said, we would not foreclose the possibility that the effects of the provisions may be grossly disproportionate to their purposes in some cases. As discussed above, the impact on anyone who is subject to the reporting requirements of a SOIRA order is considerable. The personal information registered, the frequency at which offenders are required to update their information and the threat of imprisonment make the conditions onerous. They are not routine reporting requirements. Section 490.012 previously allowed for an exemption to ensure no individual would be subject to a grossly disproportionate order. That option, however, is no longer available.

C.            Sections 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) Are Not Justified Under Section 1 of the Charter

[117]                     Having concluded that ss. 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) breach s. 7 of the Charter, it remains to determine whether the measures can be justified under s. 1. The Crown submits the measures are saved by s. 1. We do not accept this submission.

[118]                     The Crown bears the burden of establishing that the challenged measures’ infringement of s. 7 is justified under s. 1 of the Charter. To meet its burden under s. 1, the Crown must show the infringement is “demonstrably justified”, which means the infringing measures must be justified based on a “rational inference from evidence or established truths” (RJR-MacDonald, at para. 128). Bare assertions will not suffice: evidence, supplemented by common sense and inference, is needed (R. v. Sharpe, 2001 SCC 2, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45, at para. 78).

[119]                     A breach of the Charter is justified under s. 1 when the challenged law has a “pressing and substantial object and . . . the means chosen are proportional to that object” (Carter, at para. 94). The law is proportionate where the means adopted are rationally connected to the law’s objective, minimally impairing of the right in question, and the law’s salutary effects outweigh its deleterious effects (R. v. Oakes, 1986 CanLII 46 (SCC), [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, at pp. 136-40). The focus of the analysis is on the infringing measures, not on the overall legislative scheme. Thus, the Crown’s burden requires it to show the challenged measures, and not SOIRA as a whole, impose a reasonable limit on s. 7 (Ontario (Attorney General) v. G, 2020 SCC 38, at para. 72, citing RJR‑MacDonald, at para. 144; Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada, 2010 SCC 21, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 721, at para. 20).

[120]                     The defence concedes that the prevention and investigation of sex crimes is a pressing and substantial purpose. We agree. Parliament’s goals in enacting SOIRA are laudable. In our view, this holds true for the specific objectives of the provisions at issue. Parliament’s efforts to provide tools to police that make it easier to prevent and investigate sex offences are clearly aligned with the public’s interest in preventing sex crimes and bringing sex offenders to justice.

[121]                     Furthermore, the measures are rationally connected to their objectives. The standard is not onerous; Oakes requires a rational connection, not a complete rational correspondence (R. v. Appulonappa, 2015 SCC 59, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 754, at para. 80; Health Services and Support — Facilities Subsector Bargaining Assn. v. British Columbia, 2007 SCC 27, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 391, at para. 148). This test is met here. Since a conviction for a sexual offence is a reliable indicator of an increased risk of reoffending and committing another sex offence after a conviction can increase recidivism risk, it is reasonable to suppose the provisions may further their respective objectives (Alberta v. Hutterian Brethren of Wilson Colony, 2009 SCC 37, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 567, at para. 48). Yet, as we explain, the measures fail the other branches of the Oakes test.

(1)         Sections 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) Are Not Minimally Impairing of an Offender’s Rights

[122]                     A key issue on this appeal is whether the measures are minimally impairing of an offender’s rights. To be minimally impairing, the challenged provisions must interfere with s. 7 “as little as reasonably possible in order to achieve the[ir] legislative objective” (RJR-MacDonald, at para. 160). The analysis turns on whether there are alternative, less drastic means of achieving the objective in a real and substantial manner (K.R.J., at para. 70). The Crown bears the burden of showing no less drastic means are available (Safarzadeh-Markhali, at para. 63). A court need not find that the alternative measures “satisfy the objective to exactly the same extent or degree as the impugned measure[s]” (Hutterian Brethren, at para. 55 (emphasis in original)). Instead, it suffices that the alternative measures “substantially” achieve the challenged measures’ objective (paras. 55 and 60). For this reason, the Court in G rejected the Crown’s argument that since recidivism risk could not be perfectly predicted, the mandatory and permanent registration of offenders who were found not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder in Ontario’s sex offender registry was minimally impairing. The Court concluded that absolute certainty in risk assessments cannot be expected (para. 75). For similar reasons, we conclude the Crown has not discharged its burden on this step. 

[123]                     The Crown argues that mandatory SOIRA orders (s. 490.012) are necessary to achieve “Parliament’s objective of providing police with a comprehensive source of information on convicted sexual offenders, and particularly those who reoffend” and “to achieve an offender inclusion rate similar to that of the Ontario registry” (R.F., at paras. 162-63). This argument, however, is based on a flawed premise, since it mischaracterizes s. 490.012’s objective. As stated above, the purpose is to capture information about offenders that may assist police prevent and investigate sex offences. The means chosen is the registration of all sex offenders. The Crown’s argument under minimal impairment inappropriately shifts the characterization of mandatory registration’s purpose.

[124]                     When the purpose of mandatory registration is properly characterized, it is apparent that the Crown has not met its burden under minimal impairment. To begin, the Crown concedes that restoring judicial discretion in the registration process would allow for a 90 percent inclusion rate of offenders in the registry. Yet the Crown did not adduce any evidence to explain why an inclusion rate of 90 percent would not substantially achieve s. 490.012’s purpose of capturing information that assists police prevent and investigate sex offences. Specifically, no evidence or plausible argument was provided to explain why a discretion to exclude offenders from SOIRA where the impacts are likely too onerous or unrelated to s. 490.012’s purpose would not substantially achieve Parliament’s aims. In fact, the Crown did not adduce any evidence about the difficulties faced by police in preventing or investigating sexual offences before 2011, when a form of judicial discretion was in place. Indeed, the Crown’s expert, Dr. Hanson, was unable to find any study of SOIRA’s efficacy or consequences before the 2011 amendments.

[125]                     There is also no persuasive evidence that the difficulties in assessing recidivism risk renders judicial discretion incompatible with Parliament’s goals. Judges frequently assess risk. As noted, this Court said in G at the minimal impairment stage, “[i]ndividual assessment does not need to perfectly predict risk — certainty cannot be the standard” (para. 75). A variety of tools are available to improve the accuracy of judicial risk assessments, including expert evidence. Alternatively, Parliament can enumerate specific criteria to guide judges on when registering an offender is unlikely to advance the scheme’s objective. We do not accept the Crown’s submission that reliable, tailored alternatives are simply not available. There is, it would seem, a variety of measures that Parliament may introduce, keeping in mind the measures must neither be overbroad nor grossly disproportionate.

[126]                     In essence, the Crown’s argument rests on the proposition that all offenders must be registered unless the defence can demonstrate that judicial discretion will not hamper the police’s ability to prevent and investigate sex offences. The unproven premise is that police can only effectively prevent and investigate sex offences if all designated offenders are registered. The assumption appears to be that if some are good, more is better, and all is best. The Court in Carter rejected a similar argument at the minimal impairment stage because it “effectively reverses the onus under s. 1, requiring the claimant whose rights are infringed to prove less invasive ways of achieving the prohibition’s object” (para. 118). The same concern in Carter arises in this case. It is the Crown, not Mr. Ndhlovu, who bears the burden under s. 1. Rather than call evidence that shows less infringing measures would fail to substantially achieve the measure’s objective, the Crown relies on assertion and conjecture. That is not enough to meet its burden under s. 1. As the Court stated in Carter, at para. 119, “[j]ustification under s. 1 is a process of demonstration, not intuition or automatic deference to the government’s assertion of risk” (citing RJR-MacDonald, at para. 128).

[127]                     Nor has the Crown met its burden on lifetime registration (s. 490.013(2.1)). As noted, the expert evidence indicates that offenders who commit more than one offence without an intervening conviction have no increased recidivism rate relative to offenders who commit a single offence. The Crown has not explained why exempting this category of offenders would not achieve s. 490.013(2.1)’s purpose — that is, to give police a longer period of access to information on offenders at a greater risk of reoffending — in a real and substantial manner.

[128]                     Consequently, as in G, the Crown has failed to tender the evidence needed to discharge its burden at the minimal impairment stage. There is no basis on which to conclude that alternative measures do not achieve the purpose of ss. 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) in a real and substantial manner.

(2)         Sections 490.012 and 490.013(2.1)’s Deleterious Effects Outweigh Their Salutary Effects

[129]                     At the heart of the s. 1 analysis is the determination of whether the salutary effects outweigh the negative impacts of the challenged measures. This is the final stage of the proportionality inquiry in Oakes. We conclude that the Crown has also not met its burden at this stage.

[130]                     The final stage requires a court to weigh the harm to the claimant’s rights against the public benefits conferred by the challenged measure, by asking whether “the benefits which accrue from the limitation [of the claimant’s rights] are proportional to its deleterious effects” (K.R.J., at para. 77, quoting Thomson Newspapers Co. v. Canada (Attorney General), 1998 CanLII 829 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 877, at para. 125). The final stage of the Oakes test, as a result, involves a broader assessment than in the prior stages of “whether the benefits of the impugned law are worth the cost of the rights limitation” (Hutterian Brethren, at para. 77). Benefits that are speculative and marginal in nature carry less weight when balanced against a measure’s significant and tangible deleterious effects (K.R.J., at para. 92; Thomson Newspapers Co., at paras. 129-30).

[131]                     The Crown’s evidence on the challenged measures’ benefits is insufficient to meet its burden under s. 1. The goal of capturing information that assists police to prevent and investigate sex offences is obviously an important consideration in whether the provisions’ overbreadth is justified under s. 1. So too is the aim of giving police longer access to the information of offenders at greater risk of reoffending. To the extent the provisions succeed, they are strongly in the public interest.

[132]                     The Crown’s arguments on the benefits of ss. 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) are premised on the alleged benefits flowing from the sex offender registry. The Crown’s evidence on its efficacy was, however, limited, both on the investigation and prevention of sexual offences. The Crown cites evidence in its factum regarding the general benefits of sex offender registries. Specifically, it relies on Dr. Zgoba’s testimony that some studies in the United States found registries may assist police in detaining offenders more quickly if they reoffend. Yet the experts also testified that the United States’ registries were public and therefore not comparable to SOIRA. The Crown, moreover, identified no cases where SOIRA helped police solve or prevent a sex offence, either before or after the challenged measures were introduced. In fact, at the s. 1 hearing, the Crown called the registry’s national database manager with the RCMP and, on cross-examination, he testified that he was unaware of any offences that were solved using SOIRA.

[133]                     It is, moreover, unclear how SOIRA could even prevent a sex offence. Det. Hove provided only a hypothetical example where the police used the database to intercept an offender after witnessing some suspicious behaviour. In theory, of course, the registry might prevent offences if a serial offender is apprehended using it, preventing future assaults by that person, but no evidence was adduced to support this hypothesis.

[134]                     More significantly, the Crown has adduced no evidence that demonstrates the salutary effects of the challenged measures. Under s. 1, the onus is on the Crown to justify the specific infringing measures, not the overall scheme (G, at para. 72). The Crown did not adduce any evidence on the difficulties that police faced in investigating sexual offences with SOIRA before the 2011 amendments and how the amendments mitigated these difficulties. No evidence was adduced to demonstrate the benefit of registering every sex offender, without regard for their risk of reoffending. To the contrary, we note that Dr. Hanson, the Crown’s own expert, testified that “[b]lanket policies that treat all sex offenders as ‘high risk’ waste resources by over-supervising lower risk offenders and risk diverting resources from the truly high-risk offenders who could benefit from increased supervision and human service” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 236). No more evidence was presented on the benefits that flow from police having longer access to the information of offenders who have committed multiple offences without an intervening conviction.

[135]                     In this case, we must weigh those potential and theoretical benefits against the impact on registrants. The impact on anyone who is subject to the reporting requirements of a SOIRA order is considerable. To reiterate, SOIRA’s reporting requirements are not routine: the scope of the personal information registered, the frequency at which offenders are required to update their information and, above all, the threat of imprisonment make the conditions onerous. Additionally, these effects are more acute when considering their effects on marginalized populations, such as people experiencing homelessness. Considering these deleterious impacts, the sparse evidence on the provisions’ benefits and the fact that the registration of approximately 10 percent of offenders who have the lowest recidivism risk does not serve the provisions’ purpose, we conclude the Crown did not meet its burden at this stage either. As result, the Crown has not shown that ss. 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) are saved under s. 1 of the Charter.

V.           Result and Remedy

[136]                     We would allow the appeal and declare ss. 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) of no force or effect under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. On mandatory registration, we find a one-year suspension of the declaration is appropriate given concerns about public safety and since there are many ways Parliament could address the legislative gap for individualized assessment (G, at para. 165). An immediate declaration, however, is appropriate for lifetime registration.

[137]                     The framework governing Charter remedies was recently revisited in G. Once the court has determined the extent of the law’s inconsistency with the Charter (para. 160), the next step is to determine whether a tailored remedy would be appropriate (such as reading down, reading in, or severance), rather than a declaration of invalidity applying to the whole of the challenged law (para. 163).

A.           Section 490.012

[138]                     The Crown submits that “[a] tailored remedy is not appropriate in this case” (R.F., at para. 175). Since the issue is the mandatory registration of all sex offenders, its unconstitutionality does not lend itself to such a remedy. As the Crown notes, reading down s. 490.012 so that it would simply not apply to offenders who are not at an increased risk of reoffending or who suffer grossly disproportionate impacts would, in practice, reinstate judicial discretion and contradict Parliament’s clear intention to remove all judicial discretion to exempt offenders at the time of sentencing from the registry (R. v. Boudreault, 2018 SCC 58, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 599, at para. 100; Schachter v. Canada, 1992 CanLII 74 (SCC), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 679, at p. 718). We agree with the Crown that the appropriate remedy is a declaration of invalidity.

[139]                     Declarations should be suspended when the government demonstrates that “an immediately effective declaration of invalidity would endanger an interest of such great importance that, on balance, the benefits of delaying the effect of that declaration outweigh the cost of preserving an unconstitutional law that violates Charter rights” (G, at para. 117; see also paras. 133, 139 and 156). Declaring s. 490.012 to be of no force or effect immediately would effectively preclude courts from imposing SOIRA orders on any offenders, including those at high risk of recidivism. Granting an immediate declaration could therefore endanger the public interest in preventing and investigating sexual offences committed by high-risk offenders, undermining public safety. Balanced against this consideration is the significance of the rights violation that the suspension would temporarily prolong. Granting a suspension also runs counter to the public’s interest in legislation that complies with the Constitution. On balance, however, the circumstances justify a suspension of the declaration of invalidity for 12 months.

[140]                     A declaration of invalidity is presumed to operate retroactively (R. v. Albashir, 2021 SCC 48, at paras. 34 and 38). However, in this case, a retroactive application of the declaration at the conclusion of the suspension could frustrate the compelling public interests that require a period of transition, creating uncertainty and removing the protection that justifies the suspension in the first place (paras. 46, 52 and 72). Specifically, a retroactive declaration would undermine the purpose of the suspension (i.e., ensuring high-risk offenders are registered on SOIRA for public safety). Moreover, a prospective declaration of invalidity would not unduly prejudice offenders who have been registered since 2011 but whose rights under s. 7 are still violated. Those offenders will be able to ask for a personal remedy pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter in order to be removed from the registry if they can demonstrate that SOIRA’s impacts on their liberty bears no relation or is grossly disproportionate to the objective of s. 490.012.

[141]                     Finally, we would grant Mr. Ndhlovu a remedy under s. 24(1) and exempt him from the suspension of the declaration. It is generally desirable that a claimant who brings a successful constitutional challenge benefit from their efforts in litigating the issue (G, at paras. 148 and 182). Further, the Crown only adduced expert evidence on recidivism risk at the s. 1 hearing, after the sentencing judge had made a determination that Mr. Ndhlovu was at little risk to reoffend. While the Crown’s expert, Dr. Hanson, opined someone with some of the same characteristics as Mr. Ndhlovu would have an enhanced risk of reoffending, one that was about average for sex offenders, he indicated risk assessment is an individualized exercise involving many variables. That is precisely what the sentencing judge did in this case in finding that Mr. Ndhlovu was unlikely to reoffend. Moen J. found that he “will be safe to release into the community. I have absolutely no concerns that [he] will re-offend. Nor does the Crown suggest that [he] will.” Nor does the Crown argue on appeal that the sentencing judge made a palpable and overriding error in making this finding of fact. Based on this finding, there is no connection between subjecting Mr. Ndhlovu to a SOIRA order and the objective of capturing information about offenders that may assist police prevent and investigate sex offences.

B.            Section 490.013(2.1)

[142]                     With respect to lifetime registration, the Crown conceded a suspension would not be appropriate. We agree: an immediate declaration is appropriate given those offenders will remain registered and there is no “gap” for Parliament to fill. As a result, the existing provisions that dictate a length of registration will operate, pending any new constitutional provision that would target offenders who commit more than one offence. For instance, those convicted of offences with a maximum term of imprisonment of 2 to 5 years will receive a 10-year registration order, while those convicted of an offence with a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 to 14 years would receive a 20-year registration order (s. 490.013(2)). Here, there is no compelling reason to rebut the presumption of retroactive application of the declaration of invalidity. Section 490.013(2.1) is therefore declared invalid. Because the declaration affects all those impacted by the enactment of the provision since 2011, offenders who are subject to a lifetime order pursuant to this provision after having been convicted of more than one sexual offence without an intervening conviction can seek a s. 24(1) remedy to change the length of their registration.

VI.         Conclusion

[143]                     We would allow the appeal. The judgment of the Court of Appeal of Alberta is set aside. Sections 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) of the Criminal Code infringe s. 7 of the Charter, and the Crown has not demonstrated the infringement is justified under s. 1. The provisions are therefore declared of no force or effect under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. The declaration in respect of s. 490.012 is suspended for one year and applies prospectively. Mr. Ndhlovu is exempted from the suspension of the declaration. An immediate declaration is granted for s. 490.013(2.1) and applies retroactively.

                    Brown J. —

I.               Introduction

[144]                     I agree with the majority that mandatory lifetime registration in s. 490.013(2.1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, is overbroad. The Court of Appeal erred in saying there was no evidence to displace the “common sense inference” that individuals convicted of multiple offences at one time pose a greater risk of reoffending than those convicted of a single offence. The expert evidence was clear and uncontested: they do not. It therefore cannot reasonably be said that mandatory lifetime registration accords with the principles of fundamental justice. Nor can this be justified under s. 1 of the Charter, since Parliament could have crafted a narrower regime that distinguishes multiple sequential offences from prior convictions.

[145]                     I depart from the majority, however, on the constitutionality of s. 490.012. In finding it unconstitutional, my colleagues fixate on the removal of judicial discretion to exempt offenders who do not pose an “increased risk” to reoffend. But the exercise of discretion was the very problem that prompted Parliament to amend the Criminal Code to provide for automatic registration of sex offenders under the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, S.C. 2004, c. 10 (“SOIRA”). Specifically, many judges had exercised their discretion to exempt offenders in a manifestly improper manner, and the Registry’s low inclusion rate undermined its efficacy. The evidence is clear that even low risk sex offenders, relative to the general criminal population, pose a heightened risk to commit another sexual offence. It is also clear that it cannot be reliably predicted at the time of sentencing which offenders will reoffend. In the face of that uncertain risk, Parliament was entitled to cast a wide net.

II.            Background

[146]                     While the majority has summarized the background to this matter, I would stress a few points.

[147]                     The appellant pled guilty to sexual offences committed against two complainants, R.D. and C.B., at a party hosted by R.D. A pre‑sentence report led the sentencing judge to find he was a low risk to reoffend, that he would “be safe to release into the community”, and that she had “absolutely no concerns that [he] will re-offend” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 38). She sentenced the appellant to six months’ imprisonment followed by three years’ probation.

[148]                     The sentencing judge granted the mandatory DNA order, but adjourned the imposition of a SOIRA order, instead expressly inviting counsel to challenge the constitutional validity of the amended provisions. She also volunteered her own view that it is “completely disproportionate in circumstances of a case like this to -- to put someone on a sex offender registry for the balance of their life” (p. 49). After seeking instructions, defence counsel confirmed that she would seek an adjournment to bring a constitutional challenge. The sentencing judge allowed the adjournment and explained why she had raised it: “. . . I consider this to be much harsher than any term imprisonment. So I thought it was time” (p. 50).

[149]                     After the hearing, the sentencing judge, unsurprisingly given her earlier statement, declared the provisions to be overbroad and grossly disproportionate to the extent they remove judicial discretion to refuse to register offenders who present no risk of reoffending (2016 ABQB 595, 44 Alta. L.R. (6th) 382 (“ABQB reasons (2016)”)). She was not satisfied that including people like the appellant on the Registry would help police prevent and investigate sexual crimes. Subjecting all offenders, regardless of their future risk, to onerous reporting requirements, random compliance checks, and internal stigma goes further than is necessary to accomplish the goal of protecting the public. She further held that the limits on s. 7 could not be saved under s. 1 (2018 ABQB 277, 68 Alta. L.R. (6th) 89).

[150]                     A majority at the Court of Appeal of Alberta overturned her ruling (2020 ABCA 307, 12 Alta. L.R. (7th) 225). As to overbreadth, the sentencing judge defined the purpose of the legislation too narrowly. Sections 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) must be assessed in light of SOIRA’s broader purpose: to protect society from recidivist sexual offenders. Low risk does not equate to no risk. According to the majority, the commission of a sex offence is a reasonable proxy for the risk of recidivism and the appellant is an offender who, by virtue of being convicted of more than one offence, poses enhanced risk. In dissent, Khullar J.A. held that ss. 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) limit the appellant’s privacy and liberty rights under s. 7. The appellant was unlikely to reoffend and the provisions requiring him to register for life overreach in their effect. She concluded that the Crown failed to justify the limits as minimally impairing and proportionate.

III.         Analysis

A.           Overview of Section 7 Analysis

[151]                     The appellant says the removal of discretion deprives offenders of liberty in a manner that is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. He raises three such principles: arbitrariness, overbreadth, and gross disproportionality. All three are concerned with “failures of instrumental rationality” (Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, 2013 SCC 72, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1101, at para. 107, quoting H. Stewart, Fundamental Justice: Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (2012), at p. 151). First, arbitrariness describes the absence of a rational connection between the law’s purpose and the impugned effect on the individual, or where “it can be shown that the impugned effect undermines the objective of the law” (R. v. Michaud, 2015 ONCA 585, 127 O.R. (3d) 81, at para. 69, citing Bedford, at para. 111). Next, a law will be overbroad where it captures “some conduct” unrelated to its purpose, recognizing that a law can be rational in some cases but overreach in others (Bedford, at paras. 112 and 117 (emphasis deleted)). Finally, gross disproportionality will be found where “the law’s effects on life, liberty or security of the person are so grossly disproportionate to its purposes that they cannot rationally be supported” (Michaud, at para. 71, quoting Bedford, at para. 120). As I explain below, s. 490.012 accords with all these principles.

[152]                     The s. 7 analysis proceeds in four stages. First, I consider the purpose of s. 490.012(1), which is to help police prevent and investigate sexual crimes by requiring the registration of certain information relating to sex offenders. Next, I address why automatic registration is neither arbitrary nor grossly disproportionate in light of that objective. In the final section, I turn to overbreadth. As I will explain, automatic registration does not go further than necessary to achieve its purpose, because all sex offenders pose a higher risk to reoffend and the risk of recidivism cannot be reliably predicted at the time of sentencing. The sentencing judge erred in concluding otherwise, and my colleagues in the majority perpetuate this error.

B.            Identifying the Purpose of Section 490.012

[153]                     Section 490.012 contains no explicit statement of the purpose of automatic registration. The broader legislative scheme offers some clues, though. Section 2(1) of SOIRA states that “[t]he purpose of this Act is to help police services prevent and investigate crimes of a sexual nature by requiring the registration of certain information relating to sex offenders.” The guiding principles of the legislation include: (a) police having rapid access to certain information relating to sex offenders; (b) ensuring such information is current and reliable by collecting it on an ongoing basis; and (c) protecting the privacy and rehabilitation interests of sex offenders by requiring that the information be collected only to enable police services to prevent or investigate crimes of a sexual nature and restricting access to the information (s. 2(2)).

[154]                     Extrinsic evidence reveals that Parliament amended the statutory scheme in response to concerns that the Registry’s efficacy was compromised by the exclusion of nearly half of all convicted sex offenders. Parliament’s reason for creating the Registry and the data on the number of offenders being registered themselves substantiate these concerns.

[155]                     The creation of sex offender registries in Canada was prompted by a growing public concern about “protecting children and other vulnerable victims from sex offenders through a system of careful monitoring of convicted sex offenders” (R. v. Long, 2018 ONCA 282, 45 C.R. (7th) 98, at para. 86). That concern was exemplified by the enactment of Ontario’s registry in 2001, which applied automatically to everyone in the province who was convicted of, or was already serving a sentence for, a listed sexual offence (Christopher’s Law (Sex Offender Registry), 2000, S.O. 2000, c. 1, s. 2). The national Registry soon followed in 2004.

[156]                     But after several years, lawmakers queried whether the Registry was fulfilling its purposes. The government struck a standing committee in 2009 to review SOIRA. The committee gathered evidence and recommended specific amendments “to help police departments prevent crimes of a sexual nature, solve them more quickly, and more effectively supervise sex offenders in the community” (House of Commons, Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, Statutory Review of the Sex Offender Information Registry Act: Report of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, 2nd Sess., 40th Parl., December 2009, at p. 2).

[157]                     When the committee compared the two registries, it found a significant divergence in the inclusion rate: Ontario’s registry included the names of 96.84% of sex offenders, while only approximately 50% of offenders were included on the national Registry (House of Commons, Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, Evidence, No. 15, 2nd Sess., 40th Parl., April 21, 2009, at p. 4; Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, December 2009, at p. 8). And while the Ontario registry was consulted 475 times per day, the national Registry was only consulted an average of 165 times per year (Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, December 2009, at p. 5). Accordingly, the committee recommended, among other things, that registration should be automatic for offenders found guilty of a designated sexual offence, as is the case in Ontario, except in rare circumstances where the impact on the offender would be grossly disproportionate to the public interest.

[158]                     The government provided a written response, explaining that it would adopt most of the committee’s recommendations by asking Parliament to enact the Protecting Victims From Sex Offenders Act, S.C. 2010, c. 17. With respect to automatic registration, the government agreed that the current model “presented concerns as some convicted sex offenders have not been included on the Registry in cases where the Crown Prosecutor has not made an application or judges have concluded that the offender met the ‘grossly disproportionate’ test” (Government Response to the Fifth Report of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security Entitled Statutory Review of the Sex Offender Information Registry Act, April 12, 2010 (online)). The amendments responded to those concerns by creating “a fully automatic inclusion model”, to make the Registry “as effective as possible when police are investigating crimes of a sexual nature” (Government Response).

[159]                     The same themes emerge from the legislative committees and debates. During second reading of Bill C-34, Protecting Victims From Sex Offenders Act, 2nd Sess., 40th Parl., 2009, the Minister of Public Safety emphasized that mandatory inclusion would eliminate the “flaw” in the current legislation that allows convicted sex offenders to avoid being added to the Registry, “which hampers future police investigations and exposes Canadians to greater risk” (House of Commons Debates, vol. 144, No. 67, 2nd Sess., 40th Parl., June 3, 2009, at p. 4148). Put another way, the amendment aimed to remove a “loophole” that meant the police had “no access to information on some convicted sex offenders during the investigation of a crime, either because a crown attorney has not sought an order for them to register or the presiding judge has declined to grant one” (House of Commons Debates, vol. 144, No. 70, 2nd Sess., 40th Parl., June 8, 2009, at p. 4324). As RCMP Inspector Nezan explained to the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, police were concerned about recidivists “falling through the cracks”:

The absence of an automatic inclusion on the registry of all offenders convicted of sexual crimes has led to the inconsistent application of the law across the country. Someone convicted of molesting a child in one province may be ordered to the registry, while in another province they may not. Given the difficulty of determining which sex offender will reoffend and which will not, this means that some of the recidivists are falling through the cracks. [Emphasis added.]

 

(April 21, 2009, at p. 3)

[160]                     In light of this evidence of legislative intent, the statements of purpose put forward by both the sentencing judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal should be rejected. The sentencing judge held that the purpose of SOIRA was “to protect vulnerable people including children in society, by allowing police quick access to current information on convicted sex offenders” (ABQB reasons (2016), at para. 87; see para. 85). Nothing in the legislative text or proceedings reveals such a narrow purpose. Public safety for vulnerable persons and children, though likely a desirable effect of the legislation, was not a cited purpose (SOIRA, s. 2(1)). The legislation was intended to increase safety for all, not just vulnerable persons (R. v. Redhead, 2006 ABCA 84, 384 A.R. 206, at paras. 37-38; R. v. T.A.S., 2018 SKQB 183, at para. 79 (CanLII); Long, at para. 89). For the majority at the Court of Appeal, the legislative purpose of s. 490.012 was broader: “. . . to require mandatory registration of all sex offenders convicted of designated offences” (para. 74). But that statement erroneously conflates the purpose of the law with the means for achieving the purpose. The Court of Appeal’s reasoning is circular: if mandatory registration is the purpose, then requiring mandatory registration will always be rationally connected to that purpose.

[161]                     The foregoing evidence supports Khullar J.A.’s understanding of the purpose of the automatic registration requirement imposed by s. 490.012(1) as conforming to the overall statutory objective: “. . . to help police services prevent and investigate crimes of a sexual nature by requiring the registration of certain information relating to sex offenders” (para. 198; SOIRA, s. 2(1)). This statement of purpose is sufficiently precise and succinct to frame the s. 7 analysis. It is similar to the majority’s statement of purpose, being “to capture information about offenders that may assist police prevent and investigate sex offences” (para. 73). I depart from the majority, however, in its conclusion that automatic registration of sex offenders is not rationally connected to the objective of helping police prevent and investigate sexual offences. As I explain below, it clearly is.

C.            Arbitrariness

[162]                     The sentencing judge did not find s. 490.012 to be arbitrary, saying it was “not the case that there is no connection between providing police with up-to-date information on previous sex offenders and the goal of investigating and preventing sexual crimes” (ABQB reasons (2016), at para. 92). The majority below agreed (para. 42).

[163]                     The appellant has not demonstrated any error in those conclusions. There is a clear connection between having accurate and up-to-date information about persons more likely to commit sexual offences and the investigation and prevention of sexual crimes. Mandatory registration of convicted sex offenders in SOIRA is not arbitrary.

D.           Gross Disproportionality

[164]                     The sentencing judge concluded that mandatory registration is grossly disproportionate. She found that the cumulative effects of registration were significant, taking into account not only the scope of the reporting requirements, but also the other deleterious effects on offenders, such as the impact of random compliance checks, the risk of information being divulged during those checks, and the potentially far-reaching effects on an offender’s privacy (ABQB reasons (2016), at para. 124). The majority, while not reaching a conclusion on gross disproportionality, observes that SOIRA conditions are “onerous and ongoing” (para. 9; see also paras. 45, 56, 83, 116 and 135).

[165]                     With respect, to describe SOIRA conditions as “onerous” strips that term of all meaning. The Court of Appeal for Ontario has characterized the effects of registration on liberty as “modest”, relative to the important state interest (R. v. Dyck, 2008 ONCA 309, 90 O.R. (3d) 409 (“Dyck (C.A.)”), at paras. 104, 106 and 109; Long, at para. 147). Applying Dyck and Long, the Court of Appeal in this case concluded the SOIRA requirements were, “if not strictly modest, reasonable and not dissimilar to many other reporting obligations that routinely occur as part of the everyday life of all Canadians, who are state-compelled to provide information from time to time” (para. 130). Moreover, these conditions that my colleagues find so “onerous” flow from the very fact that it is a registry. A registry is effective only when it has complete and up-to-date information; absent those conditions, there would be no point to even having it. My colleagues, I note, do not describe conditions of a registry that would be less “onerous” while still allowing it to be effective.

[166]                     I agree that the sentencing judge erred in characterizing the impact of registration. SOIRA conditions do not prevent offenders from going anywhere or doing anything (C.A. reasons, at para. 131, citing Dyck (C.A.), at paras. 106 and 111; R. v. Debidin, 2008 ONCA 868, 94 O.R. (3d) 421, at para. 82; transcript, at p. 145). The appellant raised concerns that the information might be leaked, but these concerns are entirely speculative. Access to the Registry is strictly controlled. The reporting is confidential and use of the information is strictly limited to police for the prevention and investigation of sexual offences (Dyck (C.A.), at para. 119; R. v. Cross, 2006 NSCA 30, 241 N.S.R. (2d) 349, at para. 84(6.)). While the appellant also testified to the “stigma” he experiences from being constantly labelled a sex offender, any stigma flows from the convictions themselves, not registration (C.A. reasons, at paras. 135‑37, citing R. v. C. (S.S.), 2008 BCCA 262, 234 C.C.C. (3d) 365, at paras. 47-48; Dyck (C.A.), at para. 118; Cross, at para. 55). Further, as Khullar J.A. observed, “[a]nxiety caused by a law is not usually considered an infringement of liberty” (para. 224) and the sentencing judge did not make a finding that the appellant’s concerns deprived him of his security of the person (paras. 225-26).

[167]                     Not only does my conclusion align with appellate jurisprudence, but it also avoids the serious doctrinal difficulties posed by the majority’s reasons. If the majority is correct that SOIRA orders have a “serious” and “considerable” impact on an offender’s liberty (see paras. 7, 45, 54, 57 and 135), the test for punishment as set out in R. v. K.R.J., 2016 SCC 31, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 906, at para. 41, per Karakatsanis J., would likely be met. And yet, this would be inconsistent with appellate jurisprudence consistently holding that sex offender registry requirements do not amount to punishment (see Cross; Dyck (C.A.); R. v. Hooyer, 2016 ONCA 44, 129 O.R. (3d) 81, at para. 45).

[168]                     Further, the majority’s conclusion would likely engage s. 11(i) of the Charter, such that no one convicted of a sexual offence prior to 2004 could be required to register on the SOIRA registry, and that Parliament could not enact a new SOIRA law that expressly applies retroactively. Equally alarming are the long-term implications of the majority’s conclusion. Unlike other types of punishment, SOIRA requirements do not significantly limit lawful activities in which the accused can engage, where the accused can go, or with whom an accused can communicate or associate. The “most obvious impact on liberty”, according to the majority, is the risk of imprisonment for failure to meet the reporting requirements without “reasonable excuse” (para. 54). On that logic, other measures that appellate courts have previously concluded were not punishment may now constitute punishment. While my majoritarian colleagues “make no finding as to whether SOIRA orders constitute punishment under the K.R.J. test” (para. 58), that is entirely beside the point. The point is that it is implicit in their analysis that these orders likely constitute punishment. This is no mere theoretical concern. It is hardly unprecedented, after all, for a court to expressly decline to decide an issue while, at the same time, effectively deciding it by adopting a particular line of reasoning (see, e.g., and taken together, R. v. Moriarity, 2015 SCC 55, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 485, at para. 30; R. v. Stillman, 2019 SCC 40, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 144, at paras. 97-109 and 113).

[169]                     Further, and even where the impacts on an offender’s liberty and privacy interests are more than modest, those impacts must be considered in context. An offender who is placed on the Registry has already been tried and convicted of a designated sexual offence (Long, at para. 147). Until now, a SOIRA order has not been characterized as a sentence or a punishment, but a consequence of conviction (Redhead, at para. 12). A person convicted of a serious crime should expect a significant loss of personal privacy (R. v. F. (P.R.) (2001), 2001 CanLII 21168 (ON CA), 57 O.R. (3d) 475 (C.A.), at para. 18, per Rosenberg J.A.; R. v. Beare, 1988 CanLII 126 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 387, at p. 413). And the impacts must be measured against the inherent severity of the offending conduct (C.A. reasons, at paras. 79-81 and 232). The duration of a SOIRA order is directly connected to the maximum term of imprisonment for that sexual offence (s. 490.013(2)). By linking the length of time for reporting to the severity of the offence, Parliament built proportionality into the legislative scheme (I.F., Attorney General of Nova Scotia, at para. 64).

[170]                     Another consideration militating against the appellant’s arguments on gross disproportionality is the availability of a termination order. The regime permits offenders to apply to terminate SOIRA orders after (a) 5 years, if they are subject to an order for 10 years; (b) 10 years if they are subject to a 20-year order; and (c) 20 years if they are subject to a lifetime order (s. 490.015(1)). The termination provision allows judges to assess the impacts of SOIRA at a later date when the offender can demonstrate they have been in the community without reoffending, rather than making “speculative predictions of future dangerousness” based on the limited evidence available at sentencing (J. Benedet, “A Victim-Centred Evaluation of the Federal Sex Offender Registry” (2012), 37 Queen’s L.J. 437, at p. 468). Termination orders are undoubtedly rare, since an offender must meet the “high standard” of showing the impact on the offender’s privacy or liberty is “grossly disproportionate to the public interest” (s. 490.016(1); Redhead, at para. 43). But if there is truly a disproportionate impact, a termination order will be available (R. v. Dyck (2005), 2005 CanLII 47771 (ON SC), 203 C.C.C. (3d) 365 (Ont. S.C.J.), at para. 125).

[171]                     Finally, the sentencing judge failed to consider the impacts of SOIRA in light of its aim: to investigate and prevent sexual offences. As Khullar J.A. held, “[t]his is not the kind of case where the objective is simply not important enough to warrant the level of infringement of liberty that it imposes” (para. 232). SOIRA imposes a burden on offenders, but that burden is not “totally out of sync” with the objectives (Bedford, at para. 120). I agree with the Attorney General of Nova Scotia that characterizing reporting obligations as “grossly disproportionate” in this context risks trivializing that term (I.F., at para. 61).

E.            Overbreadth

[172]                     A law is overbroad, the Court explained in R. v. Safarzadeh-Markhali, 2016 SCC 14, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 180, if it goes “further than reasonably necessary to achieve its legislative goals” (para. 50). There is a heavy onus on the party alleging that legislation is overbroad:

     As noted above, the root question is whether the law is inherently bad because there is no connection, in whole or in part, between its effects and its purpose. This standard is not easily met. The evidence may, as in Morgentaler, show that the effect actually undermines the objective and is therefore “inconsistent” with the objective. Or the evidence may, as in Chaoulli, show that there is simply no connection on the facts between the effect and the objective, and the effect is therefore “unnecessary”. Regardless of how the judge describes this lack of connection, the ultimate question remains whether the evidence establishes that the law violates basic norms because there is no connection between its effect and its purpose. This is a matter to be determined on a case-by-case basis, in light of the evidence. [Underlining added.]

 

(Bedford, at para. 119, per McLachlin C.J.)

[173]                     Having identified the purpose of s. 490.012(1), the question here is whether automatic registration of all offenders goes further than reasonably necessary to achieve the objective of helping police prevent and investigate sexual crimes by requiring the registration of certain information. The sentencing judge acknowledged there was a statistical probability that a sex offender will reoffend, but concluded the law was overbroad because it captured individuals who have little or no chance of reoffending (ABQB reasons (2016), at para. 119). The Crown does not dispute that the Registry may impose obligations on offenders who never end up reoffending, but emphasizes that all convicted sex offenders pose a higher risk and it is impossible to say at the time of sentencing that a particular offender poses no risk of reoffending.

[174]                     The Crown’s argument is supported by the expert evidence. Offenders convicted of a sexual offence are five to eight times more likely to reoffend than those convicted of a non-sexual offence. Both experts agreed that the recidivism risk cannot be determined with certainty at the time of sentencing. Dr. Zgoba explained that a risk assessment cannot guarantee whether any individual will reoffend. Both experts also testified that observed recidivism rates underestimate the true rates of sexual reoffending. Professor Benedet makes a similar point, saying recidivism studies do not typically measure whether offenders commit further offences (or have already committed other offences in the past) for which they were never apprehended or charged (“Long and Ndhlovu: The Federal Sex offender Registry and Section 7 of the Charter” (2018), 45 C.R. (7th) 132; see also Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, April 21, 2009, at p. 9).

[175]                     The Crown’s argument is also supported by logic and experience. Assessing future risk is “inherently imprecise” (Long, at para. 125). The Court of Appeal for Ontario has confirmed that, as a group, sex offenders will always pose “a greater risk than the rest of the population for engaging in that activity” and, thus, a prior conviction for a sex offence is “a reliable indication of risk and a proper method of assessing that risk” (Dyck (C.A.), at para. 100). More recently, the court in R. v. B.P.M., 2019 BCPC 156, dismissed a similar overbreadth argument. It concluded that all sex offenders should be registered because, “as a matter of common sense and experience, individuals who are convicted of sex crimes have an increased propensity to commit sex crimes in the future” (para. 48 (CanLII), quoting Long, at para. 119). Inspector Nezan explained in his Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security testimony that predicting recidivism is “very difficult” and that, from a police perspective, it is “dangerous” to use a risk-based assessment to determine which offenders should be registered (April 21, 2009, at p. 8).

[176]                     The majority ignores this evidence, instead hinging its analysis on two premises: (1) that certain offenders do not pose an “increased risk” of reoffending; and (2) that registering such offenders bears no connection to the purpose. Indeed, the phrase “increased risk” is repeated 20 times in the majority’s reasons (see paras. 7‑8, 10‑11, 79, 82‑83, 85, 87, 89‑90, 92, 100‑101, 111, 121 and 138). 

[177]                     My colleagues do not explain their basis for rejecting the expert evidence that an offender’s risk cannot be determined with certainty at the time of sentencing. They accept that “the commission of a sexual offence is one of many empirically validated predictors of increased sexual recidivism” (para. 94). In the same breath, however, they assert that, “[i]n certain cases, an offender’s personal circumstances mean they are not at an increased risk of reoffending, undermining any real possibility that their information on the registry will ever prove useful to police” (para. 85). My colleagues boldly promenade where experts fear to tread, leaning on the term “increased” to avoid particularizing what they rely on to characterize this risk as such. In support, they claim to cite multiple “examples” (para. 90) of offenders whose likelihood of reoffending is “highly improbable” (para. 89). But in substance they cherry pick just one such example: an exceptional case involving an offender who was wheelchair bound. That my colleagues can point to only a single, extreme case where it was clear at the time of sentencing that the offender did not pose an “increased risk” tends to prove my point, not theirs.

[178]                     The majority’s analysis suffers from a further flaw. My colleagues assert that uncertainty in predicting the risk of reoffending is irrelevant in overbreadth, since enforcement practicality can only be considered under s. 1. They rely on Carter v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 5, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 331, Bedford and Safarzadeh‑Markhali, where this Court held that difficulties in defining the scope of the law to adequately serve the legislative purpose are not relevant in overbreadth (majority reasons, at paras. 103‑7).

[179]                     But unlike those instances, here Parliament did not struggle to define the scope of the law. In enacting s. 490.012, Parliament deliberately chose not to distinguish between more serious and less serious sexual offences or higher risk and lower risk offenders. Instead, Parliament required registration for all sex offenders based on a shared characteristic: a heightened risk of committing a future sexual offence. The government can enact legislation that treats all individuals with a common characteristic in the same manner, without offending s. 7, provided there is a rational connection between that characteristic and the government’s purpose. And here, there is a “logical link” between automatic registration on the basis of a sex conviction and the purpose of s. 490.012. On the information available at the time of sentencing, every person convicted of a designated offence poses a heightened risk of committing another sexual offence as compared to persons convicted of non-sexual offences.

[180]                     The enhanced risk may be marginal in some cases, but “Parliament is not required to precisely calibrate recidivism risk” (C.A. reasons, at para. 89). Nor is “[p]erfect symmetry between the social science measuring rates of recidivism and the reach of the registry” required (C. (P.S.) v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 2007 BCSC 895, 222 C.C.C. (3d) 230, at para. 118; see also R. v. Sharpe, 2001 SCC 2, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45, at para. 89). Parliament is entitled to act on reasoned apprehension of harm even if on some points “the jury is still out” (R. v. Malmo-Levine, 2003 SCC 74, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 571, at para. 78). As the majority at the Court of Appeal explained, any exclusion of convicted sex offenders based on perceived seriousness of an offence or likelihood of recidivism necessarily results in the police not having information on some offenders who do, in fact, reoffend (para. 93).

[181]                     It was within Parliament’s purview to draw a line based on that known increased risk of unknown degree, rather than leaving it to prosecutors and judges to weigh if an offender poses an “increased risk” in each case. Once it is demonstrated that the harm sought to be avoided is more than trivial, “the precise weighing and calculation of the nature and extent of the harm is Parliament’s job” (Malmo-Levine, at para. 133). After that threshold is reached, the legislature is “entitled to make policy choices within a reasonable range of options” (Dyck (C.A.), at para. 124). A small risk of serious harm is sufficient.

[182]                     My colleagues overlook another important reason that Parliament drew that line: to fix a flaw in the Registry that allowed judges to exempt offenders who they deemed not to be “predators”, contrary to the legislative intent. Professor Benedet observes that, prior to the amendments, some judges granted exemptions based not on the impact of registration on the offender (as required by the statutory provision) but on whether the offender was the type of person for whom the Registry was intended — in other words, a “real” sex offender (Benedet (2012); transcript, at p. 85). The category of “real” sex offender has been, at times, defined so narrowly as to exclude offenders who sexually assaulted people they knew, child pornography users, opportunistic offenders, and historic offenders. A few examples are telling.

[183]                     Beginning with R. v. Have, 2005 ONCJ 27, 194 C.C.C. (3d) 151, a line of decisions found that the aim of the Registry was to assist police in the investigation of crimes by “predatory strangers” and offenders who do not fit this model should be exempted. In Have, the offender pled guilty to two counts of possession of child pornography after police seized a large quantity of files from his computer. Duncan J. characterized the circumstances as “exceptional”, because possession of child pornography is one of the few sexual offences that does not directly harm a victim and the accused had established that he had no propensity to act on his sexual interests. According to Duncan J., the “fundamental assumption” that the accused, because of his past conduct, had a propensity to commit a sexual crime in the future was “considerably weaker” than in most cases. The value of registration in those circumstances was “negligible”, the impact on the accused was “substantial”, and the balance, in his view, was grossly disproportionate.

[184]                     Following Have, Caldwell J. in R. v. Burke, 2005 ONCJ 422, found that the impact of SOIRA registration on the accused was grossly disproportionate and declined to make an order. Mr. Burke was convicted of sexual assault after trial. The judge found that he grabbed the complainant, got on top of her, and began kissing her, touching her breasts, and touching her under her shorts in the area of her vagina (paras. 2 and 4 (CanLII)). At sentencing, he did not present any evidence of his risk of reoffending, but the judge inferred it was low based on his lack of criminal history (paras. 59 and 63). Caldwell J. found it “extremely significant that [SOIRA] obligations are on-going for a minimum of ten years and that the individual is potentially subject to conviction, fine and/or imprisonment if they provide inaccurate information” (para. 17). Mr. Burke’s offence was “on the lower end of the spectrum” (para. 58), and therefore, the public interest in his registration was “substantially lower than the interest in registering the type of offender upon whom the registry was modelled” (para. 64).

[185]                     Notably, both judges found that registration was a significant intrusion for offenders who were not predatory strangers and remarked that an overly inclusive registry could be counter-productive because it could dilute police resources (Have, at p. 157; Burke, at para. 39). Those propositions have been discredited by appellate courts. The Court of Appeal of Alberta in Redhead rejected the conclusion from Have that the Registry’s purpose was limited to investigating predatory offenders with a propensity to commit similar offences in the future. Specifically, it addressed the argument that the accused was not the type of offender covered by SOIRA because he did not have a criminal history of the same nature, the offence was less serious, and the risk of reoffending was low. The court held:

     We do not agree. The language of s. 490.012 does not suggest its application is so limited. Rather, the absence of such limiting language reflects Parliament’s recognition of predictable repetitive behaviour of sexual offenders, and the inordinate consequences of sexual offences for victims of any age. [para. 38]

[186]                     The British Columbia Court of Appeal followed Redhead in R. v. Y. (B.T.), 2006 BCCA 331, 210 C.C.C. (3d) 484, overturning a decision granting an exemption to an offender who had sexually abused his daughter over a six-year period. The trial judge found that he was not a “predatory stranger” and thus not caught within the purpose of the legislation. Rowles J.A. wrote that, by focusing the purpose of SOIRA on a particular class of offender, the trial judge “created a classification scheme that Parliament did not enact” (para. 39). The Court of Appeal for Ontario also rejected the predatory stranger model in Debidin, observing that SOIRA “does not distinguish between the predatory stranger and the opportunistic friend, relative or custodian” (para. 77).

[187]                     Yet, judges did not only exempt offenders deemed to be non-predatory or unlikely to reoffend. Even violent offenders who were likely recidivists have been exempted from SOIRA. In R. v. B.S.S., 2006 BCPC 135, the accused pled guilty to sexual assault and assault against his wife. He had a serious drinking problem and had a history of violence. On the day of the first offence, he raped his wife. He was assessed as posing a high risk of future violence against her. Nevertheless, Baird Ellan Prov. Ct. J. exempted the accused from registration, following Have and Burke which held that the purpose of the Registry was to deal with predatory offenders and it was not “designed to address this kind of offence” (para. 82 (CanLII)), whatever that means.

[188]                     Judges have granted exemptions even where the victim was a stranger and the offences were highly predatory. In R. v. Worm, 2005 ABPC 92, the accused pled guilty to sexual assault and assault with a weapon. He grabbed the complainant’s buttocks as she was jogging and threatened bystanders with a knife before running away. He was assessed at a low to moderate risk of recidivism, with the risk increasing significantly during periods of intoxication. Though the offender was a drunk predatory stranger armed with a weapon, the sentencing judge nevertheless found that the impact of registration would be grossly disproportionate “having regard to the circumstances and severity of the offence” (para. 53 (CanLII)).

[189]                     Perhaps most concerning is R. v. Randall, 2006 NSPC 38, 247 N.S.R. (2d) 205, where the accused was convicted of internet luring after inviting an undercover police officer, believed to be a 13-year-old girl, to meet him for sexual activity. He insisted on meeting for sex, rejecting her suggestion that they go shopping instead. The accused arrived with packets of condoms and was arrested. The sentencing judge found that the accused was in denial about his behaviour, but still granted an exemption because he was assessed at a low risk of reoffending, “his conduct was not predatory” but rather “poor judgment”, he was not considered a “hunter,” and he had no prior sexual offences (para. 16). The judge was also concerned that registration would severely affect the accused because he would “carry a stigma” and his privacy would be impacted (para. 15). It is difficult to imagine a more predatory activity than online child luring (Benedet (2012), at p. 455) — yet that was not enough for the offender to be caught by SOIRA.

[190]                     And finally, exemptions have been granted to offenders who occupied positions of trust and abused vulnerable victims. In R. v. Aldea, 2005 SKQB 461, 271 Sask. R. 272, a priest prostituted underage girls in the church rectory and took pornographic photographs of each of them. The court held that an exemption was justified, “having regard to the nature of his vocation, his current living circumstances”, and his low risk to reoffend (para. 40). In R. v. S. (M.W.), 2007 BCSC 1188, 52 C.R. (6th) 77, a doctor was convicted of sexually assaulting female patients under the guise of medical examinations over a 20-year period, including having sexual intercourse with one patient. Though the offender had little insight into his crimes and insisted the assaults were “misunderstandings” on the part of the victims, the psychologists assessed him as a low risk to reoffend because he was no longer practicing medicine (paras. 17 and 67). Bruce J. granted an exemption, noting that the public interest served by registration was “minimal to non-existent” (para. 72), SOIRA’s impact on him would be “substantial” (para. 74), and he was “not the type of person Parliament had in mind when it created the SOIRA registry” (para. 76).

[191]                     Those cases ⸺ and many others decided prior to the amendments in 2011 ⸺ demonstrate that judges too often found “reasons” to exempt offenders who committed offences they viewed as less serious, who had no prior history of sexual offending, or who did not appear to pose a high risk (or, to use the majority’s phrase, an “increased risk”) to strangers. They also “provide a window into judicial thinking about the relative seriousness of types of sexual offending, and show that the exercise of judicial discretion in the area of sexual assault is fraught with the persistence of problematic assumptions about what a ‘real’ sex offender looks like” (Benedet (2012), at p. 440).

[192]                     As if to remove all doubt on this point, similar assumptions about what a “real” sex offender looks like were also relied upon by the sentencing judge in this case. She found that “low risk” offenders, such as the appellant, fall in the category of offenders who should not be captured by SOIRA, and therefore the law is overbroad. But this reasoning is flawed for two reasons. First, it ignores that “the purpose of the regime is not limited to tracking predators” and the appellant nonetheless poses a heightened risk of reoffending (T.A.S., at para. 79; see Long, at para. 89). Secondly, it assumes that offenders who commit “minor” sex crimes are less likely to reoffend. There is no evidence supporting this assumption. Both experts testified that the seriousness of a sexual offence is a poor predictor of recidivism on its own. The Registry aims to help police prevent and investigate all sexual crimes. Under s. 7, the court’s task is not to assess the law’s efficacy but simply to compare the objective with its effects (Bedford, at para. 123). Here, the objective (preventing and investigating sexual offences) is clearly furthered by its effect (registering all sex offenders) because we do not know who will reoffend, but we know that many will, with serious effects.

[193]                     On that point, I would endorse the comments of the Court of Appeal that digital penetration of a sleeping victim is never “minor” or “de minimis” conduct (paras. 77-84). All forms of sexual violence are morally blameworthy, precisely because they involve wrongful exploitation and denial of the victim’s dignity as a human being (R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, at para. 89, citing R. v. Mabior, 2012 SCC 47, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 584, at paras. 45 and 48). This Court has recently described the serious harms that flow from sexual offences, particularly against children, which “are notorious for their devastating impact, often ruining the lives of their victims, and of those whose lives intersect with those victims as they move into adulthood” (K.R.J., at para. 131). Sentencing judges must “properly understand the wrongfulness of sexual offences” and “the profound harm that they cause” (Friesen, at para. 50).

[194]                     Given what appears to have been a persistent, routine failure to appreciate the seriousness of these offences, it can be confidently predicted that the rampant misuse of judicial discretion prior to the amendments will recur once automatic registration is removed. There is a remarkable consistency of views between the judgment in Have, which viewed the possession of child pornography as essentially a victimless crime, and the sentencing judge’s reasons in this case, which refused to characterize the penetration of a sleeping woman as a major sexual assault. Indeed, and as Schutz J.A. wrote, the sentencing judge’s own conclusions prove Parliament’s point in making all orders mandatory: “. . . different judges may make different assessments about the seriousness of criminal conduct and an offender’s risk to reoffend” (C.A. reasons, at para. 79). This explains Parliament’s decision to remove judicial discretion to include all offenders convicted of a designated offence.

[195]                     Parliament sought to avoid those chronic and improper exercises of judicial discretion by drawing a clear line: all sexual offences are serious and all sex offenders pose a heightened risk. Both premises are backed by expert evidence, judicial precedents, and logic. The majority’s reasons suggest that judicial discretion cannot be fettered. But following the majority’s analysis to its inevitable conclusion, Parliament could never remove judicial discretion from a criminal law scheme. And yet, is that not what all legislation does to some extent? This Court’s role is limited to examining legislation for Charter compliance, not second-guessing policy decisions. Operating within that confine, I am constrained to conclude that s. 490.012 is appropriately tailored to its purpose of helping the police prevent and investigate sexual crimes, and does not limit an offender’s s. 7 rights in a manner that bears no connection to its objective.

IV.         Conclusion

[196]                     I would allow the appeal in part. Section 490.012 is constitutional.

                  Brown and Rowe JJ. —

I.               Introduction

[1]                             Conditional sentences are a form of punishment that allow offenders to serve their sentences in the community, rather than in jail. Parliament created the conditional sentencing regime in 1996. In 2012, it amended the regime to make conditional sentences unavailable for certain serious offences and categories of serious offences. This appeal addresses the constitutionality of certain of those amendments.

[2]                             In 2015, Ms. Sharma brought into Canada 1.97 kilograms of cocaine. She pleaded guilty to importing a Sch. I substance contrary to s. 6(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19 (“CDSA”), and sought a conditional sentence. However, the 2012 amendments to the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 made conditional sentences unavailable for offences with a maximum term of imprisonment of 14 years or life (s. 742.1(c)) and for offences, prosecuted by indictment, having a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years and involving the import, export, trafficking, or production of drugs (s. 742.1(e)(ii)). The sentencing judge held that a conditional sentence was unavailable, and dismissed Ms. Sharma’s challenges under ss. 7 and 15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Ms. Sharma appealed. A majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario held that the impugned provisions (ss. 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii)) were overbroad under s. 7, and that they discriminated against Indigenous offenders like Ms. Sharma under s. 15(1). The Crown appeals from the Court of Appeal’s decision.

[3]                             We would allow the appeal and restore the sentencing judge’s order. The impugned provisions do not limit Ms. Sharma’s s. 15(1) rights. While the crisis of Indigenous incarceration is undeniable, Ms. Sharma did not demonstrate that the impugned provisions created or contributed to a disproportionate impact on Indigenous offenders, relative to non‑Indigenous offenders, as she must show at the first step of the s. 15(1) analysis.

[4]                             Nor do the impugned provisions limit Ms. Sharma’s s. 7 rights. Their purpose is to enhance consistency in the conditional sentencing regime by making imprisonment the typical punishment for certain serious offences and categories of offences. And that is what they do. Maximum sentences are a reasonable proxy for the seriousness of an offence and, accordingly, the provisions do not deprive individuals of their liberty in circumstances that bear no connection to their objective.

II.            Facts

[5]                             In June 2015, Ms. Sharma, a woman of Ojibwa ancestry and a member of the Saugeen First Nation, arrived in Toronto on an international flight. Upon inspection, her suitcase was found to contain 1.97 kilograms of cocaine. She confessed that day to the RCMP that her partner had promised to pay her $20,000 to bring the suitcase to Canada. At the time, she was two months behind on rent and facing eviction. Ms. Sharma was 20 years old, with no prior criminal record.

[6]                             Ms. Sharma pleaded guilty to importing a Sch. I substance contrary to s. 6(1) of the CDSA. Her sentencing was contested, and the judge ordered a Gladue report. This report revealed a life of significant hardship and intergenerational trauma. She had become a single mother at 17, had few supports, and the prospect of homelessness for her child motivated her to agree to her partner’s request. The Gladue report noted that Ms. Sharma’s grandmother was a residential school survivor, that Ms. Sharma’s mother had spent time in foster care, and that Ms. Sharma had been sexually assaulted and had dropped out of school due to financial difficulties.

III.         Legislative Framework

[7]                             Conditional sentences are a type of incarceration provided for under s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code. Such sentences permit offenders who meet statutory criteria to serve their sentences under strict surveillance in their communities, rather than in jail.

[8]                             Parliament legislated conditional sentences in 1996 in the Act to amend the Criminal Code (sentencing) and other Acts in consequence thereof, S.C. 1995, c. 22. The Act significantly reformed sentencing law (R. v. Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, at para. 39), by including an express statement of the purposes and principles of sentencing, by providing for the conditional sentencing regime itself, and by enacting s. 718.2, which sets out considerations for judges to have regard to when determining a fit sentence. In particular, s. 718.2(e) provides that “all available sanctions, other than imprisonment, that are reasonable in the circumstances and consistent with the harm done to victims or to the community should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders”.

[9]                             Parliament’s principal objectives in enacting this legislation were to reduce sentences of imprisonment and to expand the use of restorative justice principles in sentencing (Gladue, at para. 48; R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, at para. 15). Section 718.2(e) and the conditional sentencing regime in s. 742.1 were aimed at achieving these goals (Proulx, at paras. 21, 90 and 127; Gladue, at para. 40; R. v. Wells, 2000 SCC 10, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 207, at para. 31).

[10]                        The Court first considered s. 742.1 in Proulx. Under the legislation at that time, offenders were not eligible for a conditional sentence if (1) their offence was punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment; (2) the court would impose a term of imprisonment of more than two years; (3) imposing a conditional sentence would endanger the safety of the community; or (4) imposing a conditional sentence would be inconsistent with the fundamental purposes and principles of sentencing.

[11]                        In 2007, Parliament amended s. 742.1 to provide that conditional sentences would also not be available to offenders convicted of a “serious personal injury offence” as defined in s. 752.01, or for offenders convicted of other specific crimes (An Act to amend the Criminal Code (conditional sentence of imprisonment), S.C. 2007, c. 12).

[12]                        Parliament again amended s. 742.1 in 2012 in the Safe Streets and Communities Act, S.C. 2012, c. 1, s. 34 (“SSCA”), resulting in the current version of s. 742.1. It reads as follows:

Imposing of conditional sentence

 

742.1 If a person is convicted of an offence and the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years, the court may, for the purpose of supervising the offender’s behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community, subject to the conditions imposed under section 742.3, if

 

(a) the court is satisfied that the service of the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2;

 

(b) the offence is not an offence punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment;

 

(c) the offence is not an offence, prosecuted by way of indictment, for which the maximum term of imprisonment is 14 years or life;

 

(d) the offence is not a terrorism offence, or a criminal organization offence, prosecuted by way of indictment, for which the maximum term of imprisonment is 10 years or more;

 

(e) the offence is not an offence, prosecuted by way of indictment, for which the maximum term of imprisonment is 10 years, that

 

(i) resulted in bodily harm,

 

(ii) involved the import, export, trafficking or production of drugs, or

 

(iii) involved the use of a weapon; and

 

(f) the offence is not an offence, prosecuted by way of indictment, under any of the following provisions:

 

(i) section 144 (prison breach),

 

(ii) section 264 (criminal harassment),

 

(iii) section 271 (sexual assault),

 

(iv) section 279 (kidnapping),

 

(v) section 279.02 (trafficking in persons — material benefit),

 

(vi) section 281 (abduction of person under fourteen),

 

(vii) section 333.1 (motor vehicle theft),

 

(viii) paragraph 334(a) (theft over $5000),

 

(ix) paragraph 348(1)(e) (breaking and entering a place other than a dwelling‑house),

 

(x) section 349 (being unlawfully in a dwelling‑house), and

 

(xi) section 435 (arson for fraudulent purpose).

[13]                        While there have been various amendments, the structure of s. 742.1 remains substantially the same as that described in Proulx. In particular, three prerequisites must be met before a conditional sentence can be imposed:

(1)   the offender was not convicted of one of the offences listed at paras. 742.1(b) through (f) (“exclusionary provisions”);

(2)   a court would otherwise impose a sentence of imprisonment of fewer than two years (see Proulx, at paras. 49‑61); and

(3)   the safety of the community would not be endangered by the offender serving the sentence in the community (see Proulx, at paras. 62‑76).

[14]                        Where these prerequisites are met, a court must consider whether a conditional sentence is appropriate, having regard to the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2 (Proulx, at paras. 77‑78).

IV.         Judicial History

A.           The Sentencing Decision: Ontario Superior Court of Justice, 2018 ONSC 1141, 405 C.R.R. (2d) 119

[15]                        Ms. Sharma’s sentencing was contested. The Crown provided Ms. Sharma notice of the mandatory minimum sentence (as required by s. 8 of the CDSA) and sought a sentence of six years’ imprisonment. Ms. Sharma sought a conditional sentence and community service. Three legislative barriers stood in her way: s. 6(3)(a.1) of the CDSA, which set out a mandatory minimum sentence of two years’ imprisonment; s. 742.1(b) of the Criminal Code, which made conditional sentences unavailable for any offence with a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment; and s. 742.1(c) of the Criminal Code, which made conditional sentences unavailable for any offence with a maximum term of imprisonment of 14 years or life. Ms. Sharma brought Charter challenges against all three provisions, alleging that s. 6(3)(a.1) violates s. 12 and that ss. 742.1(b) and 742.1(c) violate ss. 7 and 15 (although she abandoned her s. 7 arguments during oral submissions).

[16]                        In light of these constitutional challenges, the Crown unilaterally rescinded the s. 8 CDSA notice (so that the mandatory minimum sentence would not apply to Ms. Sharma). The Crown recommended a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment. While this left the constitutionality of s. 6(3)(a.1) moot, the sentencing judge chose to decide the issue, concluding that it violated s. 12 of the Charter and could not be saved under s. 1. As the mandatory minimum sentence did not apply in the circumstances, the constitutionality of s. 742.1(b) was also moot and was not decided.

[17]                        The sentencing judge heard testimony from one expert witness: Dr. Carmela Murdocca. Dr. Murdocca is an Associate Professor in the Department of Sociology at York University and studies “racialization, criminalization and social exclusion of Indigenous and racialized peoples in Canada” (para. 18). Dr. Murdocca’s report indicated that “[a]spects of Indigenous women’s social, economic and cultural experiences often inform their participation in serious offences” (para. 23). She further opined that “specific indicators”, such as economic disadvantage and poverty, may render some Indigenous women “more vulnerable to being conscripted into drug couriering” (para. 25). In this way, Dr. Murdocca’s testimony connected drug‑related offences committed by Indigenous women to “the legacies of colonia[l] racism” (para. 25).

[18]                        Dr. Murdocca also testified about the unavailability of conditional sentences for certain drug offences. The introduction of mandatory minimum sentences for drug trafficking crimes, together with the removal of conditional sentences for any offence with a mandatory minimum, impeded the sentencing regime’s capacity to account for the “contextual and intersectional factors that render Indigenous women vulnerable to [committing] drug crimes” (para. 26).

[19]                        The sentencing judge held that the mandatory minimum sentence required by s. 6(3)(a.1) of the CDSA was grossly disproportionate in Ms. Sharma’s circumstances, and infringed s. 12. A fit sentence was 18 months’ imprisonment. The Crown did not appeal this ruling.

[20]                        Addressing s. 15, and having regard to the evidence before him, the sentencing judge dismissed Ms. Sharma’s challenge to s. 742.1(c). Ms. Sharma had adduced “no statistical information” on the impact of removing conditional sentences for various offences (para. 257). He questioned whether such impact existed, noting that sentencing judges “maintai[n] a broad discretion to do justice in individual cases including the imposition of less punitive sanctions for serious offences” (para. 258). The length of sentence remains within the discretion of a sentencing judge, and other alternatives to imprisonment remain, including suspended sentences and probation.

B.            Court of Appeal for Ontario, 2020 ONCA 478, 152 O.R. (3d) 209

[21]                        Ms. Sharma appealed her sentence and the dismissal of her s. 15 challenge to s. 742.1(c); she sought a 24‑month conditional sentence. The Court of Appeal also allowed Ms. Sharma to challenge, for the first time, the constitutionality of s. 742.1(e)(ii). Further, the Court of Appeal allowed Ms. Sharma to renew her s. 7 challenge to s. 742.1(c). The majority allowed Ms. Sharma’s appeal, holding that the impugned provisions infringed both ss. 7 and 15, and sentenced her to time served.

[22]                        As to s. 15, the majority held that the impugned provisions, while facially neutral, created a distinction between Indigenous and non‑Indigenous offenders. The constitutionality of s. 742.1 could not be determined without understanding s. 718.2(e). As s. 718.2(e) was introduced to address “substantive inequality” in the criminal justice system, undermining its operation by restricting the availability of conditional sentences had the effect of perpetuating substantive inequality (paras. 70 and 79). Where, as here, a law removes a remedial provision that was put in place to alleviate the discriminatory effect of other laws, then the removal of that remedial provision may not create a new distinction, but it will reinforce, perpetuate, or exacerbate the discriminatory effect that was intended to be alleviated by the remedial provision. The effect of the impugned provisions was to exacerbate the disadvantage faced by Indigenous offenders. This was apparent even in the absence of statistical evidence. In the majority’s view, it was an error in law for the sentencing judge to require Ms. Sharma to lead statistical evidence to show this.

[23]                        With respect to s. 7, the majority found that the impugned provisions’ purpose was to “maintain the integrity of the justice system by ensuring that offenders who commit serious offences receive prison sentences” (para. 148). In light of this purpose, the legislation was not arbitrary, but it was overbroad. Parliament intended to ensure offenders who committed serious crimes went to jail, but the impugned provisions jailed offenders “regardless of the underlying conduct of any particular offender” (para. 158). Parliament could have narrowed the reach of the provisions or provided for judicial discretion in exceptional cases, but did not. The Crown advanced no arguments to justify the s. 7 breach under s. 1. Accordingly, the majority struck down the provisions.

[24]                        The dissenting judge held that the impugned provisions did not infringe Ms. Sharma’s ss. 7 or 15 rights. On s. 15(1), he observed that the proper analytical framework was the subject of controversy. The dissenting judge agreed with the majority that Ms. Sharma’s claim met the first step. However, the majority’s application of the test would have the effect of “immunizing ordinary legislation from amendment or repeal” (para. 189). This was impermissible. Parliament had no constitutional obligation to establish the conditional sentencing regime and, therefore, must be allowed to repeal it. In his view, Ms. Sharma failed to demonstrate that the impugned provisions were arbitrary or unfair, a necessary element under the second step of the s. 15(1) framework. The legislation did not infringe her s. 15 rights.

[25]                        On s. 7, the dissenting judge generally agreed with the majority’s characterization of the legislation. Contrary to the majority, he held that the impugned provisions are not overbroad, as Parliament’s decision to use maximum sentences as a “rough indicia of seriousness” was appropriate (para. 283).

V.           Analysis

[26]                        As a preliminary point, we note that, at the Court of Appeal, Ms. Sharma challenged the constitutionality of s. 742.1(c) and s. 742.1(e)(ii). The majority held that Ms. Sharma was “affected by both preclusions” (para. 66). We do not see Ms. Sharma as being affected by s. 742.1(e)(ii), as it applies only to offences for which the maximum term of imprisonment is 10 years. That said, as the majority of the Court of Appeal considered s. 742.1(e)(ii), and as the parties made submissions on it before this Court, we will address its constitutionality.

A.           Section 15

[27]                        Section 15(1) of the Charter states:

15 (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.

[28]                        The two‑step test for assessing a s. 15(1) claim is not at issue in this case. It requires the claimant to demonstrate that the impugned law or state action:

(a)   creates a distinction based on enumerated or analogous grounds, on its face or in its impact; and

(b)   imposes a burden or denies a benefit in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating disadvantage (R. v. C.P., 2021 SCC 19, at paras. 56 and 141; Fraser v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 SCC 28, at para. 27; Kahkewistahaw First Nation v. Taypotat, 2015 SCC 30, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 548, at paras. 19‑20).

[29]                        While this framework is set out in the above‑cited cases, its proper application and the burden of proof at each step is not clear. That is particularly so in cases of adverse impact discrimination, which “occurs when a seemingly neutral law has a disproportionate impact on members of groups protected on the basis of an enumerated or analogous ground” (Fraser, at para. 30; see also Withler v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 12, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 396, at para. 64; Taypotat, at para. 22). Rather than explicitly singling out members of the protected group for differential treatment, the law does so indirectly (Fraser, at para. 30). This is the allegation here: that, while facially neutral, the impugned provisions disproportionately impact Ms. Sharma, as an Indigenous woman. 

[30]                        Uncertainty in the evidentiary burden in adverse impact cases has arisen when courts collapse the two steps of analysis into one, as the majority at the Court of Appeal did here (see para. 83). The two steps are not watertight compartments or “impermeable silos” (Fraser, at para. 82), since each step considers the impact of the impugned law on the protected group. While there may be overlap in the evidence that is relevant at each step, the two steps ask fundamentally different questions. As such, the analysis at each step must remain distinct from the other.

[31]                        The first step examines whether the impugned law created or contributed to a disproportionate impact on the claimant group based on a protected ground. This necessarily entails drawing a comparison between the claimant group and other groups or the general population (Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia, 1989 CanLII 2 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 143, at p. 164). The second step, in turn, asks whether that impact imposes burdens or denies benefits in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating a disadvantage. The conclusion that an impugned law has a disproportionate impact on a protected group (step one) does not lead automatically to a finding that the distinction is discriminatory (step two).

[32]                        Deciding the issues raised in this appeal requires us to resolve three particular uncertainties associated with the s. 15(1) framework:

(a)   whether the claimant must prove that the impugned law or state conduct caused (in the sense of created or contributed to) the disproportionate impact on the claimant;

(b)   whether the entire legislative context is relevant to the s. 15(1) inquiry; and

(c)   whether s. 15(1) imposes a positive obligation on the legislature to enact remedial legislation, and relatedly, whether the legislature can incrementally address disadvantage.

[33]                        On a careful reading, this Court’s jurisprudence answers these questions. In so saying, we do not alter the two‑step test for s. 15(1). Rather, we seek to bring clarity and predictability to its application, with a view to assisting parties to Charter challenges, judges adjudicating them, and legislators seeking to further s. 15’s equality guarantee.

[34]                        We add that it should not be surprising that clarification is necessary. This Court has described s. 15(1) as the Charter’s “most conceptually difficult provision” (Law v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), 1999 CanLII 675 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497, at para. 2). The development of its analytical framework is “daunting” (B. McLachlin, P.C., “Equality: The Most Difficult Right” (2001), 14 S.C.L.R. (2d) 17, at p. 17), and it has gone through multiple formulations since 1989 (A. Puchta, “Quebec v A and Taypotat: Unpacking the Supreme Court’s Latest Decisions on Section 15 of the Charter” (2018), 55 Osgoode Hall L.J. 665, at p. 665). Academics have criticized the current framework from various perspectives, the common thread being that it is unclear and, thus, leads to inconsistent application (see, e.g., J. Koshan and J. Watson Hamilton, “Meaningless Mantra: Substantive Equality after Withler” (2011), 16 Rev. Const. Stud. 31, at p. 61; M. Young, “Unequal to the Task: ‘Kapp’ing the Substantive Potential of Section 15” (2010), 50 S.C.L.R. (2d) 183, at p. 185; R. Moon, “Comment on Fraser v Canada (AG): The More Things Change” (2021), 30:2 Const. Forum 85).

[35]                        Our analysis proceeds in two parts. First, we provide guidance on the application of both steps of the s. 15(1) framework, with a preliminary point about the relationship between substantive equality and the two‑step test. Under the first step, we discuss causation and its relationship with the evidentiary burden to establish disproportionate impact. Under the second step, we discuss three key issues: (1) the claimant’s evidentiary burden to establish that a distinction is discriminatory; (2) the role of legislative context; and (3) the scope of the state’s obligations to remedy social inequalities. Second, we apply the s. 15(1) framework to the impugned provisions.

[36]                        We conclude that Ms. Sharma has not satisfied her burden at the first step. She has not demonstrated that the impugned provisions create or contribute to increased imprisonment of Indigenous offenders for the relevant offences, relative to non‑Indigenous offenders. The sentencing judge found that Ms. Sharma adduced no statistical information showing that the law creates such a distinction. While evidence of statistical disparity may not have been required to advance her s. 15 claim, the sentencing judge was correct to find that Ms. Sharma had not met her evidentiary burden at the first step based on the record presented. The Court of Appeal erred by interfering with the sentencing judge’s finding of fact, and compounded this error by saying that no such evidentiary burden need be met.

(1)         Guidance on the Section 15(1) Framework

(a)           Preliminary Point About Substantive Equality

[37]                        Several recent decisions of this Court refer to substantive equality as the “animating norm” of s. 15 (Fraser, at para. 42, citing Withler, at para. 2; R. v. Kapp, 2008 SCC 41, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 483, at paras. 15‑16; Quebec (Attorney General) v. Alliance du personnel professionnel et technique de la santé et des services sociaux, 2018 SCC 17, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 464, at para. 25). In these decisions, the Court stated that s. 15 of the Charter specifically protects substantive equality.

[38]                        The means by which substantive equality is protected is the application of the two-step test, as set out within each of these decisions (Fraser, at para. 27; Withler, at para. 30; Kapp, at para. 17; Alliance, at para. 25). This test has been affirmed repeatedly at this Court. While our colleague stresses the “touchstone” of substantive equality, a court’s focus must ultimately be directed to the test, as stated by the jurisprudence. And where, applying that test, the claimant’s burden at either step of s. 15(1) is not met, there is no infringement of s. 15 (and, therefore, no substantively unequal outcome).

(b)         Step One: Proving the Law, on its Face or in its Impact, Creates or Contributes to a Distinction on the Basis of a Protected Ground

[39]                        Two questions arise. First, what is the standard by which courts should measure impact? And secondly, how may claimants prove impact?

[40]                        We start with the difference between impact and disproportionate impact. All laws are expected to impact individuals; merely showing that a law impacts a protected group is therefore insufficient. At step one of the s. 15(1) test, claimants must demonstrate a disproportionate impact on a protected group, as compared to non‑group members. Said differently, leaving a gap between a protected group and non‑group members unaffected does not infringe s. 15(1).

[41]                        The disproportionate impact requirement necessarily introduces comparison into the first step. As McIntyre J. explained in Andrews: “[Equality] is a comparative concept, the condition of which may only be attained or discerned by comparison with the condition of others in the social and political setting in which the question arises” (p. 164; see also Fraser, at para. 55). This Court no longer requires a “mirror comparator group” (Withler, at paras. 55‑64; Fraser, at para. 94). However, Withler confirms that comparison plays a role at both steps of the s. 15(1) analysis. At the first step, the word “distinction” itself implies that the claimant is treated differently than others, whether directly or indirectly (Withler, at para. 62, cited in Fraser, at para. 48).

[42]                        As we have explained, in adverse impact cases, the law appears facially neutral. At step one, the claimant must present sufficient evidence to prove the impugned law, in its impact, creates or contributes to a disproportionate impact on the basis of a protected ground (Fraser, at para. 60, citing Taypotat, at para. 34; Alliance, at para. 26; Symes v. Canada, 1993 CanLII 55 (SCC), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 695, at pp. 764-65). Causation is thus a central issue. In Withler, the Court observed:

In other cases, establishing the distinction will be more difficult, because what is alleged is indirect discrimination: that although the law purports to treat everyone the same, it has a disproportionately negative impact on a group or individual that can be identified by factors relating to enumerated or analogous grounds. . . . In that kind of case, the claimant will have more work to do at the first step. [para. 64]

[43]                        Since the Charter’s adoption, “claimants have been required to demonstrate, through evidence, some sort of nexus between a particular action of the state, such as legislation, and an infringement of a Charter right or freedom” (Weatherley v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 158, at para. 42 (CanLII), citing RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd., 1986 CanLII 5 (SCC), [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573; Operation Dismantle Inc. v. The Queen, 1985 CanLII 74 (SCC), [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441, at pp. 447 and 490; Symes, at pp. 764‑65; Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), 2000 SCC 44, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 307, at para. 60; Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, 2013 SCC 72, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1101, at paras. 73‑78; Kazemi Estate v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 2014 SCC 62, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 176, at paras. 126 and 131‑34; R. v. Kokopenace, 2015 SCC 28, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 398, at paras. 251‑53).

[44]                        This is confirmed by a long line of s. 15 jurisprudence: the claimant must establish a link or nexus between the impugned law and the discriminatory impact. In Symes, the Court stressed the importance of distinguishing between adverse impacts “caused” or “contributed to” by the impugned law and those which “exist independently of” the impugned provision or the state action (p. 765). As Abella J. explained in Taypotat:

. . . intuition may well lead us to the conclusion that the provision has some disparate impact, but before we put the [government] to the burden of justifying a breach of s. 15 . . ., there must be enough evidence to show a prima facie breach. While the evidentiary burden need not be onerous, the evidence must amount to more than a web of instinct. [para. 34]

[45]                        The causation requirement between the impugned law or state action and the disproportionate impact is recognized in the jurisprudence through the words “created” or “contributed to”. Section 15(1) claimants must demonstrate that the impugned law or state action created or contributed to the disproportionate impact on the claimant group at step one (Symes, at p. 765). Both terms ⸺ “created” and “contributed to” ⸺ describe cause. “Contributed to” merely recognizes that the impugned law need not be the only or the dominant cause of the disproportionate impact.

[46]                        This is consonant with Fraser. In that case, Abella J. confirmed that once a claimant demonstrates that the impugned law or state action creates or contributes to the disproportionate impact on a group, they need not go further and show exactly why the law being challenged has that impact (Fraser, at paras. 63 and 70; Weatherley, at paras. 66‑75).

[47]                        Two examples illuminate Abella J.’s reasoning from Fraser and the associated burden of proof on a claimant at step one. In Fraser, the claimants had to demonstrate that the pension plan created or contributed to an adverse impact on the enumerated ground of sex. Said differently, the claimants had to prove that state action (the legislated restrictions to the pension plan) created or contributed to the impact (disproportionately reduced pensions) for individuals who were part of a protected group (women). The Court, however, imposed no further burden of demonstrating that being part of a protected group caused the impact: the claimants did not have to prove they were unable to acquire full‑time pension credit because they were women.

[48]                        For the Court, Abella J. relied on Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971), to illustrate her reasoning. In Griggs, the claimant did not have to show that he was denied employment opportunities because he was African American. However, the claimant did have to establish that the high school education requirement created or contributed to the adverse effect of disqualifying African Americans for those jobs as compared to other applicants. Demonstrating that a law created or contributed to a disproportionate impact on a protected group is sufficient for step one.

[49]                        In confirming the claimant’s causation burden at step one, we are mindful of the evidentiary hurdles and the asymmetry of knowledge (relative to the state) that many claimants face. In Fraser, Abella J. referred to two types of evidence that are helpful in proving that a law has a disproportionate impact: evidence about the “full context of the claimant group’s situation” (Withler, at para. 43, cited in Fraser, at para. 57) and evidence about “the outcomes that the impugned law or policy . . . has produced in practice” (Fraser, at para. 58.) Ideally, claims of adverse impact discrimination should be supported by both (para. 60). To give proper effect to the promise of s. 15(1), however, a claimant’s evidentiary burden cannot be unduly difficult to meet. In that regard, courts should bear in mind the following considerations:

(a)   No specific form of evidence is required.

(b)   The claimant need not show the impugned law or state action was the only or the dominant cause of the disproportionate impact ⸺ they need only demonstrate that the law was a cause (that is, the law created or contributed to the disproportionate impact on a protected group).

(c)   The causal connection may be satisfied by a reasonable inference. Depending on the impugned law or state action at issue, causation may be obvious and require no evidence. Where evidence is required, courts should remain mindful that statistics may not be available. Expert testimony, case studies, or other qualitative evidence may be sufficient. In all circumstances, courts should examine evidence that purports to demonstrate a causal connection to ensure that it conforms with standards associated to its discipline.

(d)   Courts should carefully scrutinize scientific evidence (see National Judicial Institute, Science Manual for Canadian Judges (2018); see also National Research Council and Federal Judicial Center, Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence (3rd ed. 2011)).

(e)   If the scientific evidence is novel, courts should admit it only if it has a “reliable foundation” (R. v. J.-L.J., 2000 SCC 51, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 600, at para. 33; see also R. v. Trochym, 2007 SCC 6, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 239, at para. 36).

[50]                        In summary, the first step asks whether the impugned provisions create or contribute to a disproportionate impact on the claimant group based on a protected ground as compared to other groups. If a claimant establishes that the law or state action creates or contributes to a disproportionate impact, the court should proceed to the second step. But to be clear, while the evidentiary burden at the first step should not be undue, it must be fulfilled. The particular evidentiary burden on claimants will depend on the claim. What remains consistent is that there is a burden on claimants at step one.

(c)           Step Two: Proving the Law Imposes Burdens or Denies Benefits in a Manner That Has the Effect of Reinforcing, Perpetuating, or Exacerbating Their Disadvantage

(i)            Evidentiary Burden

[51]                        It has never been the view of this Court that every distinction is discriminatory (Andrews, at p. 182). Hence the importance of the second step of the s. 15(1) test, requiring the claimant to establish that the impugned law imposes burdens or denies benefits in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating the group’s disadvantage. The question becomes, what does it mean to reinforce, perpetuate, or exacerbate disadvantage?

[52]                        Courts must examine the historical or systemic disadvantage of the claimant group. Leaving the situation of a claimant group unaffected is insufficient to meet the step two requirements. Two decisions of this Court demonstrate this point. In Fraser, Abella J. observed: “The goal is to examine the impact of the harm caused to the affected group”, which may include economic exclusion or disadvantage, social exclusion, psychological harms, physical harms or political exclusion (para. 76 (emphasis added), citing C. Sheppard, Inclusive Equality: The Relational Dimensions of Systemic Discrimination in Canada (2010), at pp. 62‑63). In Withler, this Court explained that a negative impact or worsened situation was required:

Whether the s. 15 analysis focusses on perpetuating disadvantage or stereotyping, the analysis involves looking at the circumstances of members of the group and the negative impact of the law on them. The analysis is contextual, not formalistic, grounded in the actual situation of the group and the potential of the impugned law to worsen their situation. [para. 37]

[53]                        This Court has outlined several factors that may assist a judge in determining whether claimants have met their burden at step two: arbitrariness, prejudice, and stereotyping. These factors are not necessary components; while “[t]hey may assist in showing that a law has negative effects on a particular group, . . . they ‘are neither separate elements of the Andrews test, nor categories into which a claim of discrimination must fit’” (Fraser, at para. 78, citing Quebec (Attorney General) v. A, 2013 SCC 5, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 61, at para. 329). Nonetheless, courts may usefully consider whether these factors are present:

(a)   Stereotyping or prejudice: These factors played a critical role at step two in Ontario (Attorney General) v. G, 2020 SCC 38. There, the Court held that the impugned law had a discriminatory impact because it furthered stereotypes and “prejudicial notions” about persons with disabilities (para. 62), reinforced “the stigmatizing idea that those with mental illness are inherently and permanently dangerous” and, in so doing, perpetuated the disadvantage they experienced (para. 65).

(b)   Arbitrariness: A distinction that does not withhold access to benefits or impose burdens, or that is based on an individual’s actual capacities, will rarely be discriminatory (Andrews, at pp. 174‑75). Abella J. described the role that arbitrariness can play in the analysis in both Quebec v. A (at paras. 221 and 331) and Taypotat (at paras. 16, 18, 20, 28 and 34). Taypotat focused on “arbitrary — or discriminatory — disadvantage, that is, whether the impugned law fails to respond to the actual capacities and needs of the members of the group and instead imposes burdens or denies a benefit in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating or exacerbating their disadvantage” (para. 20 (emphasis added)).

[54]                        Again, Fraser is illustrative. To recall, at step one, the claimants had to demonstrate that the pension plan created or contributed to a disproportionate impact on the enumerated ground of sex. Once that requirement was met, at step two they had to show that the disproportionate impact imposed burdens or denied benefits in a manner that had the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating or exacerbating the historic or systemic disadvantage against that group. Since pension plans have been historically designed “for middle and upper‑income full‑time employees with long service, typically male” (para. 108, citing Report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Pensions in Ontario (1980), at p. 116), the state action “perpetuate[d] a long‑standing source of economic disadvantage for women” (para. 113). Thereby, the second step was satisfied.

[55]                        In light of that test, it is helpful to underline three points regarding the evidentiary burden at step two:

(a)   The claimant need not prove that the legislature intended to discriminate (Fraser, at para. 69; Ontario v. G, at para. 46, citing Eldridge v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 1997 CanLII 327 (SCC), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 624, at para. 62; Andrews, at p. 173).

(b)   Judicial notice can play a role at step two. As this Court recognized in Law, “a court may take judicial notice of notorious and undisputed facts, or of facts which are capable of immediate and accurate demonstration, by resorting to readily accessible sources of indisputable accuracy” (para. 77, citing J. Sopinka, S. N. Lederman and A. W. Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada (1992), at p. 976). Of note here, the Court has taken judicial notice of the history of colonialism and how it translates into higher levels of incarceration for Indigenous peoples (R. v. Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433, at para. 60).

(c)   Courts may infer that a law has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating disadvantage, where such an inference is supported by the available evidence (Law, at para. 75). One must bear in mind, however, that inference is not mere assertion; nor is it a priori reasoning.

(ii)         Legislative Context

[56]                        To determine whether a distinction is discriminatory under the second step, courts should also consider the broader legislative context.

[57]                        Such an approach is well‑supported in our jurisprudence. In Vriend v. Alberta, 1998 CanLII 816 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 493, this Court held “[t]he comprehensive nature of the Act must be taken into account in considering the effect of excluding one ground from its protection” (para. 96). Similarly, in Withler, the analysis was said to entail consideration of “the full context of the claimant group’s situation and the actual impact of the law on that situation” (para. 43). Where the impugned provision is part of a larger legislative scheme (as is often so), the Court explained, that broader scheme must be accounted for (para. 3), and the “ameliorative effect of the law on others and the multiplicity of interests it attempts to balance will also colour the discrimination analysis” (para. 38 (emphasis added)). In Taypotat, Abella J. harboured “serious doubts” that the impugned law imposed arbitrary disadvantage, particularly after considering the context of the relevant legislation “as a whole” (para. 28).

[58]                        Most recently, in C.P., the constitutionality of s. 37(10) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1 (“YCJA”) was at issue. The impugned provision did not provide young persons an automatic right of appeal to this Court where an appellate judge below dissents on a question of law, as the Criminal Code provides to adult offenders. Chief Justice Wagner, writing for four members of this Court, explicitly and carefully considered the entire legislative scheme, observing that the YCJA is designed to balance multiple goals — not only enhanced procedural protections, but also timely intervention and prompt resolution (para. 146). He further explained that an “approach requiring line‑by‑line parity with the Criminal Code without reference to the distinct nature of the underlying scheme of the YCJA would indeed be contrary to the contextual approach” (para. 145). In choosing not to provide young persons with an automatic right to appeal, he concluded “Parliament did not discriminate against them, but responded to the reality of their lives” (para. 162). Therefore, step two was not satisfied. We would endorse this approach, as it is consistent with Withler, Taypotat, and Vriend.

[59]                        Relevant considerations include: the objects of the scheme, whether a policy is designed to benefit a number of different groups, the allocation of resources, particular policy goals sought to be achieved, and whether the lines are drawn mindful as to those factors (Withler, at para. 67; see also paras. 3, 38, 40 and 81).

[60]                        A contextual approach is particularly significant when analyzing the constitutionality of sentencing regimes. Here, the impugned provisions cannot properly be considered in a manner that is divorced from the broader context of sentencing law as provided for in Part XXIII of the Criminal Code. Part XXIII reflects a balance or interaction among the statutory principles set out in s. 718 of the Criminal Code, including rehabilitation, denunciation and deterrence, reparations to victims, separation from society, and the principle of restraint in s. 718.2(e). Also relevant to the legislative context is the internal limit contained in s. 718.2(e). The provision instructs courts to consider for all offenders “all available sanctions, other than imprisonment, that are reasonable in the circumstances and consistent with the harm done to victims or to the community . . ., with particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders” (see Proulx, at paras. 94‑101).

[61]                        Parliament has the exclusive authority to legislate in matters of sentencing policy. There is no constitutional right to any particular sentence, including a conditional sentence (R. v. Serov, 2016 BCSC 636, 353 C.R.R. (2d) 264, at para. 35; R. v. Chen, 2021 BCSC 697, at para. 212 (CanLII)). Parliament had no positive obligation to create the conditional sentence regime. This Court stated in Proulx that Parliament could “have easily excluded specific offences” from the conditional sentencing regime when it came into force in 1996 (para. 79). It chose to do so later, and may choose to do so in the future. That is inherent in the role of Parliament, informed by experience and by the wishes of the electorate. As we explain in greater detail below, Parliament is not bound by its past policy choices, and sentencing legislation must be assessed on its own to determine whether it is constitutionally compliant, without having regard to the prior legislative scheme (Alliance, at para. 33). In the context of equality claims regarding criminal sentencing policy, an area of law that involves multi-faceted and complex policy considerations, the s. 15(1) analysis must be conducted with sensitivity and due regard to the present legislative scheme. 

(iii)        The Scope of the State’s Obligations to Remedy Social Inequalities

[62]                        Given the questions raised in this appeal, it is important to confirm two principles related to the government’s obligations under s. 15(1).

[63]                        First, s. 15(1) does not impose a general, positive obligation on the state to remedy social inequalities or enact remedial legislation (Thibaudeau v. Canada, 1995 CanLII 99 (SCC), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 627, at para. 37; Eldridge, at para. 73; Auton (Guardian ad litem of) v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 2004 SCC 78, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 657, at para. 41; Alliance, at para. 42). Were it otherwise, courts would be impermissibly pulled into the complex legislative domain of policy and resource allocation, contrary to the separation of powers. In Alliance, this Court struck down amendments to Quebec’s pay equity legislation that “interfere[d] with access to anti‑discrimination law” by undermining existing legislative pay equity protections (para. 39). But in so doing, Abella J. expressly declined to impose a “freestanding positive obligation on the state to enact benefit schemes to redress social inequalities” (para. 42). The Court further affirmed that s. 15(1) does not bind the legislature to its current policies:

I do not share the unions’ view that once Quebec adopted ss. 40 to 43, it was constitutionally required to keep them on the books, so that any modification in the type or extent of protection afforded by those provisions would amount to a constitutional violation. To accept that submission in these circumstances would constitutionalize the policy choice embodied in the first version of the Act, improperly shifting the focus of the analysis to the form of the law, rather than its effects. Instead, there is a discriminatory impact because, assessed on their own and regardless of the prior legislative scheme, the impugned provisions perpetuate the pre‑existing disadvantage of women. [Emphasis added; emphasis in original deleted; para. 33.]

[64]                        Secondly, this Court in Alliance confirmed that, when the state does legislate to address inequality, it can do so incrementally:

The result of finding that Quebec’s amendments breach s. 15 in this case is not, as Quebec suggests, to impose a freestanding positive obligation on the state to enact benefit schemes to redress social inequalities. Nor does it undermine the state’s ability to act incrementally in addressing systemic inequality. [Emphasis added; para. 42.]

[65]                        Incrementalism is deeply grounded in Charter jurisprudence. In R. v. Edwards Books and Art Ltd., 1986 CanLII 12 (SCC), [1986] 2 S.C.R. 713, the Court accepted that the state may implement reforms “one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind” (p. 772 (emphasis added)). Expanding on the passage in Edwards Books, La Forest J. confirmed in McKinney v. University of Guelph, 1990 CanLII 60 (SCC), [1990] 3 S.C.R. 229, that a legislature “must be given reasonable leeway to deal with problems one step at a time, to balance possible inequalities under the law against other inequalities resulting from the adoption of a course of action, and to take account of the difficulties, whether social, economic or budgetary, that would arise if it attempted to deal with social and economic problems in their entirety” (p. 317). He also emphasized that, generally, courts “should not lightly use the Charter to second‑guess legislative judgment as to just how quickly it should proceed in moving forward towards the ideal of equality” (p. 318). See also Schachter v. Canada, 1992 CanLII 74 (SCC), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 679; Gosselin v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2002 SCC 84, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 429; and Auton, at paras. 61‑62.

(2)         Application to the Impugned Provisions

[66]                        For the reasons that follow, we are of the view that Ms. Sharma’s claim fails at the first step of the s. 15(1) analysis. The impugned provisions do not create or contribute to a disproportionate impact on Ms. Sharma as an Indigenous offender.

[67]                        The sentencing judge rejected Ms. Sharma’s s. 15(1) claim, concluding that there was “difficulty on this record” identifying an impact that he would classify as a distinction (para. 257). He held that Ms. Sharma adduced “no statistical information” demonstrating that the legislation caused a distinction (ibid.).

[68]                        The Court of Appeal disagreed with the sentencing judge’s conclusion on the first step, relying on the observation that “Aboriginal offenders start from a place of substantive inequality in the criminal justice system” (para. 70). Since the impugned provisions removed a remedial provision designed to address overincarceration of Indigenous offenders, the effect was to “exacerbate the discriminatory effect” (para. 83).

[69]                        The Court of Appeal collapsed the two‑step s. 15(1) framework into a single step. In doing so, it erred in two ways. First, it failed to clearly delineate Ms. Sharma’s evidentiary burden at each step of analysis, using broad evidence of historic disadvantage to satisfy the causation burden at both steps:

The distinction that is created by the impact of the impugned provisions relates to the overincarceration of Aboriginal offenders, not their overrepresentation in the criminal justice system. By removing the ability to impose a conditional sentence instead of a prison sentence for an offence, the effect on an Aboriginal offender is to undermine the purpose and remedial effect of s. 718.2(e) in addressing the substantive inequality between Aboriginal and non‑Aboriginal people manifested in overincarceration within the criminal justice system, which has been acknowledged by Parliament and the courts as requiring redress. [Emphasis added; para. 79.]

[70]                        Secondly, when analyzing Ms. Sharma’s evidence at the first step, the court erred by using the second‑step s. 15(1) requirements:

Where a law establishes a new benefit, but does so in a discriminatory manner, that law will “create” a distinction. But where, as here, a law removes a remedial provision that was put in place to alleviate the discriminatory effect of other laws, then the removal of that remedial provision may not create a new distinction, but it will reinforce, perpetuate, or exacerbate the discriminatory effect that was intended to be alleviated by the remedial provision. [Emphasis added; para. 83.]

[71]                        To recall, the focus at the first step is on a disproportionate impact, not historic or systemic disadvantage. The Court of Appeal addressed the wrong question at step one, focusing on the link between colonial policies and overincarceration of Indigenous peoples. While the situation of the claimant group is relevant at step one (see Fraser, at paras. 56‑57), it is not sufficient on its own to establish disproportionate impact. Nor is it enough to show that the law restricts an ameliorative program.

[72]                        To explain this point, we must directly address Ms. Sharma’s argument before this Court. Ms. Sharma submits that “conditional sentences are inextricably connected with s. 718.2(e), which does draw a race‑based distinction, by expressly identifying Indigenous offenders as requiring particular consideration in the sentencing process. Any modification to the Gladue framework necessarily impacts Indigenous offenders differently than non‑Indigenous offenders” (R.F., at para. 63 (emphasis in original)). She further submits that “[w]hile the Impugned Provisions apply to both Indigenous and non‑Indigenous offenders, the undermining of the Gladue framework affects only Indigenous offenders” (para. 63). Our colleague adopts this argument, saying the distinction flows “from the combined effect of ss. 718.2(e) and 742.1” (para. 211).

[73]                        We accept that there is a link between the Gladue framework relating to s. 718.2(e) and the conditional sentence regime. Both were adopted as part of the same legislation aimed at reducing the use of prison as a sanction and expanding the use of restorative justice principles in sentencing (Gladue, at para. 48; Proulx, at paras. 15 and 18‑21; Wells, at para. 6). However, Ms. Sharma’s burden at step one was to demonstrate that the specific provisions she challenged created or contributed to a disproportionate impact on Indigenous offenders. While she did not have to prove that the impugned provisions removed access to a conditional sentence because she was Indigenous or that the impugned provisions were the only or the dominant cause of the disproportionate impact, she did have to demonstrate a causal connection.

[74]                        The sentencing judge did not accept that the impugned provisions disproportionately impact Indigenous offenders, for good reason. Dr. Murdocca testified that it was “unknown if recent statutory amendments that have restricted the use of conditional sentences may affect Aboriginal offenders disproportionately compared to non‑Aboriginal offenders” (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 86‑90 (emphasis added)). In light of all the evidence, the sentencing judge determined Ms. Sharma failed to satisfy step one. While the Court of Appeal overturned the sentencing judge’s conclusion, it failed to identify any evidence supporting Ms. Sharma’s argument that the impugned provisions created or contributed to a disproportionate impact on Indigenous offenders (see paras. 68‑89). In saying this, we recognize that the Court of Appeal relied on fresh evidence, adduced by interveners, and expert evidence from Dr. Murdocca. It examined this evidence, however, at step two of its analysis (see paras. 90‑105).

[75]                        We note here, in passing, our serious concern with interveners supplementing the record at the appellate level. As stated in R. v. Morgentaler, 1993 CanLII 158 (SCC), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 462, “[t]he purpose of an intervention is to present the court with submissions which are useful and different from the perspective of a non-party who has a special interest or particular expertise in the subject matter of the appeal” (p. 463, cited in R. v. Barton, 2019 SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579, at paras. 52‑53). Interveners must, however, accept the record as defined by the parties in first instance (Mikisew Cree First Nation v. Canada (Minister of Canadian Heritage), 2005 SCC 69, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 388; R. v. Marshall, 1999 CanLII 666 (SCC), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 533, at para. 9; R. v. Mabior, 2012 SCC 47, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 584, at para. 59). Interveners creating a new evidentiary record at the appellate level undermines the trial process. That is not how our system of justice, including constitutional adjudication, is designed to work.

[76]                        In short, the Court of Appeal erred by removing Ms. Sharma’s evidentiary burden at step one. This is inconsistent with the sentencing judge’s finding that Ms. Sharma failed to establish a distinction on the basis of a protected ground (para. 257). The Court of Appeal improperly substituted its own view of the matter. In this case, while Ms. Sharma was not required to adduce a specific type of evidence, she had to demonstrate that the impugned provisions created or contributed to a disproportionate impact. Ms. Sharma, for example, could have presented expert evidence or statistical data showing Indigenous imprisonment disproportionately increased for the specific offences targeted by the impugned provisions, relative to non‑Indigenous offenders, after the SSCA came into force. Such evidence might establish that the removal of conditional sentences created or contributed to a disproportionate impact on Indigenous offenders.

[77]                        By overturning the sentence, the Court of Appeal not only departed from its proper role but misapplied the jurisprudence of this Court. In light of the sentencing judge’s findings, Ms. Sharma’s argument before this Court ⸺ that the impugned provisions “necessarily impac[t] Indigenous offenders differently” ⸺ cannot be accepted.

[78]                        Ms. Sharma argued that removing the availability of conditional sentences undermined a trial judge’s ability to give effect to s. 718.2(e). She alleges that the removal of one “accommodation”, the availability of conditional sentences for certain offences, disproportionately impacts Indigenous offenders. We do not accept this argument. It is clear that s. 718.2(e) is still meaningfully operable, as it was given effect in this case. As long as judges retain broad discretion to impose a range of available sentences, we query whether altering a single sentencing provision could undermine s. 718.2(e) in the manner Ms. Sharma suggests.

[79]                        It is undisputed that the sentencing judge must take account of the particular circumstances of Indigenous offenders, as that is what Parliament has directed in s. 718.2(e). How this is to be done may take various forms and the Criminal Code provides judges broad discretion to craft a proportionate sentence, given the offender’s degree of responsibility, the gravity of the offence and the specific circumstance of each case (R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at para. 58). For instance, sentencing judges may consider other non‑carceral options such as suspended sentences and probation. They may also reduce sentences below the typical range. 

[80]                        It is true that suspended sentences are “primarily a rehabilitative sentencing tool”, whereas conditional sentences “address both punitive and rehabilitative objectives” (Proulx, at para. 23). Suspended sentences are not irrelevant to applying s. 718.2(e). Proulx does not prohibit judges from using suspended sentences “to endeavour to achieve a truly fit and proper sentence in the particular case” (Gladue, at para. 33). Where conditional sentences are unavailable, judges may give effect to s. 718.2(e) by considering suspended sentences with openness and flexibility. 

[81]                        In any event, and as we say, it is clear that s. 718.2(e) was given effect in the circumstances of this case. The judge sentenced Ms. Sharma to 18 months’ incarceration, taking into account her experience as an Indigenous person under the Gladue framework, which was well below the established range for similar offences (sentencing reasons, at para. 80). As a reminder, s. 718.2(e) does not guarantee that Indigenous offenders will not receive carceral sentences.

[82]                        As a final point, although our colleague assures us that “[r]epealing or amending s. 742.1, or even s. 718.2(e), will not automatically contravene s. 15(1)” (para. 244), the logical conclusion of her reasons suggests the contrary. While s. 718.2(e) sets out an important policy, it is a legislative provision, not a constitutional imperative, and it is open to Parliament to amend it, even if to narrow the circumstances in which it applies. Viewed in this light, our colleague’s proposition is novel and its implications are profound and far-reaching. Parliament would be prevented from repealing or amending existing ameliorative policies in many cases, unless courts are persuaded that such changes are justified under s. 1. This would amount to a transfer of sentencing policy-making from Parliament to judges. Such an outcome would be contrary to the separation of powers, at odds with decades of our jurisprudence stressing Parliament’s latitude over sentencing within constitutional limits, and must be rejected. 

[83]                        Given the above, there is no need to consider step two. Section 15(1) is not infringed.

B.            Section 7

(1)         Introduction

[84]                        Section 7 states:

7 Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.

[85]                        The parties agree that the impugned provisions limit Ms. Sharma’s liberty interests. The question that follows is whether they do so in a manner that accords with the principles of fundamental justice. Ms. Sharma argued before the Court of Appeal that the impugned provisions are arbitrary and overbroad. The majority agreed that the impugned provisions were overbroad, but not arbitrary. In our view, the impugned provisions are neither.

[86]                        Arbitrariness and overbreadth both consider the connection between the purpose of the impugned law and the limits it imposes on life, liberty, or security of the person (Bedford, at paras. 114-19). A law is arbitrary when it imposes limits on these interests in a way that bears no connection to its purpose ⸺ that is, when it “exacts a constitutional price in terms of rights, without furthering the public good that is said to be the object of the law” (Carter v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 5, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 331, at para. 83). And it is overbroad when it imposes limits on these interests in a manner that is not rationally connected to the purpose of the law (Bedford, at para. 112; Carter, at para. 85).

[87]                        As the law’s purpose is the principal reference point, its proper identification is crucial to the s. 7 analysis (R. v. Safarzadeh‑Markhali, 2016 SCC 14, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 180, at para. 24; R. v. Moriarity, 2015 SCC 55, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 485, at para. 24). Indeed, identifying a law’s purpose may be determinative of its constitutionality (R. J. Sharpe and K. Roach, The Charter of Rights and Freedoms (7th ed. 2021), at p. 279). It is important to characterize the purpose of a law at the appropriate level of generality (Safarzadeh‑Markhali, at para. 27; Moriarity, at para. 28). At one end of the spectrum lies an abstract purpose akin to the animating social value. At the other extreme is a “virtual repetition of the challenged provision, divorced from its context” (Safarzadeh‑Markhali, at para. 27). A proper framing of purpose lies somewhere between these two poles, and is precise and succinct (Moriarity, at para. 29).

[88]                        The most significant and reliable indicator of legislative purpose would, of course, be a statement of purpose within the subject law. Beyond that, generally, courts seeking to identify legislative purpose look to the text, context, and scheme of the legislation and extrinsic evidence, which can (subject to the caution we offer below) include Hansard, legislative history, government publications and the evolution of the impugned provisions (Safarzadeh‑Markhali, at para. 31; Moriarity, at para. 31; Application under s. 83.28 of the Criminal Code (Re), 2004 SCC 42, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 248, at para. 37).

[89]                        Extrinsic evidence should be used with caution. Statements of purpose in the legislative record may be rhetorical and imprecise (Safarzadeh‑Markhali, at para. 36; R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at p. 293). Decontextualized statements by members of Parliament can be poor indicators of parliamentary purpose (see, e.g., Canada (Attorney General) v. Whaling, 2014 SCC 20, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 392, at paras. 67‑68). What is to be identified is the purpose of Parliament, being that of its collective membership as expressed in its legislative act, and not the purposes of its individual members. As this Court has recognized in R. v. Heywood, 1994 CanLII 34 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 761, at p. 788, “the intent of particular members of Parliament is not the same as the intent of the Parliament as a whole”.

[90]                        Warnings of imprecision aside, legislative history can be useful in determining legislative purpose (Safarzadeh‑Markhali, at para. 36). Two stages in the legislative process are of particular assistance (and this is true both of Parliament and of provincial legislatures). At second reading, the Minister who introduces the legislation sets out, usually in a formal and structured way, what the legislation is intended to achieve and the means by which it seeks to do so. Second reading is approval in principle. Following such approval, legislation is referred to committee for detailed, clause‑by‑clause consideration. Explanations provided to the legislative committee by the Minister, the Minister’s Parliamentary Secretary or departmental officials can provide further authoritative statements regarding intent. At the federal level, procedures in the Senate parallel those of the House of Commons. Thus, the second reading speech by the Senator who introduces the legislation, as well as the explanations by departmental officials at committee hearings, can also be useful.

[91]                        Having reviewed whatever sources are available, courts should strive to arrive at a precise and succinct statement that faithfully represents the legislative purpose of the impugned provision (Safarzadeh‑Markhali, at para. 28; Moriarity, at para. 29). Overly broad, multifactorial statements of purpose can artificially make impugned provisions unassailable to arguments of overbreadth or arbitrariness. In Safarzadeh‑Markhali, the Court defined the purpose of denying enhanced credit for pre‑sentence custody as “enhanc[ing] public safety and security by increasing violent and chronic offenders’ access to rehabilitation programs” (para. 47 (emphasis deleted)). In R. v. Appulonappa, 2015 SCC 59, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 754, the purpose of the law was “to combat people smuggling” (para. 34; see also Moriarity, at para. 29). Courts must then use this same precise and succinct statement of purpose within the subsequent analysis. The statement of the purpose should be maintained and not change throughout the analysis.

(2)         Application to the Impugned Provisions

(a)           The Impugned Provisions Aim to Enhance Consistency in the Conditional Sentencing Regime by Making Imprisonment the Typical Punishment for Certain Serious Offences and Categories of Offences

[92]                        With these directions in mind, we turn to the first step of the analysis: determining the purpose of ss. 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii). As we will explain, the impugned provisions have the same purpose: to enhance consistency in the conditional sentencing regime by making imprisonment the typical punishment for certain serious offences and categories of offences.

[93]                        We consider it significant that the impugned provisions are contained within the exclusionary provisions, that is, paras. 742.1(b) through (f). These exclusionary provisions list offences and categories of offences for which conditional sentencings are unavailable. Parliament adopted these exclusionary provisions together in 2012 in the SSCA; the Minister’s second reading remarks to Parliament addressed these exclusions as a group. Given the legislative text, the purpose of the two impugned provisions — ss. 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii) — is the same. To hold otherwise would result in purposes tied too tightly to the means, which is impermissible.

[94]                        Two occurrences provide important background to Parliament’s introduction of the exclusionary provisions: this Court’s decision in Proulx and the 2007 amendments to s. 742.1. We explain each below.

[95]                        Proulx addressed the initial iteration of s. 742.1 and stated various considerations for judges when granting a conditional sentence. At that time, the exclusionary provisions were not part of s. 742.1. Several parties had argued that a presumption should apply against conditional sentences for certain serious offences, such as sexual offences against children, manslaughter and trafficking or possession of certain narcotics (para. 80). The Court dismissed those submissions, stating that “a conditional sentence is available in principle for all offences in which the statutory prerequisites are satisfied” (para. 79 (emphasis in original)). The Court explained that while the gravity of offences is relevant to determining whether a conditional sentence is appropriate in the circumstances, it was both “unwise and unnecessary to establish judicially created presumptions that conditional sentences are inappropriate for specific offences” (para. 81 (emphasis added); Wells, at para. 45).

[96]                        While this Court properly declined to create judicial exclusions, Parliament in the proper exercise of its authority did so through legislative amendment. As discussed, in 2007, Parliament amended s. 742.1. The 2007 amendments provide background to Parliament’s desire to introduce consistency into the regime in 2012. The 2007 amendments provided that conditional sentences would not be available to offenders convicted of a “serious personal injury offence”. When subsequently repealing this prerequisite, the Minister discussed that courts had defined “serious personal injury offences” inconsistently and in a manner that did not accord with parliamentary intent (House of Commons Debates, vol. 145, No. 38, 3rd Sess., 40th Parl., May 3, 2010, at pp. 2282-83).

[97]                        The current version of s. 742.1 was enacted in 2012 via the SSCA. The SSCA combined several previous bills that had died on the order paper after Parliament’s dissolution. Notably, the SSCA included a word‑for‑word reintroduction of Bill C-16, Ending House Arrest for Property and Other Serious Crimes by Serious and Violent Offenders Act, 3rd Sess., 40th Parl., 2010, which was initially meant to replace s. 742.1. To understand the current version of s. 742.1, we must go back to the second reading speeches for Bill C‑16, which originally introduced the amendments.

[98]                        The Minister’s second reading speech for Bill C‑16 explained that the amendments aimed to clarify that conditional sentences were not available for serious property and violent offences:

Bill C‑16 proposes amendments to the Criminal Code to ensure that conditional sentences are never available for serious and violent offenders, and serious property offences which were never intended to be eligible for a conditional sentence in the first place.

 

. . .

 

It is this aspect of the existing conditional sentencing provisions that are so problematic and this is what the bill before us today addresses. Rather than leaving it to the individual courts to determine whether a particular case qualifies as a serious personal injury offence, this bill clearly identifies all offences which will never be eligible for a conditional sentence. It removes the uncertainty and provides clarity to our law.

 

. . .

 

. . . [T]his bill would provide the needed clarity and the certainty to say which offences are not eligible for a conditional sentence. . . .

 

. . .

 

It is my view that the current conditional sentencing regime still fails to categorically make conditional sentences ineligible for many very serious crimes. Greater clarity and greater consistency is needed to limit the availability of conditional sentences and to protect Canadians from serious and violent offenders.

 

. . .

 

Conditional sentences are an appropriate sentencing tool, in many cases. However, access to them does need to be restricted when it comes to serious property and serious violent offences. [Emphasis added.]

 

(House of Commons Debates, May 3, 2010, at pp. 2282-84)

[99]                        Specific references were made to Bill C‑16 during the Minister’s second reading speech for the SSCA. The Minister reiterated that “these proposals seek to make it explicitly clear that a conditional sentence is never available for” the categories of offences and the specific offences enumerated (House of Commons Debates, vol. 146, No. 17, 1st Sess., 41st Parl., September 21, 2011, at p. 1299). At the second reading in the Senate, the Senator who introduced the legislation on behalf of the Minister emphasized that “[t]he lack of consistency [in conditional sentencing] is a problem in our justice system” (Debates of the Senate, vol. 148, No. 39, 1st Sess., 41st Parl., December 8, 2011, at p. 831). As the parliamentary record reveals, the SSCA was part of a larger initiative by Parliament to adopt a deterrence‑based approach to crime (Canadian Bar Association, Submission on Bill C‑10, Safe Streets and Communities Act, October 2011 (online), at p. 2). In furtherance of this approach, Parliament aimed to address what it saw as the use of conditional sentences for serious offences that warranted imprisonment.

[100]                     Parliament identified certain offences for which conditional sentences would not be available. The exclusionary provisions are precise: only specific offences or categories of offences trigger their application. Thus, Parliament sought to impose bright‑line limitations on the availability of conditional sentences.

[101]                     It is clear, from the text, context, scheme and extrinsic evidence, that a desire to enhance consistency in the conditional sentencing regime by making imprisonment the typical punishment for certain serious offences and categories of offences was the object of these amendments. This is the purpose of the exclusionary provisions.

[102]                     The means by which Parliament achieved this purpose was to remove the availability of a conditional sentence for certain offences and categories of offences. In doing so, Parliament left open the possibility that relatively less serious criminal behaviour can receive a non‑carceral sentence (suspended sentence, probation, conditional discharge, etc.) or a flexible carceral sentence (intermittent sentence). Parliament made clear, however, that an offender should generally be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for offences listed in the exclusionary provisions.

[103]                     Finally, the effect of the exclusionary provisions of s. 742.1 is to reduce the number of offenders who serve their sentences in the community.

(b)         The Impugned Provisions Are Not Overbroad

[104]                     The Court of Appeal found “no rational connection between the impugned provisions’ purpose and some of their effects” (para. 174). Inasmuch as the impugned provisions prevent offenders who commit non‑serious offences from receiving a conditional sentence, they are overbroad (para. 174). Maximum sentence, which the provisions use as a marker of seriousness, is not, in the Court of Appeal’s view, a suitable proxy (para. 164).

[105]                     As we have explained, in enacting the impugned provisions, Parliament intended to enhance consistency in the conditional sentencing regime by making imprisonment the typical punishment for certain serious offences and categories of offences. Given this purpose, the Court of Appeal erred in three ways. First, maximum sentence is a suitable proxy for seriousness. Second, the definition of a serious offence is a normative assessment in respect of which Parliament must be granted significant leeway. And finally, the Court of Appeal confused seriousness of an offence with the circumstances of an offender and their moral culpability. We explain each point in turn.

[106]                     First, this Court has repeatedly accepted that the maximum sentence for an offence is a reflection of, and a proxy for, its seriousness (R. v. M. (C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at paras. 36 and 56; R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, at paras. 95‑96; R. v. Parranto, 2021 SCC 46, at para. 60; R. v. St‑Cloud, 2015 SCC 27, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 328, at para. 60; Chiarelli v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), 1992 CanLII 87 (SCC), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 711, at p. 734). In many areas, Parliament has structured policies using maximum sentence as the measure for seriousness — e.g., the availability of absolute and conditional discharges (Criminal Code, s. 730(1)); record suspensions (Criminal Records Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-47, s. 4(2)(b)); and inadmissibility to Canada in the immigration context (Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, s. 36(1)(a)). In the present case, Parliament’s primary aim was to enhance consistency in sentencing. It determined that bright‑line rules, drawn by reference to the maximum sentence, are the best way to achieve this goal. Deference towards Parliament is particularly apt given that the concept of “serious offences” is not subject to precise definition.

[107]                     This leads us to the second error we identify in the Court of Appeal’s overbreadth analysis. Reasonable people may disagree about which offences are “serious” enough to warrant jail sentences. These are judgment calls, and there is no obvious reason to prefer one or the other. Ultimately, as this Court has maintained, the call rests not with the preferences of judges, but with those collectively expressed by Parliament as representatives of the electorate. As explained in R. v. Lloyd, 2016 SCC 13, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 130, at para. 45:

Parliament has the power to make policy choices with respect to the imposition of punishment for criminal activities and the crafting of sentences that it deems appropriate to balance the objectives of deterrence, denunciation, rehabilitation and protection of society.

[108]                     Finally, to the extent the Court of Appeal pointed to Ms. Sharma’s circumstances as demonstrative of Parliament’s overreach, it collapsed the concept of seriousness of the offence into the concepts of circumstances of the offender and particulars of the crime. On this point, we endorse the sentencing judge’s comments: “[Ms. Sharma] committed a serious offence in importing cocaine ⸺ a reality undisturbed by her personal culpability or mitigating factors” (para. 141 (emphasis added)). The Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan made a similar point in R. v. Neary, 2017 SKCA 29, [2017] 7 W.W.R. 730: “The gravity and seriousness of the offences are not attenuated by the personal circumstances of the accused” (para. 39). We accept entirely that the circumstances which led Ms. Sharma to import drugs are tragic and that her moral culpability was thereby attenuated (which was reflected in a sentence of 18 months rather than the six years initially proposed by the Crown). But those facts do not make importation of a Sch. I substance, particularly in the quantity she carried, any less serious.

[109]                     Given the purpose of the impugned provisions articulated above and their effects, we conclude that they are not overbroad.

(c)           The Impugned Provisions Are Not Arbitrary

[110]                     Ms. Sharma submits that the impugned provisions are arbitrary, as they create a “gap” in the sanctions available for sentencing judges. The idea is that, where a proportionate sentence would have been a conditional sentence, it follows that the sentence actually imposed as a result of the impugned provisions would be either too high or too low.

[111]                     But the existence of a “gap”, if indeed there is one, does not speak to arbitrariness. Rather, arbitrariness exists where there is no connection between the effect of a provision and its purpose. That understood, the impugned provisions are not arbitrary. As stated before, their purpose is to enhance consistency in the conditional sentencing regime by making imprisonment the typical punishment for certain serious offences and categories of offences. Where a sentencing judge determines that a jail sentence is warranted, offenders convicted of those offences will serve their sentences in jail, rather than in the community. There is an obvious connection between the effect of the provisions and their purpose, and Ms. Sharma’s rights are not limited arbitrarily.

[112]                     Therefore, while s. 742.1 limits Ms. Sharma’s liberty interests, it does so in a manner that accords with the principles of fundamental justice. Accordingly, it is unnecessary for us to have regard to s. 1, as no limit of ss. 15 or 7 has been established.

VI.         Conclusion

[113]                     We would allow the appeal. Sections 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii) are constitutional. We would set aside the order of the Court of Appeal, and restore the sentence imposed at first instance. As Ms. Sharma has served her sentence, no further orders are required.

                  Karakatsanis J. —

I.               Introduction

[114]                     The overrepresentation of Indigenous people in Canada’s prisons is a present-day product of this country’s colonial past. As Indigenous incarceration rates have climbed, and those of Indigenous women have soared, some have compared Canadian correctional facilities to residential schools (see Truth and Reconciliation Commission, The Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, vol. 5, The Legacy (2015), at p. 219). Like residential schools before it, this overincarceration is an ongoing source of intergenerational harm to families and communities. It is a striking sign of the discrimination that Indigenous peoples experience in “all parts of the criminal justice system” (Ewert v. Canada, 2018 SCC 30, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 165, at para. 57). And it remains a poignant obstacle to realizing the constitutional imperative of reconciliation.

[115]                     Sentencing law cannot erase this country’s colonial past. Nor can it remove the causes behind an offender’s crime. But it is uniquely positioned to ameliorate — or aggravate — the racial inequalities in our criminal justice system. Ensuring that Canadian sentencing provisions are consistent with the liberty and equality guarantees under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is therefore essential. This case requires us to do so.

[116]                     Cheyenne Sharma, a 20-year-old Indigenous mother to an infant daughter, was owing two months’ rent, and facing eviction, when her then-partner made her an offer: fly to Suriname, collect a suitcase, and return with it to Canada, for $20,000. When agents for the Canada Border Services Agency cut into the luggage upon her return, they found nearly two kilograms of cocaine, worth around $130,000. Ms. Sharma was arrested and charged with importing over one kilogram of a prohibited substance, contrary to s. 6(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19 (CDSA).

[117]                     Ms. Sharma pleaded guilty, but challenged several provisions of the CDSA and the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, under ss. 7, 12 and 15(1) of the Charter. The trial judge sentenced Ms. Sharma to 18 months’ imprisonment, concluding that s. 742.1(c) of the Criminal Code — which prohibits conditional sentences for a range of offences — precluded him from imposing a community sentence. The Court of Appeal for Ontario then struck down ss. 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii) — the latter prohibiting conditional sentences for certain drug offences — as violating ss. 7 and 15(1) of the Charter. It substituted a conditional sentence of two years less a day. 

[118]                     I agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal. Sections 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii) infringe s. 7 because they deprive some individuals of their liberty in a manner that is overbroad: by using maximum sentences as a proxy for the seriousness of an offence, capturing the most and the least serious criminal conduct, they overstep their aim of punishing more serious offences with incarceration. And they infringe s. 15(1) because they impair the remedial effect of s. 718.2(e) — which directs judges to consider alternatives to imprisonment “with particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders” — in a manner that creates a distinction on the basis of race, and that reinforces, perpetuates, and exacerbates the historical disadvantages of Indigenous peoples.

[119]                     As the Crown has justified neither infringement under s. 1 of the Charter, I would conclude that the provisions are unconstitutional and would uphold the Court of Appeal’s declaration that they are of no force and effect under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. I would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal.

II.            Background

[120]                     We are all, in part, the product of our circumstances. In this appeal, Ms. Sharma’s own history intersects with three others: with the intergenerational effects of colonialism; with the corresponding, and rising, rates of Indigenous incarceration; and with Parliamentary and judicial responses to the sentencing of Indigenous offenders.

[121]                     Ms. Sharma belongs to the Saugeen First Nation and is of Ojibwa ancestry. The obstacles in her life have been formidable. The granddaughter of a residential school survivor, she lost her father at age 5, when he was arrested, deported to Trinidad, convicted of murder, and sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment. At age 13, having run away from home, she fell into alcoholism and was sexually assaulted. At age 15, employed as a sex worker, she nearly died of a drug overdose. At age 16, unable to afford the school uniform, she dropped out of high school. At age 17, abandoned by the father, she gave birth to a daughter. And at age 20, unsupported by the child’s father, behind on rent, and facing homelessness, she chose to commit the crime at issue. She has no other entry on her criminal record. Having already survived several suicide attempts, she lapsed into further depression, stress, anxiety, and alcohol dependency when her mother died during the sentencing proceedings. At the time of her sentence, she had moved to reserve lands on Christian Island and was working toward her sobriety and her high school education. 

[122]                     Ms. Sharma’s story is tragic, but not unique. Colonialism continues to engender longstanding, pervasive and persistent evils for Canada’s Indigenous population, with roots as deep as its effects have been broad. And courts now recognize this in law. Today, courts “must take judicial notice of such matters as the history of colonialism, displacement, and residential schools and how that history continues to translate into lower educational attainment, lower incomes, higher unemployment, higher rates of substance abuse and suicide, and of course higher levels of incarceration for Aboriginal peoples” (R. v. Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433, at para. 60).

[123]                     Indigenous overincarceration has been a particularly acute and visible issue for some decades. Already a “notorious fact in Aboriginal communities by the 1970s”, report after report from the late 1980s onward chronicled the problem in ever more alarming detail (J. Rudin, “Aboriginal Over-representation and R. v. Gladue: Where We Were, Where We Are and Where We Might Be Going” (2008), 40 S.C.L.R. (2d) 687, at p. 687; see, in particular, M. Jackson, “Locking Up Natives in Canada” (1989), 23 U.B.C. L. Rev. 215; Public Inquiry into the Administration of Justice and Aboriginal People, Report of the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba, vol. 1, The Justice System and Aboriginal People (1991); Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, Bridging the Cultural Divide: A Report on Aboriginal People and Criminal Justice in Canada (1996); J. Rudin, Aboriginal Peoples and the Criminal Justice System (2005)). 

[124]                     And still things worsened. In the 1980s, with Aboriginal peoples representing only 2 percent of Canada’s population, Aboriginal offenders represented roughly 17 percent of its provincial and territorial custody population (R. v. Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, at para. 58, citing Jackson, at pp. 215-16), and 10 percent of its federal penitentiary population (J. V. Roberts and R. Melchers, “The Incarceration of Aboriginal Offenders: Trends from 1978 to 2001” (2003), 45 C.J.C.C.J. 211, at p. 220). Yet by 2018‑19, Indigenous persons, representing only 4.5 percent of Canada’s adult population, had come to represent 31 percent of its admissions to provincial and territorial custody, and 29 percent of its admissions to federal custody (Statistics Canada, Adult and youth correctional statistics in Canada, 2018/2019 (December 2020), at p. 5). In Manitoba and Saskatchewan, the provinces with the highest relative Indigenous adult populations, admissions reached 75 percent (p. 5). Incredibly, Canada’s Indigenous inmate population grew by nearly 43 percent between 2009 and 2018 even as the sirens of overrepresentation continued to sound ever louder (Office of the Correctional Investigator of Canada (OCI), Annual Report 2017-2018 (2018), at p. 61).

[125]                     Striking as they are, those figures understate the incarceration rates of Indigenous women. Accounting for only about 4 percent of the female population, Indigenous women now comprise 42 percent of federally incarcerated women, with their population in federal institutions having increased by an astounding 73.8 percent over the past decade (OCI, Annual Report 2020-2021 (2021), at p. 41).

[126]                     Inside prisons, Indigenous offenders also experience some of incarceration’s harshest effects. They are more likely than their peers to “receive higher security classifications, to spend more time in segregation, to serve more of their sentence behind bars before first release, to be under-represented in community supervision populations, and to return to prison on revocation of parole” (Ewert, at para. 60).

[127]                     As with incarceration rates themselves, those harms are further pronounced for Indigenous women (National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, Reclaiming Power and Place: The Final Report, vol. 1a (2019), at p. 635; I.F., Queen’s Prison Law Clinic, at para. 7), over 70 percent of whom in federal custody are also mothers to underage children (OCI, Annual Report 2014-2015 (2015), at p. 50). Those mothers are most often young, single, and the sole supporting parent (K. Miller, “Canada’s Mother-Child Program and Incarcerated Aboriginal Mothers: How and Why the Program is Inaccessible to Aboriginal Female Offenders” (2018), 37 C.F.L.Q. 1, at p. 7).

[128]                     The dislocations that the statistics imply — the lost jobs, the separated families, the cultural alienations, the broken societies — are harder to quantify, but no less grave. Noting that an Indigenous boy born in Saskatchewan in 1960 had a 70 percent chance of being incarcerated by the age of 25, Professor Jackson wrote in 1988 that prison had “become for many young native people the contemporary equivalent of what the Indian residential school represented for their parents” (p. 216). Many years later, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada echoed those comments in its 2015 Final Report, where it compared the experience of Indigenous offenders in prison to the experiences of Indigenous children in residential schools:

Prison today is for many Aboriginal people what residential schools used to be: an isolating experience that removes Aboriginal people from their families and communities. They are violent places and often result in greater criminal involvement as some Aboriginal inmates, particularly younger ones, seek gang membership as a form of protection. Today’s prisons may not institutionally disparage Aboriginal cultures and languages as aggressively as residential schools did, but racism in prisons is a significant issue. In addition, prisons can fail to provide cultural safety for Aboriginal inmates through neglect or marginalization. Many damaged people emerged from the residential schools; there is no reason to believe that the same is not true of today’s prisons.

 

(Sentencing reasons, at para. 123, citing Truth and Reconciliation Commission, at p. 219.)

Among its 94 “calls to action”, the Commission called for “eliminating the overrepresentation of Aboriginal people in custody”, and in particular that of Aboriginal youths, over the ensuing decade (Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Calls to Action (2015), calls 30 and 38). With the close of that decade nearing, those calls are more urgent than ever.

[129]                     Efforts to remedy the problem, however, are nothing new. In the 1980s, as overrepresentation became harder to ignore, it dovetailed with Parliamentary attention to sentencing reform (D. Daubney and G. Parry, “An Overview of Bill C-41 (The Sentencing Reform Act)”, in J. V. Roberts and D. P. Cole, eds., Making Sense of Sentencing (1999), 31, at pp. 31-33). Then in 1995, following preparatory work of several years, Parliament enacted Bill C-41, or the Act to amend the Criminal Code (sentencing) and other Acts in consequence thereof, S.C. 1995, c. 22. The law, which came into force the following year, created Part XXIII of the Criminal Code, marking the “first codification and significant reform of sentencing principles in the history of Canadian criminal law” (Gladue, at para. 39).

[130]                     Among other things, Bill C-41 introduced two key measures for addressing overrepresentation. Section 718.2(e) directed sentencing judges to consider “all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances . . . with particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders”. And, s. 742.1 created conditional sentences — expanding the “available sanctions” — which allowed offenders to serve their sentence in their community, under strict conditions, rather than in prison. Speaking in Parliamentary debates, Minister of Justice Allan Rock explained that the former was an effort, “particularly having regard to the initiatives in the aboriginal communities to achieve community justice, . . . to encourage courts to look at alternatives where it’s consistent with the protection of the public — alternatives to jail — and not simply resort to that easy answer in every case” (Gladue, at para. 47 (emphasis deleted)).

[131]                       The regime first came before the Court in 1998, in Gladue. The accused, a 19-year old Cree mother, had pleaded guilty to manslaughter after stabbing her common law husband to death. Except for her Cree ancestry, and the fact that she resided off-reserve in McLennan, Alberta, almost nothing was said about her Indigenous identity at sentencing. Finding that s. 718.2(e) did not apply since she lived off‑reserve, the judge sentenced her to three years’ imprisonment. A majority of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia dismissed the appeal, concluding that while not applying s. 718.2(e) was an error, it was immaterial, since nothing in Ms. Gladue’s background would have made a difference in her sentence. Ms. Gladue then appealed to this Court.

[132]                       The question was how to interpret s. 718.2(e). Had it changed the law, introducing a new approach to sentencing Indigenous offenders?

[133]                       This Court held that s. 718.2(e) had changed the law: the provision directed judges “to undertake the process of sentencing aboriginal offenders differently” (para. 33), not because they deserve “more” attention in sentencing, but because their “circumstances are unique, and different from those of non-aboriginal offenders” (para. 37 (emphasis in original)). The reference to Aboriginal offenders, it explained, “suggests that there is something different about aboriginal offenders which may specifically make imprisonment a less appropriate or less useful sanction” (para. 37).

[134]                     Those differences were, broadly speaking, two-fold. First, Indigenous offenders often confront “unique systemic or background factors”: the “low incomes, high unemployment, lack of opportunities and options, lack or irrelevance of education, substance abuse, loneliness, and community fragmentation”, rooted in years of dislocation, that contribute to their higher incidence of crime and incarceration (paras. 66-67). Second, an offender’s Indigenous heritage may inform the “types of sentencing procedures and sanctions which may be appropriate in the circumstances” (para. 66), since Indigenous concepts of sentencing, although “vary[ing] widely”, often place greater emphasis upon restorative justice and “the importance of community-based sanctions” than does the general law of sentencing (paras. 73-74).

[135]                     Section 718.2(e) directed sentencing judges to consider and give effect to both factors, using the tools created in Bill C-41. Conditional sentences in particular, gave “an entirely new meaning” to the remedial purpose of s. 718.2(e), by expanding the range of available alternatives to imprisonment (para. 40). Attention was owed “to the fact that Part XXIII, through ss. 718, 718.2(e), and 742.1, among other provisions, ha[d] placed a new emphasis upon decreasing the use of incarceration” (para. 93(4.)).

[136]                     This was key if sentencing judges were to address, however modestly, the systemic injustices against Indigenous peoples in the criminal justice system:

What can and must be addressed . . . is the limited role that sentencing judges will play in remedying injustice against aboriginal peoples in Canada. Sentencing judges are among those decision-makers who have the power to influence the treatment of aboriginal offenders in the justice system. They determine most directly whether an aboriginal offender will go to jail, or whether other sentencing options may be employed which will play perhaps a stronger role in restoring a sense of balance to the offender, victim, and community, and in preventing future crime. [para. 65]

In all cases involving Indigenous offenders, then, sentencing judges had to consider their unique circumstances, taking judicial notice “of the systemic or background factors and the approach to sentencing which is relevant” to them (at para. 83), and integrating those concerns into fit sentences.

[137]                       Gladue seemed to herald a turning point in the sentencing of Indigenous offenders. Still, the Court worried that s. 718.2(e) “might come to be interpreted and applied in a manner which would have no real effect upon the day-to-day practice of sentencing aboriginal offenders in Canada” (para. 34). And indeed, by 2012, with overrepresentation again on the rise, the Court in Ipeelee saw that courts had “significantly curtailed the scope and potential remedial impact” of s. 718.2(e), “thwarting what was originally envisioned by Gladue” (para. 80).

[138]                       In Ipeelee, this Court redoubled its earlier guidance. It emphasized that, as “a remedial provision designed to ameliorate the serious problem of overrepresentation of Aboriginal people in Canadian prisons”, s. 718.2(e) “calls upon judges to use a different method of analysis in determining a fit sentence for Aboriginal offenders”, taking account of their unique systemic or background factors and culturally appropriate sentences (para. 59). It reiterated that courts “must take judicial notice” of colonialism’s ongoing effects (at para. 60), with which overrepresentation is “intimately tied” (para. 77). It clarified that courts should not require Indigenous offenders to show a “causal link between background factors and the commission of the current offence” before applying s. 718.2(e), a link that would be “extremely difficult” to establish (paras. 81 and 83). And it cautioned against diluting s. 718.2(e)’s effect in “serious or violent offences” (para. 84), a carve-out that would “deprive s. 718.2(e) of much of its remedial power” (para. 86). Rather, judges must consider the unique circumstances of Aboriginal offenders in all cases; failing to do so would not only contravene s. 718.2(e), but would “result in a sentence that was not fit and was not consistent with the fundamental principle of proportionality” (para. 87).

[139]                       The conditional sentence framework, meanwhile, had undergone some shifts. When first introduced in 1996, conditional sentences were made available whenever the offence carried no mandatory minimum, the appropriate jail term would have been less than two years, and when the offender would not “endanger the safety of the community” (Bill C‑41, s. 6). Amendments in 1997 then specified that conditional sentences had to be “consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2” (Criminal Law Improvement Act, 1996, S.C. 1997, c. 18, s. 107.1). Then in 2007, further amendments made conditional sentences unavailable for “serious personal injury offence[s] as defined in section 752”, and for terrorism or criminal organization offences, prosecuted by way of indictment, for which the maximum sentence was at least 10 years imprisonment (An Act to amend the Criminal Code (conditional sentence of imprisonment), S.C. 2007, c. 12, s. 1).

[140]                       In 2012, the same year Ipeelee was decided, Parliament again reframed conditional sentences in the Safe Streets and Communities Act, S.C. 2012, c. 1 (SSCA). The SSCA removed the reference to “serious personal injury offences” and provided that conditional sentences would be unavailable, among other things, for offences punishable by up to 14 years’ or life imprisonment (s. 742.1(c)); and certain drug offences punishable by up to 10 years’ imprisonment (s. 742.1(e)(ii)):

742.1 If a person is convicted of an offence and the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years, the court may, for the purpose of supervising the offender’s behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community, subject to the conditions imposed under section 742.3, if

 

. . .

 

(c) the offence is not an offence, prosecuted by way of indictment, for which the maximum term of imprisonment is 14 years or life;

 

. . .

 

(e) the offence is not an offence, prosecuted by way of indictment, for which the maximum term of imprisonment is 10 years, that

 

. . .

 

(ii) involved the import, export, trafficking or production of drugs . . .

[141]                       When Ms. Sharma was sentenced six years later, s. 742.1(c) precluded her — otherwise a “prime candidate for a conditional sentence” (C.A. reasons, at para. 88) — from serving her sentence in her community.

[142]                     In 1999, this Court called the situation a “crisis in the Canadian criminal justice system” (Gladue, at para. 64). Thirteen years later, citing Professor Rudin, it asked: “If Aboriginal overrepresentation was a crisis in 1999, what term can be applied to the situation today?” (Ipeelee, at para. 62, citing J. Rudin, “Addressing Aboriginal Overrepresentation Post‑Gladue: A Realistic Assessment of How Social Change Occurs” (2009), 54 Crim. L.Q. 447, at p. 452). Words failed then, and they fail now. The time for mere concern has long since passed. Put simply: we must do better.

III.         Procedural History

A.           Ontario Superior Court of Justice, 2018 ONSC 1141, 405 C.R.R. (2d) 119 (Hill J.)

[143]                     Hill J. concluded that the mandatory minimum sentence that Ms. Sharma would otherwise have served under s. 6(3)(a.1) of the CDSA infringed s. 12 of the Charter and could not be saved under s. 1. But he dismissed the argument that s. 742.1(c) infringed s. 15(1), finding the court had “no statistical information” that would assist in “identifying the real measure and likely or established impact of such an adverse effect, such as it may be, to determine whether it can qualify as a ‘distinction’ based upon Aboriginal status” (para. 257). He sentenced Ms. Sharma to 18 months’ imprisonment.

B.            Court of Appeal for Ontario, 2020 ONCA 478, 152 O.R. (3d) 209 (Feldman and Gillese JJ.A., Miller J.A. Dissenting)

[144]                     Ms. Sharma added s. 742.1(e)(ii) to her constitutional challenge on appeal with the Crown’s consent. She also renewed her argument on s. 7 of the Charter, which she had abandoned at first instance. The Crown did not appeal the finding that the minimum sentence under s. 6(3)(a.1) was unconstitutional.

[145]                     Feldman J.A., writing for the majority, concluded that ss. 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii) infringed ss. 7 and 15(1) of the Charter and could not be saved by s. 1.

[146]                     On s. 7, Ms. Sharma’s liberty was clearly deprived; the issue was whether the provisions were arbitrary or overbroad. The purpose of those provisions was to “maintain the integrity of the justice system by ensuring that offenders who commit serious offences receive prison sentences” (para. 148). The provisions were not arbitrary because removing conditional sentences coincided with Parliament’s purpose. But they were overbroad because “using a high maximum sentence as a proxy for the seriousness of the offence” (para. 154) caught some offenders the provisions “were not intended to capture” (para. 161): namely, those whose offences, while susceptible to stiff sentences, were less serious in the circumstances.

[147]                     On s. 15(1), the majority explained that conditional sentences “take on a unique significance in the context of Aboriginal offenders” as a remedy for “systemic overincarceration” (para. 70). By limiting that tool, the provisions undermined “the purpose and remedial effect of s. 718.2(e) in addressing the substantive inequality between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people” in Canada’s prison system (para. 79). This created a distinction on the basis of race and had the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating Ms. Sharma’s disadvantages as an Indigenous person. The sentencing judge erred in requiring further material evidence, since the judge was entitled to take judicial notice of the “historic disadvantage endured by Aboriginal people in Canada” (para. 90) and “the fact that systemic discrimination is recognized as a direct cause” of their overrepresentation in the criminal justice system (para. 102).

[148]                     The majority concluded that the provisions could not be saved under s. 1 and declared them of no force and effect. 

[149]                     Miller J.A., in dissent, would have dismissed the appeal. The provisions did not infringe ss. 7 or 15. Their purpose was to “ensure that offenders who commit serious crimes receive fit sentences, deemed to include a period of incarceration” (para. 283). They are not overbroad because it is for Parliament, not courts, to decide what constitutes a serious crime. And although the provisions drew a distinction based on race, Parliament did not treat Indigenous offenders as less equal than other offenders, so the distinction was not discriminatory. Had the provisions infringed s. 15(1), he would have upheld them under s. 1.

IV.         Discussion

[150]                     Two Charter rights — ss. 7 and 15(1) — frame this appeal. Each engages distinct analyses. I consider them in turn.

A.           Section 7

[151]                     The first issue is whether ss. 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii) infringe s. 7 of the Charter, which provides that “[e]veryone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.” Incarceration would deprive Ms. Sharma of her liberty. The question, therefore, is whether the deprivation conforms to the principles of fundamental justice. Two principles are relevant in this case: overbreadth and arbitrariness. Since I conclude that the impugned provisions are overbroad, it is unnecessary to address whether the law is arbitrary.

(1)         Overbreadth

[152]                     It is a principle of fundamental justice that a law that deprives a person of life, liberty or security must not be overbroad. Overbreadth concerns situations “where there is no rational connection between the purposes of the law and some, but not all, of its impacts” (Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, 2013 SCC 72, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1101, at para. 112 (emphasis deleted)). In other words, an overbroad law is “arbitrary in part” (para. 112 (emphasis deleted)).

[153]                     The analysis requires identifying the purpose and the scope of the law to determine whether it “goes too far by sweeping conduct into its ambit that bears no relation to its objective” (Bedford, at para. 117). I discuss each below.

(2)         Purpose

[154]                     The first step is to determine the purpose of the challenged provisions. The purpose’s framing should “focus on the ends of the legislation rather than on its means, be at an appropriate level of generality and capture the main thrust of the law in precise and succinct terms” (R. v. Moriarity, 2015 SCC 55, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 485, at para. 26). This requires some discernment, since a purpose articulated in “too general terms . . . will provide no meaningful check on the means employed to achieve it: almost any challenged provision will likely be rationally connected to a very broadly stated purpose” (para. 28).

[155]                     The parties disagree on the appropriate statement of legislative purpose: the Crown advances the one adopted by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in R. v. Neary, 2017 SKCA 29, [2017] 7 W.W.R. 730, while Ms. Sharma advances the one adopted by the majority in the court below, with which the dissenting justice substantially agreed (paras. 148 and 282).

[156]                     In Neary, the court concluded that the SSCA reflected “at least the following broad purposes: (a) providing consistency and clarity to the sentencing regime; (b) promoting of public safety and security; (c) establishing paramountcy of the secondary principles of denunciation and deterrence in sentencing for the identified offences; and (d) treating of non-violent serious offences as serious offences for sentencing purposes” (para. 35). But in my view, these sub-purposes improperly focus on the broad objectives underlying the legislation as a whole, rather than the specific provisions at issue, and so cannot ground an overbreadth analysis in this case (R. v. Safarzadeh-Markhali, 2016 SCC 14, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 180, at para. 30). 

[157]                     Nor can I entirely adopt the purpose statement of the court below, being “to maintain the integrity of the justice system by ensuring that offenders who commit serious offences receive prison sentences” (C.A. reasons, at para. 148). Just as “providing consistency and clarity to the sentencing regime” and “promoting of public safety and security” are too general, so too is “maintain[ing] the integrity of the justice system”. In my view, it is better characterized as an “animating social value” (Moriarity, at para. 28).

[158]                     What, then, is the purpose of the impugned provisions? Discerning the purpose requires this Court to consider the stated objective in the legislation, if any; the text, context and scheme of the legislation; and extrinsic evidence such as legislative history and evolution (Moriarity, at para. 31).

[159]                     The amendment to s. 742.1 was one of a series of measures set out in the SSCA, which amended several acts, including the CDSA, the Criminal Code, the State Immunity Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. S-18, the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, S.C. 1992, c. 20, the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1, and the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27. The bill’s overall direction was to “move quickly to reintroduce comprehensive law-and-order legislation to combat crime and terrorism” (House of Commons Debates, vol. 146, No. 2, 1st Sess., 41st Parl., June 3, 2011, at pp. 15-19). As a result, Canada’s sentencing regime adopted sterner and more predictable sanctions: for example, it introduced mandatory minimum imprisonment sentences for drug and sexual offences and it stiffened sentences for violent youth crimes.

[160]                     The amendments to s. 742.1 in particular aimed to remove community sentences for offenders who commit more serious offences. The Minister of Justice stressed that the sentencing reforms would “prevent the use of conditional sentences for serious violent and property crimes” (House of Commons Debates, vol. 146, No. 17, 1st Sess., 41st Parl., September 21, 2011, at pp. 1298-99; see also House of Commons Debates, June 3, 2011, at pp. 15-19; C.A. reasons, at paras. 146-47). For the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice, the government was “addressing the concerns of Canadians who no longer want to see conditional sentences used for serious crimes, whether they are violent crimes or property crimes” (House of Commons Debates, September 21, 2011, at pp. 1316-18). This concern explains why Parliament narrowed the ambit of eligibility for conditional sentences.

[161]                     In my view, Parliament’s purpose in enacting ss. 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii) was to ensure offenders who commit more serious offences serve prison time. To this extent, I agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal. This purpose strikes the appropriate balance between precision and generality, without conflating the means with the ends, nor amounting to a “virtual repetition of the challenged provision, divorced from its context” (Moriarity, at para. 28).

(3)         Effects

[162]                     The second step asks whether the law goes further than reasonably necessary to achieve its legislative goals (Safarzadeh-Markhali, at para. 50). The ultimate question is whether the law violates basic norms because there is no connection between its purpose and an effect (Bedford, at para. 119). An overbroad effect on even one person is sufficient to establish a breach of s. 7 (Bedford, at para. 123; Carter v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 5, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 331, at para. 85). Whether the extent of such effects is justifiable is a question for s. 1.

[163]                     In seeking to ensure that offenders who commit more serious offences serve prison time, Parliament used maximum sentences as the gauge of the seriousness of an offence. Both provisions thus precluded conditional sentences for offences where the maximum sentence is 14 years or life (s. 742.1(c)), or 10 years, in offences involving the import, export, trafficking or production of drugs (s. 742.1(e)(ii)).

[164]                     But maximum sentences only show that an offence is potentially serious, not that it is necessarily serious. While the nature of the designated offences are serious in the abstract, the range of conduct they cover can be less serious. Worst-case scenarios say nothing about baseline cases. I agree with the majority in the Court of Appeal below that maximum sentences are a flawed proxy for the gravity of offences which can be committed in circumstances ranging in severity, from the relatively more serious to the relatively less serious.

[165]                     Consider the designated offences: they are wide-ranging and lack a uniform or coherent view of the seriousness of any given infraction. The offences caught by s. 742.1(c), for instance, range from offences like manslaughter (s. 236) or dangerous operation of a conveyance causing death (ss. 320.13(3) and 320.21), to offences like forging a passport (s. 57(1)) or possession of counterfeit money (s. 450(b)).

[166]                     As is typical, many of those offences “cover a wide range of conduct and may attract a broad range of sentences” (R. v. Parranto, 2021 SCC 46, at para. 53). The scope of manslaughter, for example, runs from “near accident” to “near murder” (R. v. Laberge (1995), 1995 ABCA 196 (CanLII), 165 A.R. 375 (C.A.), at para. 6; see also R. v. Morrisey, 2000 SCC 39, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 90, at para. 72, per Arbour J.). It presents “the widest possible range for sentencing among all the offences in the Criminal Code”, such that life imprisonment and a suspended sentence may each be appropriate in different contexts (R. v. Sinclair (1980), 1980 CanLII 3097 (MB CA), 3 Man. R. (2d) 257 (C.A.), at para. 2). This variety has led appellate courts to identify different categories of severity within a given offence for sentencing purposes (see Parranto, at paras. 53 and 56-57).  

[167]                     Section 742.1(e)(ii), too, covers a range of conduct. It neither distinguishes the type of drug trafficked nor the quantum, encompassing large-scale commercial schemes and small-scale imports for personal use. In the words of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, it spans the gulf, in terms of relative seriousness, between a person who “imports 30kg of fentanyl to distribute to addicts across the country” and one “who brings a quarter of an ounce of cocaine into Canada to use at a party” (I.F., at para. 16).

[168]                     Maximum penalties of any kind will furthermore “by [their] very nature be imposed only rarely” (R. v. Cheddesingh, 2004 SCC 16, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 433, at para. 1; see also R. v. L.M., 2008 SCC 31, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163, at para. 20). They are reserved for crimes of sufficient gravity and blameworthiness. The break and enter offence under s. 348(1) of the Criminal Code, for instance, is punishable by life imprisonment if committed in a dwelling-house, and by up to 10 years in prison if committed elsewhere. But before the challenged provisions were enacted, the average sentence imposed on most offenders was less than one year in custody, if they were sentenced to prison at all (D. Plecas et al., Do Judges Take Prior Record into Consideration? An Analysis of the Sentencing of Repeat Offenders in British Columbia (2012), at p. 7).

[169]                     Granted, this Court has said that maximum sentences not only “help determine the gravity of the offence”, but are “one of Parliament’s principal tools” to do so (R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, at paras. 95-96). Indeed, maximum sentences provide general guidance on the gravity of an offence, and can assist in setting sentencing ranges. But that general guidance only goes so far in individual cases. A fit sentence is always defined by the totality of circumstances. The question is always: for “this offence, committed by this offender, harming this victim, in this community, what is the appropriate sanction under the Criminal Code?” (Gladue, at para. 80 (emphasis in original)). For that reason, “the structure of maximum penalties under the Code frequently provides little guidance to sentencing judges in imposing punishments in individual cases” (R. v. M. (C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 36).

[170]                     Constitutionally valid mandatory minimums are different because they set a floor, not a ceiling: the offences they attach to are so serious that the minimum is appropriate even for a highly sympathetic offender in highly mitigating circumstances. For instance, a mandatory life sentence without parole eligibility for 25 years — the minimum punishment for first degree murder committed in the course of a crime of domination (Criminal Code, s. 231(5)) — was found to respect s. 7 because the corresponding offence is so inherently vile that the sentence will always be proportionate (R. v. Luxton, 1990 CanLII 83 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 711, at pp. 721-23). The offences captured in ss. 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii) lack a similar baseline. 

[171]                     The Crown, however, says that Parliament’s approach is constitutionally permissible for three reasons.

[172]                     First, the Crown argues that gauging seriousness through maximum sentences is far from novel. Parliament has used maximum sentences elsewhere to determine the objective gravity of an offence, for instance in absolute or conditional discharges, which s. 730(1) deems unavailable for offences punishable by 14 years or life. The constitutionality of such provisions — including s. 730(1) — is not before this Court. But the present situation is also unique. Most obviously, as Ms. Sharma points out, the restrictions on conditional sentences imposed by the challenged provisions are the only type of legislative measure that restricts a person’s physical liberty based solely on the potential maximum sentence. And here, as I have explained, a maximum sentence fails to track the gravity of every offence; it does not provide a rational basis to imprison every accused it applies to.

[173]                     Second, the Crown suggests that judicial discretion will prevent any unduly broad impact: other sentencing alternatives will ensure that offenders undeserving of prison time will avoid time behind bars. As the Canadian Civil Liberties Association pointed out, this argument only further highlights the provisions’ vast reach in capturing offences at the lowest level of seriousness. Conduct nearly warranting a suspended sentence is far removed from conduct warranting a maximum sentence. But more importantly, the most relevant of these alternatives — intermittent sentences or suspended sentences — will not always be available or proportionate; they offer only a very limited safeguard.

[174]                     Intermittent sentences cannot exceed 90 days (s. 732(1)), and may thus fail to be proportionate for an offender who would otherwise receive a longer sentence of house arrest. Nor can every offender spend their weekends in jail; as the Legal Services Board of Nunavut suggests, intermittent sentences may be effectively unavailable for some Indigenous offenders in remote communities where frequent travel is unworkable (I.F., at paras. 13-15; see also R. v. Turtle, 2020 ONCJ 429, 467 C.R.R. (2d) 153). 

[175]                     And suspended sentences serve different purposes from conditional sentences. Conditional sentences target “offenders who would otherwise be in jail but who could be in the community under tight controls” (R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, at para. 36 (emphasis deleted)). They are designed to “permit the accused to avoid imprisonment but not to avoid punishment”, and can achieve the objectives of general deterrence and denunciation (paras. 35 and 127(8.)). Suspended sentences, by contrast, are primarily a rehabilitative sentencing tool, and so are less well‑suited when deterrence and denunciation are paramount (para. 23). There are “strong indications that Parliament intended the conditional sentence to be more punitive than probation” (paras. 28 and 55).

[176]                     Finally, the Crown suggests that a finding of overbreadth would improperly substitute the Court’s own view of the seriousness of an offence for Parliament’s, trespassing on the latter’s policy choices. Similarly, my colleagues Justices Brown and Rowe suggest that, absent a precise definition, Parliament’s definition of serious offences is owed deference — like other policy choices, it is a “judgment cal[l]” that “rests not with the preferences of judges, but with those collectively expressed by Parliament as representatives of the electorate” (para. 107).

[177]                     But the s. 7 analysis cannot simply defer to Parliament’s choices about crime and punishment. All legislation reflects judgment calls, and some uses terms not subject to precise definition; yet neither implies that the legislation is any more likely to respect the Charter. There is nothing novel, unwieldy, or unsound about subjecting sentencing law to constitutional scrutiny. Indeed, it is a court’s role to ensure that legislation complies with the Charter.

[178]                     My colleagues raise one further point. The Court of Appeal, they say, “collapsed the concept of seriousness of the offence into the concepts of circumstances of the offender and particulars of the crime” (para. 108). While I agree that the offender’s personal circumstances are conceptually distinct from the gravity of the offence itself, the seriousness of an offence depends on the circumstances that surround its commission (Friesen, at para. 96). As I have explained, the permutations of an offence can be many and varied.

[179]                     In my view, therefore, the provisions exceed their purpose in applying to offences committed at the lowest range of severity. The provisions have some effects that bear no relation to their aim. They are overbroad.

(4)         Conclusion

[180]                     Sections 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii) target more serious offences through the proxy of maximum sentences, yet they capture conduct for which the maximum sentence would far overshoot the offence’s gravity. The provisions treat Ms. Sharma’s circumstances on par with a sophisticated and large-scale narcotics importation scheme. This impact bears no connection to the provisions’ purpose. I conclude that the challenged provisions are overbroad and constitute a prima facie infringement of s. 7 of the Charter.

B.            Section 15(1)

[181]                     In 1996, Parliament sought to reduce the high rate of Indigenous incarceration in two key ways: by enacting the principle of restraint in s. 718.2(e), which states that “all available sanctions other than imprisonment . . . should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders” (Bill C‑41, s. 6); and by introducing the conditional sentence of imprisonment in s. 742.1, which provided an alternative to imprisonment by permitting offenders to serve jail time in the community (Roberts and Melchers, at p. 216).

[182]                     Before 2012, those provisions offered an Indigenous offender in Ms. Sharma’s shoes the chance to serve their sentence in their community, so long as it represented a reasonable alternative to imprisonment. After the SSCA’s enactment in 2012, however, that same offender became destined for prison unless their offence was so minor as to warrant a lesser non-custodial sentence. This was so regardless of whether background or systemic factors lay behind their criminality, whether those factors made incarceration especially unsuitable, or whether culturally appropriate conditions in the community would better safeguard their links to their heritage.

[183]                     In restricting the availability of conditional sentences, ss. 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii) thus denied sentencing judges the principal tool for keeping many Indigenous offenders out of prison, in the face of an ongoing legal directive to seek alternatives, and at a time when the word “crisis” failed to capture the enormity of Indigenous overrepresentation in Canada’s prisons (Ipeelee, at para. 62). Do the provisions thereby violate the equality guarantee under s. 15(1) of the Charter on the basis of race?

[184]                     The answer, in my view, is yes. I agree with Feldman and Gillese JJ.A. in the decision below that the provisions discriminate by impairing an ameliorative measure that was designed to specifically affect Indigenous offenders.

[185]                     I turn to the legal framework for discrimination claims under s. 15(1) of the Charter before considering its application to this case.

(1)         Legal Framework

[186]                     Section 15(1) of the Charter provides that “[e]very individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.” Like other Charter rights, it must be read broadly and purposively (Hunter v. Southam Inc., 1984 CanLII 33 (SCC), [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at pp. 155-56). Its purpose is to ensure “equality in the formulation and application of the law”, for “the promotion of a society in which all are secure in the knowledge that they are recognized at law as human beings equally deserving of concern, respect and consideration” (Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia, 1989 CanLII 2 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 143, at p. 171).

[187]                     The touchstone of that commitment is substantive equality. A narrow reading of s. 15(1) might have secured individuals against formal discrimination in the law’s content or application, but ignored how facially neutral laws, faithfully applied, can produce discriminatory outcomes in practice. Instead, the Court has steadfastly held that laws may discriminate in their effect or application no less than in their letter. Against mere formalism, substantive equality looks “behind the facade of similarities and differences” to the “actual impact of the impugned law, taking full account of social, political, economic and historical factors concerning the group” (Withler v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 12, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 396, at para. 39).

[188]                     The test reflects this outlook. To succeed under s. 15(1), a claimant must show that the law or state action: (1) on its face or in its impact, creates a distinction based on enumerated or analogous grounds; and (2) imposes burdens or denies a benefit in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating disadvantage (Fraser v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 SCC 28, at para. 27).

[189]                     The test’s evidentiary requirements vary with the context. When a law creates a facial distinction, the test can be satisfied by reading the relevant text. But claimants in “adverse impact” cases will generally “have more work to do” (Withler, at para. 64). Their task is to show that “although the law purports to treat everyone the same, it has a disproportionately negative impact on a group or individual that can be identified by factors relating to enumerated or analogous grounds” (para. 64).

[190]                     The first step is “not a preliminary merits screen, nor an onerous hurdle designed to weed out claims on technical bases” (Quebec (Attorney General) v. Alliance du personnel professionnel et technique de la santé et des services sociaux, 2018 SCC 17, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 464, at para. 26); it is “aimed at ensuring that those who access the protection of s. 15(1) are those it is designed to protect” (Ontario (Attorney General) v. G, 2020 SCC 38, at para. 41). While sometimes framed in different ways — for instance, as requiring a “disproportionate impact” on members of a protected group in adverse impact cases (Fraser, at para. 52) — the test makes clear that step one only requires a “distinction based on a protected ground” (para. 50). This standard is designed “to exclude claims that have ‘nothing to do with substantive equality’” (Alliance, at para. 26); not to impose scientific rigour or import elements of justification properly left to s. 1.

[191]                     In some cases, a distinction will be “apparent and immediate” (Kahkewistahaw First Nation v. Taypotat, 2015 SCC 30, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 548, at para. 33; Fraser, at para. 61). A lack of sign language interpretation for public health care services, for instance, is an evident barrier for those with hearing impairments (Eldridge v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 1997 CanLII 327 (SCC), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 624). In other cases, where the connection is less clear, the distinction will require further proof. 

[192]                     Although a distinction “can be proven in different ways”, evidence of the “situation of the claimant group” and the “physical, social, cultural or other barriers” they face, and evidence “about the outcomes that the impugned law or policy . . . has produced in practice” are particularly helpful (Fraser, at paras. 55-59). Ideally, adverse impact claims should be supported by both, since alone the former may amount to a mere “web of instinct”, while solely relying on statistical disparity to support the latter may “leave open the possibility of unreliable results” (para. 60). But this is “not to say . . . that both kinds of evidence are always required” (para. 61). And while evidence of “statistical disparity and of broader group disadvantage” may assist, neither is mandatory and their significance can vary (para. 67).

[193]                     The second step considers the impact of the distinction, asking “whether the law has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating disadvantage” (Fraser, at para. 76). While there is no rigid template, such impacts may include “[e]conomic exclusion or disadvantage, [s]ocial exclusion . . . [p]sychological harms . . . [p]hysical harms . . . [or] [p]olitical exclusion”, and must be “viewed in light of any systemic or historical disadvantages faced by the claimant group” (para. 76, citing C. Sheppard, Inclusive Equality: The Relational Dimensions of Systemic Discrimination in Canada (2010), at pp. 62-63). Claimants may, but need not, prove that the distinction is arbitrary or perpetuates prejudicial or stereotypical attitudes (paras. 78 and 80). And while a challenged law may satisfy step two by widening a group’s relative disadvantage, the term “perpetuate” indicates that a law may discriminate even if it does not aggravate that disadvantage. Care must be taken not to disregard how discrimination can result from “continuing to do things ‘the way they have always been done’” (F. Faraday, “One Step Forward, Two Steps Back? Substantive Equality, Systemic Discrimination and Pay Equity at the Supreme Court of Canada” (2020), 94 S.C.L.R. (2d) 301, at p. 310; see also J. Koshan, “Intersections and Roads Untravelled: Sex and Family Status in Fraser v Canada” (2021), 30:2 Const. Forum 29, at p. 31).

[194]                     While distinct, the two steps may overlap; the same facts that illustrate a distinction may also illustrate its discriminatory character (Law v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), 1999 CanLII 675 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497, at para. 85; Fraser, at para. 82). The same evidence may serve more than one analytical purpose.

[195]                     As elsewhere, courts may take judicial notice of social facts where appropriate, taking care “not to use judicial notice to recognize social phenomena that may not truly exist” (Quebec (Attorney General) v. A, 2013 SCC 5, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 61, at para. 154).

[196]                     Because substantive equality looks to real-world effects, the inquiry is always contextual. What matters is not the claimant group’s situation as compared to a similarly situated counterpart (Withler, at para. 60; Fraser, at para. 94), but the “claimant group’s situation and the actual impact of the law on that situation” (Withler, at para. 43, see also para. 40; R. v. Turpin, 1989 CanLII 98 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1296, at p. 1334; Law, at para. 30; Quebec v. A, at para. 51; Taypotat, at para. 18; Ontario v. G, at para. 43). The grounds of discrimination shaping that situation may intersect, compounding to form an individual or group’s experience (Withler, at para. 58). Indeed, in the context of systemic discrimination in the justice system, it is especially important to be alive to the intersectionality of disadvantage.

[197]                     The focus on the impact means the state’s intentions are not decisive — the state can discriminate without intending to. Nor is the absence of differential treatment decisive — discrimination may also arise from “the legislation’s failure to take into account the true characteristics of a disadvantaged person or group within Canadian society (i.e., by treating all persons in a formally identical manner)” (Law, at para. 36). In practice, true equality may sometimes demand differential treatment; only additional interpretive services, for instance, can ensure that those with hearing impairments have equal access to public health care. While some acts discriminate by giving certain groups or individuals a “leg up”, others discriminate by failing to do so. There is no single template.  

[198]                     Not every distinction is discriminatory, nor is every uniformity constitutionally sound. Identifying when a claim discloses discrimination requires rigorous analysis.

[199]                     It also requires balance. Section 15(1) has been described as the “broadest of all guarantees” (Andrews, at p. 185). The Court has been cautious to not exclude certain types of claims from s. 15(1)’s ambit pre-emptively, including the extent of any state obligations to take positive, remedial actions (Eldridge, at para. 73; Alliance, at para. 42). But much of the controversy in this case derives from the risk of defining the right too broadly, which, on some views, could undermine the separation of powers. For the Crown, the framework applied by the majority at the Court of Appeal could have the effect of constitutionalizing ordinary legislation, since it would restrict the state from amending or repealing its ameliorative measures (A.F., at paras. 60-61).

[200]                     In my view, this argument conflates form and effects. As under s. 7, Parliament’s choices are always subject to the Constitution, including its choices to amend or repeal legislation. Section 15(1) only “ensure[s] that whatever actions [the legislature] does take do not have a discriminatory impact” (Alliance, at para. 42 (emphasis in original)). If amendments or repeal create a distinction on enumerated or analogous grounds, and impose a burden or deny a benefit in a manner that reinforces, perpetuates, or exacerbates the group’s disadvantage, s. 15(1) requires courts to say so. The problem arises, in other words, “not because the statutory provisions themselves are constitutionally protected”, but “because their repeal or modification gives rise to unconstitutional effects” (R. v. Chouhan, 2021 SCC 26, at para. 145, per Rowe J., concurring). If no discrimination is present, s. 15(1) leaves legislatures a free hand. 

[201]                     Even where legislative amendments do produce discriminatory effects, the Charter — distinctively among rights-conferring instruments — invites the state to justify rights limitations under s. 1 (Andrews, at pp. 175‑78; Turpin, at p. 1330). Section 15(1) is not a complete code; it must “be read together” with s. 1 (Miron v. Trudel, 1995 CanLII 97 (SCC), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 418, at para. 141, per McLachlin J.). Only if the state fails to justify the limitation will the challenged law or state action be found unconstitutional.

[202]                     The fault line of the division between s. 15(1) and s. 1 is justification, which falls to the state. A fair burden on claimants, whose resources — financial or informational — are typically far lesser, is only to show that the impugned law or state action has a discriminatory impact on disadvantaged groups (Miron, at para. 139; Fraser, at para. 79). The state then bears the burden of justifying its policy choices and legislative goals. This reflects “the injunction to which this Court has adhered from the earliest Charter cases: courts should interpret the enumerated rights in a broad and generous fashion, leaving the task of narrowing the prima facie protection thus granted to conform to conflicting social and legislative interests to s. 1” (Miron, at para. 130).

[203]                     This Court’s longstanding approach, grounded in substantive equality and the division of burdens between the claimant and the state (see Law, at para. 88), safeguards much of s. 15(1)’s “powerful remedial purpose” (Ontario v. G, at para. 39). A broad and generous approach to s. 15(1) “permits evolution and adaptation of equality analysis over time in order to accommodate new or different understandings of equality as well as new issues raised by varying fact situations” (Law, at para. 3). It gives life to s. 15(1)’s constitutional directive to continually scrutinize the existing order of things to see how Canadian law shapes up. To the extent the state’s laws or acts are unjustified, equality may well unsettle the status quo. Section 15(1) demands nothing less.

[204]                     I would add this. The above framework is settled law. While changing in form over time, the current iteration has been affirmed five times in the last four years (Alliance, at para. 25; Centrale des syndicats du Québec v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2018 SCC 18, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 522, at para. 22; Fraser, at para. 27; Ontario v. G, at para. 40; R. v. C.P., 2021 SCC 19, at paras. 56 and 141). The roots of that framework extend much deeper in the case law. Yet under the guise of offering “clarity”, my colleagues seek to revise the test. In so doing, they resurrect their rejected arguments in Alliance and Fraser, lending credence to the concern that equality claimants must, “with each new case, stand ready to defend the exact gains that have been won multiple times in the past” (Fraser, at para. 135, citing Faraday, at p. 330). 

[205]                     My colleagues’ revisions permeate their reasons. Their thrust is to raise the bars at each step of the test: by renewing focus on causation (at paras. 42-49), which adds nothing to the existing framework and is reminiscent of rejected pre-Charter approaches (Bliss v. Attorney General of Canada, 1978 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1979] 1 S.C.R. 183); by eschewing the test’s language of “created a distinction” for the more ambiguous “created or contributed to a disproportionate impact” (paras. 3, 29, 31, 32(a), 35-36, 40-42, 45-50, 54, 66, 71, 73-74 and 76); by claiming that “[l]eaving the situation of a claimant group unaffected is insufficient to meet the step two requirements” (para. 52), potentially undermining the term “perpetuate” in step two of the test; by importing elements of state justification into step two, requiring courts to consider Parliament’s “policy choices” and legislative “goals” (paras. 57-61); by pre-emptively foreclosing the possibility of “general, positive obligation[s] on the state to remedy social inequalities or enact remedial legislation” (para. 63); by asserting, without support, that it is “[not] enough to show that the law restricts an ameliorative program” at step one (para. 71); and by diminishing the role of interveners (paras. 74-75), critiquing their use of social science and other legislative fact evidence that this Court has regularly relied upon (R. v. Spence, 2005 SCC 71, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 458, at para. 57, citing R. v. Lavallee, 1990 CanLII 95 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852; Moge v. Moge, 1992 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1992] 3 S.C.R. 813, at p. 853; R. v. Wells, 2000 SCC 10, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 207, at para. 53; Gladue, at para. 83; see also R. v. Le, 2019 SCC 34, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 692, at paras. 89-97).

[206]                     My colleagues’ revisions are not only unsolicited, unnecessary, and contrary to stare decisis; they would dislodge foundational premises of our equality jurisprudence. This is not “clarification”; it is wholesale revision.

(2)         Application

[207]                     In my view, Ms. Sharma has satisfied both stages of the s. 15(1) test. Simply put, ss. 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii) distinguish and reinforce, perpetuate, and exacerbate disadvantage on the basis of race because they impair an ameliorative measure that was designed to specifically benefit Indigenous offenders, who face pre-existing disadvantages in the Canadian justice system.

[208]                     I begin by addressing whether the provisions create a distinction on the basis of race, which requires examining the interrelated nature of conditional sentences and the Gladue framework under s. 718.2(e). I then turn to the second stage, and consider whether this distinction reinforces, perpetuates, or exacerbates disadvantage.

(a)           Distinction on the Basis of Race

[209]                     The first question is whether ss. 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii), on their face or in their impact, create a distinction based on enumerated or analogous grounds (Fraser, at para. 27). As an Indigenous person, it is uncontested that Ms. Sharma belongs to a protected group under s. 15(1). What is contested is whether the challenged provisions draw a distinction based on race. 

[210]                     The Crown submits that there is no race-based distinction; instead, Indigenous overrepresentation in prisons can be attributed to social circumstances that exist apart from the provisions at issue. Ms. Sharma replies that the provisions impair an accommodation — the remedial function of the Gladue framework — in a manner that differentially impacts Indigenous offenders.

[211]                     I agree with Ms. Sharma. Removing conditional sentences for some offences has a differential impact on Indigenous offenders because it prevents sentencing judges from fulfilling the Gladue framework’s substantive equality mandate. This distinction flows not, as the Crown suggests, from the mere existence of historical disadvantage, but from the combined effect of ss. 718.2(e) and 742.1.

[212]                     I consider the relationship between the two provisions before turning to how restrictions on conditional sentences imperil the remedial function of the Gladue framework, creating a race-based distinction.

(i)            The Relationship Between Sections 718.2(e) and 742.1, and the Gladue Framework

[213]                     As I have explained, s. 718.2(e) reflects Parliament’s attention to “the unique systemic and background factors affecting Indigenous peoples, as well as their fundamentally different cultural values and world views” (Ewert, at para. 58). In seeking to ameliorate Indigenous overrepresentation in Canadian prisons, and to encourage a restorative approach to sentencing (Gladue, at para. 93), s. 718.2(e) “call[ed] upon judges to use a different method of analysis in determining a fit sentence for Aboriginal offenders”, thereby “abandon[ing] the presumption that all offenders and all communities share the same values when it comes to sentencing and . . . recogniz[ing] that, given these fundamentally different world views, different or alternative sanctions may more effectively achieve the objectives of sentencing in a particular community” (Ipeelee, at paras. 59 and 74). A uniform approach having proved no barrier to overrepresentation, s. 718.2(e) aimed to bring substantive equality to sentencing.

[214]                     Practically speaking, this methodology — now commonly referred to as the Gladue framework — calls upon judges to undertake the process of sentencing Indigenous offenders differently. It requires them to pay special “attention to the unique background and systemic factors which may have played a part in bringing the particular offender before the courts”, and to approach the procedure and the sanction imposed “in accordance with the aboriginal perspective” (Gladue, at paras. 69 and 74). As the interveners representing Indigenous peoples highlighted, the many Indigenous approaches to sentencing often share common principles, including community healing, reconciliation and the reintegration of the offender (I.F., Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, at paras. 15-16; I.F., Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, at paras. 18-22; I.F., Native Women’s Association of Canada, at paras. 12 and 23; I.F., Legal Services Board of Nunavut, at paras. 10-12).

[215]                     Section 718.2(e) provided the substantive equality direction; conditional sentences provided a means of implementation. Conditional sentences “changed the range of available penal sanctions in a significant way” by “alter[ing] the sentencing landscape in a manner which gives an entirely new meaning to the principle that imprisonment should be resorted to only where no other sentencing option is reasonable in the circumstances” (Gladue, at para. 40). The provision creating them — s. 742.1 — suggested, “on its face, a desire to lessen the use of incarceration” (para. 40). And the “general principle expressed in s. 718.2(e) must be construed and applied in this light” (para. 40). 

[216]                     Indeed, the new approach to sentencing and the new non-custodial sanctions were, by design, intertwined: Parliament aimed to ensure that “jails [were] reserved for those who should be there”, which meant, “[w]hen appropriate, alternatives must be contemplated, especially in the case of Native offenders” (House of Commons Debates, vol. V, 1st Sess., 35th Parl., September 20, 1994, at pp. 5871 and 5873 (Hon. Allan Rock)).

[217]                     Since “it is often the case that imposing a custodial sentence on an aboriginal offender does not advance the remedial purpose of s. 718.2(e)” (Wells, at para. 39), conditional sentences offered an option that was “more effective than incarceration at achieving the restorative objectives of rehabilitation, reparations to the victim and community, and the promotion of a sense of responsibility in the offender” (Proulx, at para. 22). Yet conditional sentences remained punitive and were capable of achieving the objectives of deterrence and denunciation (para. 22).

[218]                     Conditional sentences benefitted a specific sector of Indigenous offenders: those for whom probation was too lenient, but prison too harsh, given their unique needs and circumstances. And they allowed courts to integrate Indigenous visions of justice into community-based sanctions. Together with s. 718.2(e), they provided an ameliorative measure for Indigenous peoples that was intended to facilitate the substantive equality mandate under s. 718.2(e) and reduce the overrepresentation of Indigenous offenders in prison.

[219]                     The Crown argues that s. 718.2(e)’s remedial purpose exists apart from conditional sentences; it only directs courts to consider “all available sanctions, other than imprisonment, that are reasonable in the circumstances”, and it is for Parliament to determine what sentences are “available” (A.F., at paras. 49-53 (emphasis deleted)). Section 718.2(e) does not “specifically ‘instruc[t] courts to consider whether to impose a conditional sentence’ in cases involving an Indigenous offender” (A.F., at para. 51).

[220]                     Sections 718.2(e) can undoubtedly be imagined without s. 742.1; indeed, s. 718.2(e) requires courts to “carefully conside[r]” the length of a prison term even where no alternatives to incarceration are available, such that an Indigenous offender’s jail term may be less than a non-Indigenous offender’s for the same offence (Gladue, at para. 93(8.) and (12.)). But if no reasonable alternatives to incarceration exist, then s. 718.2(e) can only give partial effect to recognizing Indigenous peoples’ unique backgrounds and perspectives in sentencing. Excluding conditional sentences from s. 718.2(e)’s ambit would, as this Court anticipated in Proulx, “greatly diminish the remedial purpose animating Parliament’s enactment of [s. 718.2(e)], which contemplates the greater use of conditional sentences and other alternatives to incarceration in cases of aboriginal offenders” (para. 92). In Ipeelee, likewise, the Court cautioned that carving out an exception in the Gladue framework for serious offences would “deprive s. 718.2(e) of much of its remedial power, given its focus on reducing overreliance on incarceration” (para. 86).

[221]                     Sections 718.2(e) and 742.1 are neither wholly independent nor forever inseparable, yet they each invariably shape the other. For that reason, they have long been conceptualized together, both by Parliament at the time of their enactment, and indeed by this Court in its Gladue jurisprudence.

[222]                     My colleagues recognize this link, but imply that “the specific provisions [Ms. Sharma] challenged” were relevant at step one (para. 73). But a focus on the specific provisions divorced from the broader context would truncate the legal test. It would be contrary to the longstanding directive that distinctions in adverse impact cases be understood in their full context (Withler, at para. 43), and indeed, to a recent precedent of this Court finding that a distinction arose from the interaction of two statutes (Ontario v. G). In a test directed to adverse effects, there is no reason to ignore some types of effects as irrelevant.

(ii)         Restrictions on Conditional Sentences Imperil the Remedial Function of the Gladue Framework

[223]                     By prohibiting the use of conditional sentences for many offences, the SSCA removed a sentencing option for all offenders. But for some Indigenous offenders, including Ms. Sharma, this undermined the specific accommodation offered by s. 718.2(e): that is, a different sentencing methodology that was animated by their unique needs and circumstances as Indigenous people. The amendments, in other words, more acutely affected Indigenous offenders than it did others, creating a differential impact on a group based on race. In this way, a distinction results from the law’s interaction with other legislative provisions or circumstances (Ontario v. G, at para. 51).

[224]                     The differential impact is apparent with respect to Ms. Sharma herself. Her background reflected, in the sentencing judge’s words, a “constellation of classic Gladue factors” (para. 266). As a first‑time offender with a low risk of reoffending, and single mother to an infant daughter, she was undoubtedly a “prime candidate” for a conditional sentence (C.A. reasons, at para. 88). Yet because of the challenged provisions, such a sentence — which would consider her background as an Indigenous woman and draw on Indigenous legal perspectives — was unavailable.  

[225]                     In my view, the impairment of s. 718.2(e) amounts to more than a web of instinct. It reflects a reality long‑recognized throughout our Gladue jurisprudence: removing conditional sentences for many offences has particular impact on Indigenous offenders. The distinction created on the basis of race is apparent.

[226]                     My colleagues would instead adopt the sentencing judge’s reasoning that Ms. Sharma had failed to lead sufficient evidence at stage one, and fault the Court of Appeal for failing to “identify any evidence” presented by Ms. Sharma at stage one (para. 74 (emphasis in original)). They add that Ms. Sharma “adduced no statistical information” to support a distinction (para. 36 (emphasis in original)); that Dr. Murdocca, an expert witness, had testified it was “unknown” whether the impugned provisions had “affect[ed] Aboriginal offenders disproportionately compared to non-Aboriginal offenders” (para. 74 (emphasis deleted)); and that Ms. Sharma “could have presented expert evidence or statistical data showing Indigenous imprisonment disproportionately increased for the specific offences targeted by the impugned provisions, relative to non-Indigenous offenders, after the SSCA came into force” (para. 76).

[227]                     But given the relationship between s. 718.2(e) and ss. 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii), the challenged provisions necessarily impact Indigenous offenders differently; a distinction arises from the interaction of these provisions, against a backdrop of facts of which courts must take judicial notice (Ipeelee, at para. 60). Further evidence is not required because the distinction is plain.

[228]                     And in any event, neither expert evidence nor evidence of statistical disparity are mandatory in s. 15(1) claims (Fraser, at paras. 57 and 67). My colleagues offer no reasons for effectively raising the evidentiary bar of the first step.

[229]                     I have already addressed, in the s. 7 analysis, why the loss of conditional sentences matters, even with the continued availability of lesser non-custodial sentencing options (see paras. 174-176). And as I have explained above, they carry particular importance for Indigenous offenders. I cannot, therefore, accept my colleagues’ further contentions that the impugned provisions create no distinction because s. 718.2(e) remains “meaningfully operable”, and “judges retain broad discretion” as to how to “account [for] the particular circumstances of Indigenous offenders” (paras. 78‑79). The question at this stage is only whether the impugned provisions draw a distinction on a protected ground. And for the reasons I have explained, they do.

(b)         Discrimination

[230]                     The next question is whether the law imposes a burden or denies a benefit in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating disadvantage (Taypotat, at paras. 19-20). For the Crown, the social disadvantages facing Indigenous peoples exist independently of the impugned provisions. Ms. Sharma, in contrast, submits that the impugned provisions deny a benefit that perpetuates or exacerbates disadvantages for Indigenous peoples as a group, and for herself as an individual.

[231]                     I agree with Ms. Sharma. By failing to account for the distinct needs and circumstances of Indigenous offenders, the challenged provisions reinforce, perpetuate, and exacerbate the historical disadvantages of Indigenous peoples in sentencing.

[232]                     My analysis under the second stage proceeds in two parts. First, I show how the provisions, in impairing an ameliorative measure, reinforce, perpetuate, and exacerbate systemic discrimination. Second, I discuss the implications of this finding, and in particular the concern that it would destabilize criminal law as a whole, given the prevalence of discrimination against Indigenous peoples throughout our justice system.

(i)            The Provisions Reinforce, Perpetuate, and Exacerbate Systemic Discrimination

[233]                     The claimant group’s historical position of disadvantage in this case is a matter of judicial notice (Gladue, at para. 83; Wells, at para. 53; Ipeelee, at para. 60). And again, the vast overrepresentation of Indigenous peoples in prisons is well-established.

[234]                     Those disadvantages are worse still for Indigenous women, many of whom continue to face multiple and compounding forms of discrimination. Policies that have removed children from Indigenous families — from the residential school system and the “Sixties Scoop”, to today’s overrepresentation of Indigenous children in care — have disproportionately impacted Indigenous mothers, who are typically primary caretakers (National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, at pp. 281-83). Disenfranchisement under the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5, coercive birth control measures like forced sterilization, pervasive stereotypes, and the ongoing epidemic of violence against Indigenous women and girls have been more direct causes of harm to Indigenous women (pp. 254-56, 266-67, 630-33 and 648-54).

[235]                     This history follows Indigenous women and shapes their experiences — both as victims and offenders — in the criminal justice system. It helps explain why Indigenous women are imprisoned at a higher rate than any other population; why, behind bars, they are more likely to have traumatic histories, mental health challenges, and self-harming tendencies (OCI (2021), at pp. 42-43); why they bear the brunt of prisons’ most punitive conditions (R.F., at paras. 7-8; OCI (2021), at pp. 27 and 42); and why they disproportionately face the risk of permanently losing parental rights (L. Kerr, “How Sentencing Reform Movements Affect Women”, in D. Cole and J. Roberts, eds., Sentencing in Canada: Essays in Law, Policy, and Practice (2020), 250, at p. 254, citing Inglis v. British Columbia (Minister of Public Safety), 2013 BCSC 2309, 298 C.R.R. (2d) 35, at para. 485). Pulling the intergenerational cycle forward, their children often fall into the criminal justice system themselves in the so-called “child-welfare-to-prison pipeline” (C.A. reasons, at para. 96, quoting Ontario Human Rights Commission, Interrupted childhoods: Over-representation of Indigenous and Black children in Ontario child welfare (2018), at pp. 27-28).

[236]                     Tracing the lineage of intergenerational trauma makes clear that our criminal justice system is a significant and ongoing source of discrimination against Indigenous peoples. The fact that the challenged provisions did not create the problem is irrelevant (Alliance, at para. 32; Vriend v. Alberta, 1998 CanLII 816 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 493, at para. 84; Fraser, at para. 71). To blame overrepresentation solely on the pre-existing disadvantages suffered by Indigenous peoples is to ignore the plain reality that incarcerating people is an exercise of state power. And since the state is deeply implicated in the incarceration of Indigenous women through the criminal justice system, it has a constitutional obligation under s. 15(1) of the Charter to ensure that its laws do not operate to reinforce, perpetuate, or exacerbate conditions of inequality.

[237]                     Conditional sentences were never meant to be a catch-all solution. But by impairing the Gladue framework, the challenged provisions removed an accommodation capable of ameliorating, to some degree, these historical disadvantages for Ms. Sharma and other Indigenous offenders. And in my view, that reinforces, perpetuates, and exacerbates their historical disadvantage.

[238]                     First, the impugned provisions logically require sentencing judges to impose more prison sentences than they otherwise would, even when alternatives to prison would be consistent with the Gladue framework and other principles of sentencing. For Indigenous offenders whose background conditions make them especially unfit for prison, whose circumstances rest on the cusp of a prison sentence, but for whom a lesser non-custodial sentence would be inappropriate, this only compounds their disadvantage. 

[239]                     Second, the provisions deny offenders a sentencing option that better accords with Indigenous visions of justice. A uniform approach to sentencing is “often far removed from the understanding of sentencing held by [Indigenous] offenders and their community” (Gladue, at para. 70). And the failure to accommodate the needs, experiences, and perspectives of Indigenous offenders undermines the effectiveness of the sentence itself (Ipeelee, at para. 74).

[240]                     Some of the interveners in this appeal spoke to the latter point. The Legal Services Board of Nunavut submitted that custodial institutions are often geographically distant, displacing Indigenous peoples from their families and communities, as well as their culture, legal orders, and the land. The Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations explained that conditional sentences better facilitate “activities such as ‘on the land’ or ‘bush’ healing camps reflecting sacred connection between Indigenous people and the natural world” — experiences that “cannot be manufactured in an institution” (I.F., at para. 32). And the Ontario Native Women’s Association evoked the more serious impacts incarceration may have in the case of Indigenous women, whose personal losses to cultural identity and spiritual well-being may conjoin with the profound and ongoing impact of their absences on their communities (I.F., at para. 19).

[241]                     The discrimination is apparent. By leaving no other realistic option but prison, where anything less than a conditional sentence would be unfit, ss. 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii) remove “an important tool, and sometimes the only tool, for judges to realize restorative justice principles necessary to craft a fair sentence for Indigenous offenders” (I.F., Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, at para. 5). The restrictions deprive certain Indigenous offenders of sentences that would better accord with their needs and visions of justice. This not only perpetuates overrepresentation, but perpetuates cultural loss, dislocation, and community fragmentation. Substantive equality demands a different approach — one that considers “[t]he types of sentencing procedures and sanctions which may be appropriate in the circumstances for the offender because of his or her particular aboriginal heritage or connection” (Gladue, at para. 66(B); Ipeelee, at para. 66).

[242]                     In my view, Ms. Sharma has met her burden. By impairing this accommodation, these provisions reinforce, perpetuate, and exacerbate the disadvantages of an Indigenous offender.

(ii)         The Floodgates Argument

[243]                     The thrust of the Crown’s position is that this conclusion would have far-reaching repercussions for our constitutional landscape and criminal justice system. My colleagues echo that charge in their reasons (see para. 82). I disagree. Quite the contrary: dismissing this appeal reinforces the rule of law by giving force to s. 15(1) of the Charter.

[244]                     Section 15(1) does not freeze the conditional sentence regime in time, nor does it constitutionalize remedial legislation. Repealing or amending s. 742.1, or even s. 718.2(e), will not automatically contravene s. 15(1), whose focus, again, is on the effects of a law, not its form (Alliance, at para. 33). Parliament could have advanced its policies in other ways: for example, it might have restricted conditional sentences but given sentencing judges residual discretion, or a “safety valve”, to avoid unconstitutional sentences (see R. v. Lloyd, 2016 SCC 13, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 130, at para. 36). Parliament’s enactment of harsher sanctions in general is not the problem; the issue lies in its manner of doing so.

[245]                     And framing the challenged provisions as policy decisions neither sanitizes their effects, nor insulates them from Charter review (Alliance, at para. 35). Parliament has the burden of justifying any inequalities that flow from the operation of its own laws, a burden that speculative concerns about “chilling effect[s]” on remedial initiatives cannot displace (para. 42; Fraser, at paras. 132-36). Holding otherwise would deny courts, and the Charter more broadly, their proper role as a check in our constitutional order. There is nothing novel in courts assuming that role, even when it results in unsettling fixed assumptions about the treatment of the disadvantaged. The true novelty would be to withdraw a category of state actions — such as those repealing or amending existing ameliorative policies — from Charter scrutiny. Nothing restricts courts’ “constitutional duty [to] rule on” those s. 15(1) challenges that are “properly made” (Vriend, at para. 56). Finally, as I have explained, policy reasons in favour of rolling back ameliorative measures are more appropriately considered under s. 1 (Eldridge, at para. 77), where the state may justify its actions. This longstanding framework not only secures legislatures from judicial overreach; it “itself expresses an important aspect of the separation of powers by defining, within its terms, limits on legislative sovereignty” (Newfoundland (Treasury Board) v. N.A.P.E., 2004 SCC 66, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 381, at para. 104; see also C.P., at paras. 173-75, per Kasirer J.).

[246]                     Nor would recognizing a s. 15(1) violation destabilize criminal law provisions of general application. Ms. Sharma’s argument, again, rests not on the existence of social disadvantage alone, but on the impairment of the Gladue framework, which was designed to specifically ameliorate problems in the sentencing of Indigenous offenders. While s. 742.1 is a law of general application, the challenge is not to that provision in isolation. It was enacted in part to enhance s. 718.2(e), and Ms. Sharma’s challenge is directly tied to its implications for the Gladue framework. Thus, the Crown’s suggestion that the application of s. 15(1) of the Charter to this case would facilitate a challenge to all laws of general application — based on their effect on disadvantaged Indigenous peoples — is misplaced.

[247]                     In sum, to be clear, these reasons should not be taken as constitutionalizing remedial legislation. Through s. 718.2(e), Parliament has created a “judicial duty” (Gladue, at para. 34) “to undertake the process of sentencing aboriginal offenders differently, in order to endeavor to achieve a truly fit and proper sentence in the particular case” (para. 33). This Court has found that Parliament’s intent in s. 718.2(e) was to recognize that particular attention should be given to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders “which may specifically make imprisonment a less appropriate or less useful sanction” for those offenders (para. 37). One such circumstance is that, for many such offenders, “community-based sanctions coincide with the aboriginal concept of sentencing and the needs of aboriginal people and communities” (para. 74). The exercise of this duty pursuant to s. 718.2(e) is to be undertaken in a manner consonant with principles of restraint, proportionality and individualization in sentencing.

[248]                     The ability of courts to give effect to s. 718.2(e) and apply the Gladue framework is central to this appeal. Sections 742.1 and 718.2(e) are intimately connected in both purpose and operation. The “unique circumstances” of Aboriginal offenders mean that community-based sanctions are in many cases appropriate and indeed commanded under s. 718.2(e) as a matter of fair and proportionate sentencing for offenders who, as a group, are understood to be disadvantaged (Gladue, at paras. 37-38). The majority of the Court of Appeal was right to observe that by restricting the availability of the conditional sentence option, the impugned provisions perpetuate an already existing disadvantage suffered by Aboriginal offenders (paras. 83-85). In these specific circumstances, courts cannot give proper effect to Parliament’s will as expressed through s. 718.2(e) and this Court’s instructions in Gladue without the tool of community-based conditional sentences.

[249]                     Recognizing and giving effect to adverse discrimination claims ensures the promise of s. 15(1) does not ring hollow. This affirms, rather than denies, the rule of law.

(3)         Conclusion

[250]                     This case offers an opportunity to ensure that Indigenous peoples in the criminal justice system are entitled to equal protection and benefit under the law. I conclude that ss. 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii) limit Ms. Sharma’s s. 15(1) Charter rights.

V.           Section 1

[251]                     The question becomes whether the limitations on ss. 7 and 15(1) of the Charter are “demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society”, under s. 1. In my view, they are not.

[252]                     The framework under s. 1 is well-established. The Crown must demonstrate that the legislative objective is pressing and substantial, and that the means chosen are proportional to that objective, in that “(1) the means adopted are rationally connected to that objective; (2) it is minimally impairing of the right in question; and (3) there is proportionality between the deleterious and salutary effects of the law” (Carter, at para. 94, citing R. v. Oakes, 1986 CanLII 46 (SCC), [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103).

[253]                     As I have explained, the challenged provisions limit two different Charter rights, which colour the s. 1 analysis in different ways. Section 7 violations are, in general, “difficult to justify” under s. 1, although it may be possible for the state to show that the violation is justified by a public good not captured under the rubric of life, liberty or security of the person (Carter, at para. 95). Section 15(1) violations, however, have been justified under s. 1 (McKinney v. University of Guelph, 1990 CanLII 60 (SCC), [1990] 3 S.C.R. 229; Weatherall v. Canada (Attorney General), 1993 CanLII 112 (SCC), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 872; Egan v. Canada, 1995 CanLII 98 (SCC), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 513; Lavoie v. Canada, 2002 SCC 23, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 769; N.A.P.E.; Quebec v. A). When a law or state action limits multiple Charter rights, the state must justify all of the limitations to avoid a finding of unconstitutionality.

[254]                     The parties agree that the provisions serve a pressing and substantial objective, yet disagree over whether they satisfy the proportionality branch of the test. The standard at this stage is not perfection; the legislature is owed a measure of deference, especially when legislating in areas involving “a number of possible solutions to a particular social problem” (Carter, at para. 97).

[255]                     Still, the burden is the Crown’s at this stage. As both lower courts remarked, however, the Crown made relatively little attempt to justify the provisions in the lower court proceedings. The same is true here.

[256]                     Ms. Sharma argues that there is no rational connection between the provisions’ ends and the means chosen to achieve them: although the challenged legislation took away conditional sentences, it left “lesser non-custodial options available”, such as suspended sentences (R.F., at para. 86). I cannot accept this argument. There is a rational connection between ensuring serious crimes are punished by incarceration and removing the possibility of conditional sentences for certain offences.

[257]                     But the provisions are not minimally impairing. The state must show that there is no “less drastic means of achieving the objective in a real and substantial manner” (Alberta v. Hutterian Brethren of Wilson Colony, 2009 SCC 37, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 567, at para. 55). And the Crown has not shown this in respect of either breach. The Crown’s argument that the provisions only remove one sentencing option fails to explain why circumscribing that one option could not have been better tailored, either with respect to the liberty or equality interests engaged. Like the majority in the court below, I would reject it.

[258]                     Nor are the provisions’ salutary effects proportionate to their deleterious effects. The Crown has led no evidence to suggest that the benefits to incarcerating those offenders who were formerly eligible for a conditional sentence outweighed the costs to their liberty. And the costs to the equality interests of Indigenous peoples are still more profound, since they may include separation from one’s community, work or family — harms only exacerbated in the case of young single mothers — while contributing to the continued overrepresentation of Indigenous offenders in prison, with all of its intergenerational fallout.

[259]                     The state has not met its burden under s. 1.

VI.         Conclusion

[260]                     I conclude that ss. 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii) are unconstitutional. Neither party made submissions on the appropriate remedy, and, in my view, an immediate declaration of invalidity under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, as ordered by the majority of the Court of Appeal, was in any event the right outcome. I would therefore dismiss the appeal. 

 

                    Appeal allowed, Karakatsanis, Martin, Kasirer and Jamal JJ. dissenting.

JUDGMENT

 

The appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, Number C66431, 2022 ONCA 155, dated February 22, 2022, was heard on November 9, 2022, and the Court on that day delivered the following judgment orally:

 

 

Kasirer J. — A majority of the Court would allow the appeal. The trial judge’s instructions for Mr. Doxtator properly left with the jury the reasonably available verdicts. As MacPherson J.A., dissenting, correctly observed in the Court of Appeal, the trial judge explicitly instructed the jury to consider Mr. Doxtator’s case separately from that of the co-accused. Nothing in the record on appeal permits this Court to depart from the assumption that juries generally follow explicit instructions: see R. v. Corbett, 1988 CanLII 80 (SCC), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, at pp. 692-93. This is sufficient for the appeal to be allowed, to set aside the order for a new trial for the respondent Richard Doxtator and to restore his conviction for first degree murder.

 

 

 

Justices Karakatsanis and Rowe, dissenting, would dismiss the appeal substantially for the reasons of Roberts J.A. in the Court of Appeal.

Appendix — Arbitration Agreements

 

I.               Overview

[1]                              This appeal calls upon our Court to clarify whether and in what circumstances a contractual agreement to arbitrate governed by the Arbitration Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 55 (“Arbitration Act”), should give way to the public interest in the orderly and efficient resolution of a court‑ordered receivership under s. 243 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B‑3 (“BIA”).

[2]                              A construction dispute underlies this appeal. The appellant Peace River Hydro Partners is a partnership formed to build a hydroelectric dam in northeastern British Columbia. Two members of that partnership, and their parent corporations, are also appellants in this Court (collectively, “Peace River”). The respondent Petrowest Corporation (“Petrowest”) is an Alberta‑based construction company. In December 2015, Peace River agreed to subcontract certain work to Petrowest and its affiliates (“Petrowest Affiliates”), which are also respondents in this appeal. The parties executed several clauses providing that disputes arising from their relationship were to be resolved through arbitration (“Arbitration Agreements”).

[3]                              But Petrowest soon found itself in dire financial straits. The Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench ordered Petrowest and the Petrowest Affiliates into receivership pursuant to s. 243 of the BIA. The respondent Ernst & Young Inc. acts as their court‑appointed receiver and manager (“Receiver”). The Receiver brought a civil claim in the Supreme Court of British Columbia seeking to collect accounts receivable allegedly owed to Petrowest and the Petrowest Affiliates by Peace River. The latter applied to stay the civil proceedings under s. 15 of the Arbitration Act on the ground that the Arbitration Agreements governed the dispute. The Receiver opposed the stay application on behalf of Petrowest and the Petrowest Affiliates, arguing that the BIA authorized the court to assert centralized judicial control over the matter rather than send the Receiver to multiple arbitral forums.

[4]                              The chambers judge agreed with the Receiver and dismissed the stay application. The Court of Appeal upheld the chambers judge’s ruling on the basis that the Receiver was not a “party” to the Arbitration Agreements within the meaning of s. 15(1) of the Arbitration Act. It held that the doctrine of separability allowed the Receiver to disclaim the Arbitration Agreements and sue on the underlying contracts to recover payment for past performance. Peace River now asks this Court to set aside both decisions below and stay the court proceedings in favour of arbitration.

[5]                              I would dismiss the appeal and affirm the dismissal of the stay application by the courts below. The civil claim brought by the Receiver on behalf of Petrowest and the Petrowest Affiliates may proceed. This conclusion flows from the following two‑part analysis, which is mandated by s. 15 of the Arbitration Act and outlined in further detail later in these reasons.

[6]                              First, the Court of Appeal erred in concluding that s. 15 was not engaged because the Receiver was not a “party” to the Arbitration Agreements. Permitting a court‑appointed receiver to avoid arbitration on the basis that it is not a party to the debtor’s pre‑existing agreement to arbitrate is inconsistent with a proper reading of s. 15, ordinary principles of contract law, party autonomy, and this Court’s longstanding jurisprudence with respect to arbitration. Nor can disclaimer or the doctrine of separability permit receivers to unilaterally render otherwise valid arbitration agreements “inoperative” or “incapable of being performed” within the meaning of s. 15. Only a court can make a finding that an arbitration agreement is inoperative or incapable of being performed.

[7]                              Second, although s. 15 is engaged, the chambers judge was entitled to refuse to grant a stay under s. 15(2). An otherwise valid arbitration agreement may, in some circumstances, be inoperative or incapable of being performed. For example, an arbitration agreement may be inoperative if enforcing it would compromise court‑ordered receivership proceedings under s. 243 of the BIA. This may occur where the arbitration agreed to by the parties would preclude the orderly and efficient resolution of the receivership, contrary to the purposes of the BIA.

[8]                              To be clear, the fact that a party has entered receivership or insolvency proceedings or is financially impecunious is not, on its own, a sufficient basis for a court to find an arbitration agreement inoperative. The party seeking to avoid arbitration must establish, on a balance of probabilities, that a stay in favour of arbitration would compromise the integrity of the parallel insolvency proceedings. The following non‑exhaustive list of factors, discussed further below, may assist in the court’s analysis: (a) the effect of arbitration on the integrity of the insolvency proceedings, which are intended to minimize economic prejudice to creditors; (b) the relative prejudice to the parties to the arbitration agreement and the debtor’s stakeholders; (c) the urgency of resolving the dispute; (d) the effect of a stay of proceedings arising from the bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, if applicable; and (e) any other factors the court considers material in the circumstances.

[9]                              Applying the above factors, I find that the chambers judge correctly dismissed the stay application. The Arbitration Agreements are inoperative within the meaning of s. 15(2) of the Arbitration Act. Sections 243 and 183 of the BIA authorize courts to do what practicality demands in the context of a receivership. In this case, practicality demands that the Arbitration Agreements not be enforced, in the interest of an orderly and efficient resolution of the receivership. In short, the chaotic nature of the arbitral proceedings bargained for by the parties would compromise the integrity of the receivership, to the detriment of affected creditors and contrary to the purposes of the BIA.

[10]                          I stress that this result is context‑specific. The unique facts of this case, which pit the public policy objectives underlying the BIA against freedom of contract and party autonomy, justify departing from the legislative and judicial preference for holding parties to their arbitration agreements. Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, arbitration law and insolvency law need not always exist at “polar extremes”. They have much in common, including an emphasis on efficiency and expediency, procedural flexibility, and expert decision‑making. These shared interests often converge through arbitration, such that granting a stay in favour of arbitration will promote the objectives of both provincial arbitration legislation and federal insolvency legislation. It is for this reason that courts should generally hold parties to their agreements to arbitrate, even if one of them has become insolvent. To do otherwise would not only threaten the important public policy served by enforcing arbitration agreements and thus Canada’s position as a leader in commercial arbitration, but also jeopardize the public interest in the expeditious, efficient, and economical clean‑up of the aftermath of a financial collapse.

II.            Background

[11]                          Peace River was formed to design and construct works at the Site C Project, a major dam and hydroelectric generating station on the Peace River in northeastern British Columbia. The partnership includes the appellants Acciona Infrastructure Canada Inc. and Samsung C&T Canada Ltd., which are the Canadian subsidiaries of the appellants Acciona Infraestructuras S.A. and Samsung C&T Corporation.

[12]                          Petrowest is the third member of the partnership. The following agreements between the parties are relevant to this appeal (collectively, “Main Agreements”):

•                        a general partnership agreement dated December 17, 2015, between Acciona Infrastructure Canada Inc., Samsung C&T Canada Ltd., and Petrowest, creating Peace River (“Partnership Agreement”);

•                        a guarantee and cross‑indemnity agreement dated December 17, 2015, between Acciona Infraestructuras S.A., Samsung C&T Corporation, and Petrowest, guaranteeing the obligations of the subsidiary partners to the Partnership Agreement (“Guarantee”);

•                        purchase orders under which Peace River subcontracted certain work to Petrowest and the Petrowest Affiliates (“Purchase Orders”); and

•                        a subcontract dated June 1, 2016, between a Petrowest Affiliate and Peace River, awarding further subcontracted work.

[13]                          The Main Agreements contain the Arbitration Agreements in which the parties agree to refer disputes to arbitration. It should be noted, however, that the wording of each Arbitration Agreement differs.[1] Each applies to a different set of potential disputes and provides for different arbitration procedures. And some of the Purchase Orders do not contain arbitration clauses.

[14]                          Less than two years into the partnership, Petrowest encountered financial difficulties. It entered receivership on August 15, 2017. The Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench granted a receivership order pursuant to s. 243(1) of the BIA (“Receivership Order”). The Receivership Order appointed the Receiver to manage the assets and property of the debtors, Petrowest and the Petrowest Affiliates. It authorized the Receiver to do the following, among other things: (a) disclaim, abandon or renounce the debtors’ interest in property; (b) initiate the prosecution of “any and all proceedings” with respect to the debtors and their property; (c) assign the debtors into bankruptcy, become their trustee in bankruptcy, and take all steps reasonably required to carry out its role as trustee in bankruptcy; (d) “cease to perform any contracts of the Debtors”; and (e) “receive and collect all monies and accounts” owing to the debtors (A.R., vol. XI, at pp. 2900‑2903).

[15]                          On April 3, 2018, the Receiver assigned the Petrowest Affiliates into bankruptcy and became their trustee in bankruptcy. It is important to note that Petrowest itself is not bankrupt.

[16]                          On August 29, 2018, the Receiver brought a civil claim against Peace River in the Supreme Court of British Columbia on behalf of Petrowest and the Petrowest Affiliates. The Receiver sought to collect funds allegedly owing to Petrowest and the Petrowest Affiliates for performance of work subcontracted under the Main Agreements.

[17]                          On August 30, 2018, Peace River was served with the notice of civil claim. In a letter dated September 28, 2018, counsel for Peace River undertook to file a defence. Instead, Peace River ultimately applied under s. 15 of the Arbitration Act for a stay of proceedings on the ground that the Arbitration Agreements governed the dispute. The Receiver resisted the application on behalf of Petrowest and the Petrowest Affiliates.

III.         Statutory Provisions

[18]                          This appeal concerns the interplay between two statutes: the Arbitration Act and the BIA. The key sections of these two statutes are set out below.

IV.         Decisions Below

A.           British Columbia Supreme Court, 2019 BCSC 2221, 100 B.L.R. (5th) 128 (Iyer J.)

[19]                          The first issue before the chambers judge was whether s. 15 of the Arbitration Act was engaged. If so, the second issue was whether the court had jurisdiction to decline a stay notwithstanding the application of s. 15(1) of the Arbitration Act. Under s. 15(2), the court would be required to stay the proceedings in favour of arbitration unless it found the Arbitration Agreements “void, inoperative or incapable of being performed”.

[20]                          On the first issue, the chambers judge held that s. 15 was engaged. She analyzed the four requirements for a mandatory stay contemplated in s. 15.

[21]                          First, the chambers judge found that the Receiver was a “party to an arbitration agreement” within the meaning of s. 15(1). She stated that the Receiver was “the trustee in bankruptcy of Petrowest and the Petrowest Affiliates”, such that it had acquired their contractual rights to sue on the Main Agreements pursuant to s. 71 of the BIA (paras. 16‑17). She concluded that by suing on the Main Agreements “in its own name as the trustee”, the Receiver became a party to the Arbitration Agreements within the meaning of s. 15(1) (para. 19).

[22]                          Second, the chambers judge rejected the argument that Peace River had taken a “step in the proceedings” before bringing its stay application. She held that undertaking to file a defence without invoking the rules of court did not constitute a step in the proceedings (Commonwealth Insurance Co. v. Larc Developments Ltd., 2010 BCCA 18, 315 D.L.R. (4th) 242).

[23]                          Third, the chambers judge concluded that at least some of the contractual claims advanced by the Receiver were captured under the broadly worded Arbitration Agreements.

[24]                          Finally, the chambers judge was “prepared to assume” that at least some of the Arbitration Agreements at issue were not void, inoperative, or incapable of performance within the meaning of s. 15(2) (para. 33).

[25]                          On the second issue before her, the chambers judge concluded that the court had “inherent jurisdiction”, flowing from s. 183 of the BIA, to override arbitration agreements governed by s. 15 of the Arbitration Act. She noted that the exercise of this power could function in one of two ways: (a) it could render an arbitration clause incapable of being performed or inoperative within the meaning of s. 15(2); or (b) if s. 15(2) did not admit of that interpretation, s. 183 of the BIA could prevail over s. 15 of the Arbitration Act based on the principle of paramountcy. The chambers judge did not address this question because it had not been argued before her (para. 42).

[26]                          The chambers judge went on to exercise her “inherent jurisdiction” to dismiss the stay application. She found that s. 183 of the BIA empowers superior courts to disrupt private contractual rights where doing so is necessary to achieve fairness in the bankruptcy or insolvency process and to promote the underlying objectives of the BIA, such as the proper administration and protection of a bankrupt’s estate.

[27]                          The chambers judge noted that enforcing the Arbitration Agreements would entail multiple overlapping arbitrations and potential litigation, resulting in “significant cost and delay” when compared with a single judicial proceeding (para. 60). She emphasized that the parties agreed that overriding the Arbitration Agreements “would promote the efficient and inexpensive resolution of their dispute” (para. 56). On this basis, the chambers judge concluded that granting a stay would “significantly compromise achievement of the objectives of the BIA” (para. 61). She dismissed Peace River’s stay application and allowed the civil claim to proceed.

B.            British Columbia Court of Appeal, 2020 BCCA 339, 452 D.L.R. (4th) 535 (Bennett, Dickson and Grauer JJ.A.)

[28]                          Peace River appealed the chambers judge’s decision, primarily on the basis that courts do not have inherent jurisdiction under s. 183 of the BIA to decline a stay mandated by s. 15 of the Arbitration Act.

[29]                          The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal but did not endorse the chambers judge’s reasoning. It cautioned that inherent jurisdiction should be invoked only rarely and cannot be used to negate an unambiguous expression of legislative will (Ontario v. Criminal Lawyers’ Association of Ontario, 2013 SCC 43, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 3; Residential Warranty Co. of Canada Inc. (Re), 2006 ABCA 293, 275 D.L.R. (4th) 498; United Used Auto & Truck Parts Ltd., Re, 2000 BCCA 146, 16 C.B.R. (4th) 141). However, the Court of Appeal found it unnecessary to consider whether the chambers judge had discretion under the BIA to refuse to grant a stay notwithstanding the application of s. 15 of the Arbitration Act.

[30]                          The Court of Appeal relied on the doctrine of separability in arbitration law, which permits an arbitration clause to be treated as a “self‑contained contract collateral to the containing contract” (Harbour Assurance Co. (U.K.) Ltd. v. Kansa General International Insurance Co. Ltd., [1993] 3 W.L.R. 42 (C.A.), at p. 49; see also Uber Technologies Inc. v. Heller, 2020 SCC 16, at paras. 221‑25, per Côté J., dissenting, but not on this point). According to the Court of Appeal, separability allows a receiver, as a court‑appointed fiduciary, to disclaim an otherwise valid arbitration agreement even though it has adopted the containing contract for the purpose of suing on it (para. 55).

[31]                          Applying the doctrine of separability, the Court of Appeal found that the Receiver had disclaimed the Arbitration Agreements by bringing the civil claim on behalf of Petrowest and the Petrowest Affiliates. Accordingly, the Receiver was not a party to those agreements and s. 15 of the Arbitration Act did not apply. In any event, if the Receiver was a party, its disclaimer rendered the Arbitration Agreements inoperative or incapable of being performed within the meaning of s. 15(2) (para. 56). Accordingly, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, upholding the chambers judge’s decision to refuse to grant a stay in favour of arbitration.

V.           Issues

[32]                          This appeal raises the following question:

•                        In what circumstances is an otherwise valid arbitration agreement unenforceable under s. 15(2) of the Arbitration Act in the context of a court‑ordered receivership under the BIA?

[33]                          This question raises the following sub‑questions:

(a)                  Did the Court of Appeal err in concluding that s. 15 of the Arbitration Act is not engaged?

(b)                  If s. 15 is engaged, did the chambers judge err in finding that a court nevertheless has jurisdiction to refuse a stay of proceedings in the context of a court‑ordered receivership under the BIA?

(c)                  If a court has jurisdiction to refuse to grant a stay in the context of a court‑ordered receivership, how should this jurisdiction be exercised in this case?

[34]                          In brief, I conclude that s. 15 of the Arbitration Act does not require a court, in every case, to stay a civil claim brought by a court‑appointed receiver where the claim is subject to a valid arbitration agreement. A court may decline to grant a stay where the party seeking to avoid arbitration establishes that the arbitration agreement at issue is “void, inoperative or incapable of being performed” within the meaning of s. 15(2). In the context of a court‑ordered receivership, an arbitration agreement may be inoperative if enforcing it would compromise the orderly and efficient resolution of the receivership. This analysis necessarily turns on the particular factual scenario before the court.

[35]                          Applying the foregoing, I find that the Receiver, on behalf of Petrowest and the Petrowest Affiliates, has established that the Arbitration Agreements are inoperative. I see no basis on which to interfere with the chambers judge’s finding that a single judicial process “will be faster and less expensive” than the multiple overlapping proceedings required by the Arbitration Agreements (para. 56). The parties agreed before the chambers judge that proceeding through the courts, rather than by arbitration, “would promote the efficient and inexpensive resolution of their dispute” (para. 56). On this basis, I conclude that arbitration would compromise the orderly and efficient resolution of the receivership, contrary to the objectives of the BIA.

[36]                          Therefore, the chambers judge was entitled to refuse Peace River’s request for a stay in favour of arbitration under s. 15(2) of the Arbitration Act. I would accordingly dismiss the appeal.

VI.         Analysis

[37]                          My analysis below proceeds as follows. First, I explain and apply the “competence‑competence” principle. Second, I discuss the relationship between arbitration law and insolvency law, including key commonalities between these bodies of law. Third, I outline the general two‑part framework applicable on stay applications brought under domestic arbitration legislation in Canada. Fourth, I interpret s. 15 of the Arbitration Act and resolve the four interpretive issues raised. Finally, I apply the two‑part s. 15 stay framework to this case.

A.           Competence‑Competence Principle

[38]                          I begin with a discussion of the competence‑competence principle in Canadian arbitration law, as it is germane to the issues in this appeal.

(1)         General Principle

[39]                          Competence‑competence is a principle that gives precedence to the arbitration process. It holds that, generally speaking, “arbitrators should be allowed to exercise their power to rule first on their own jurisdiction” (Dell Computer Corp. v. Union des consommateurs, 2007 SCC 34, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 801, at para. 70). This preference for arbitration is a departure from the traditional approach in Canada, which favoured an interventionist judicial role (Dell, at para. 69). Historically, judges took a dim view of arbitration, “treating it as a ‘second‑class method of dispute resolution’” (TELUS Communications Inc. v. Wellman, 2019 SCC 19, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 144, at para. 48; Seidel v. TELUS Communications Inc., 2011 SCC 15, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 531, at para. 96).

[40]                          However, in 1986, Canada acceded to the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, Can. T.S. 1986 No. 43 (“New York Convention”), which established a single, uniform set of rules for international commercial arbitration that applied worldwide. Canada also adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, U.N. Doc. A/40/17, Ann. I, June 21, 1985 (“Model Law”), prepared by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. The Model Law was intended to guide legislative development in jurisdictions seeking to establish a modern legal framework in order to encourage commercial arbitration (J. K. McEwan and L. B. Herbst, Commercial Arbitration in Canada: A Guide to Domestic and International Arbitrations (loose‑leaf), at § 1:4). Article 16 of the Model Law articulates the competence‑competence principle. British Columbia adopted the principle, as set out in the Model Law, through s. 22 of the Arbitration Act (Seidel, at para. 28).

[41]                          In light of the foregoing, it is well established in Canada that a challenge to an arbitrator’s jurisdiction should generally be decided at first instance by the arbitrator (see Uber, at paras. 31‑34; Seidel; Dell; Rogers Wireless Inc. v. Muroff, 2007 SCC 35, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 921). This reflects the presumption that arbitrators have fact‑finding expertise comparable to that of courts, and that the parties intended an arbitrator to determine the validity and scope of their agreement (McEwan and Herbst, at § 5:10).

(2)         Exceptions to the Competence‑Competence Principle

[42]                          The competence‑competence principle is not absolute, however. A court may resolve a challenge to an arbitrator’s jurisdiction if the challenge involves pure questions of law, or questions of mixed fact and law requiring only superficial consideration of the evidentiary record (Uber, at para. 32; Dell, at paras. 84‑85). This exception is justified by the particular expertise that courts have in deciding such questions. Further, it allows a legal argument relating to the arbitrator’s jurisdiction “to be resolved once and for all, and also allows the parties to avoid duplication of a strictly legal debate” (Dell, at para. 84).

(3)         Application of the Principle in This Case

[43]                          The questions in this appeal are of mixed fact and law. In the circumstances of this case, all that is required is the interpretation of arbitration and insolvency legislation and a superficial consideration of the evidentiary record. Accordingly, a court is entitled to resolve the question of arbitral jurisdiction without offending the competence‑competence principle.

B.            Relationship Between Arbitration Law and Insolvency Law

[44]                          To decide this appeal, I must determine the effect, if any, that the receivership of Petrowest and the Petrowest Affiliates under the federal BIA has on the Arbitration Agreements, which are governed by British Columbia’s Arbitration Act. Before I do so, it is helpful to explain the interaction between arbitration law and insolvency law more generally.

[45]                          Arbitration law and insolvency law have long been understood to embody “opposing interests” (see, e.g., W. Kühn, “Arbitration and Insolvency” (2011), 5 Disp. Res. Int’l 203, at p. 203; M. A. Salzberg and G. M. Zinkgraf, “When Worlds Collide: The Enforceability of Arbitration Agreements in Bankruptcy” (2007), 27 Franchise L.J. 37; P. F. Kirgis, “Arbitration, Bankruptcy, and Public Policy: A Contractarian Analysis” (2009), 17 Am. Bankr. Inst. L. Rev. 503; D. Chan and S. Rajagopal, “To Stay or Not to Stay? A Clash of Arbitration and Insolvency Regimes” (2021), 38 J. Int’l Arb. 457). In an oft‑cited passage, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit described the interaction between arbitration law and insolvency law as “a conflict of near polar extremes: bankruptcy policy exerts an inexorable pull towards centralization while arbitration policy advocates a decentralized approach towards dispute resolution” (In re U.S. Lines, Inc., 197 F.3d 631 (1999), at p. 640; see also Societe Nationale Algerienne v. Distrigas Corp., 80 B.R. 606 (D. Mass. 1987), at p. 610).

[46]                          Recently, two trends have thrown this tension into sharp relief. First, arbitration has become an increasingly popular mechanism for resolving commercial disputes, both in Canada and abroad (Wellman, at para. 54; Seidel, at para. 23). Today, parties and counsel alike recognize the potential strategic and tactical advantages of arbitration as compared to traditional litigation. These may include privacy and confidentiality, efficiency and timeliness, relaxed rules of evidence, freedom to determine procedural rules and select decision makers with relevant expertise, and cross‑border enforceability of awards (J. B. Casey, Arbitration Law of Canada: Practice and Procedure (3rd ed. 2017), at ch. 1.6).

[47]                          Second, economic shocks, including the 2008 financial crisis and the disruptions resulting from the COVID‑19 pandemic, have placed increased demands on our insolvency laws (L. W. Houlden, G. B. Morawetz and J. Sarra, Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law of Canada (4th ed. rev. (loose‑leaf)), at § 1:6; H. Esslinger, “Creditors Over Contract: A Case Comment on Chandos”, in J. Corraini and D. B. Nixon, eds., Annual Review of Insolvency Law 2021 (2022), 747; V. W. DaRe and T. Prpa, “Imagine One Restructuring Act in Canada” (2021), 36 B.F.L.R. 363, at p. 364).

[48]                          It is thus not unusual now for a commercial party to find itself in a dispute governed by an arbitration agreement with an insolvent or bankrupt counterparty. In this scenario, there is a tension between arbitration law and insolvency law as regards the forum in which the dispute is to be resolved. To understand this tension, it is necessary to briefly outline the characteristics of arbitration and insolvency proceedings. Despite clear differences, these two bodies of law have much in common. Accordingly, as I will explain, courts must assess the enforceability of arbitration agreements in the context of parallel insolvency proceedings on a case‑by‑case basis. Below, I provide guidance in this regard.

(1)         Dispute Resolution by Arbitration

[49]                          The modern view expressed in Canadian arbitration legislation is that parties should be held to their contractual agreements to arbitrate. This gives effect to the concept of “party autonomy”, according to which parties are free to “charter a private tribunal” to resolve their disputes (Wellman, at para. 52, citing Astoria Medical Group v. Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York, 182 N.E.2d 85 (N.Y. 1962), at p. 87; M. Pavlović and A. Daimsis, “Arbitration”, in J. C. Kleefeld et al., eds., Dispute Resolution: Readings and Case Studies (4th ed. 2016), 483, at p. 485). Party autonomy is closely related to freedom of contract (Hofer v. Hofer, 1970 CanLII 161 (SCC), [1970] S.C.R. 958, at p. 963). Modern arbitration legislation is premised on these principles, which inform the policy choices embodied in provincial arbitration statutes like the Arbitration Act (Wellman, at para. 52).

[50]                          Party autonomy and freedom of contract go hand in hand with the principle of limited court intervention in arbitral proceedings. This latter principle is “fundamental” to modern arbitration law and “finds expression throughout modern Canadian arbitration legislation” (Wellman, at paras. 52‑55; McEwan and Herbst, at § 10:2; Casey, at ch. 7.1). For instance, s. 4(a) of British Columbia’s new Arbitration Act, S.B.C. 2020, c. 2, provides that “[i]n matters governed by this Act, a court must not intervene unless so provided in this Act”. Similar expressions of principle are found in provincial arbitration legislation across the country. It follows that, generally speaking, judicial intervention in commercial disputes governed by a valid arbitration clause should be the exception, not the rule.

(2)         Dispute Resolution in Insolvency

[51]                          On the other hand, insolvency proceedings are creatures of statute subject to close judicial oversight.

[52]                          Insolvency engages broad public interests. It “affects all of the stakeholders of the insolvent business enterprise”, including creditors, employees, landlords, suppliers, shareholders, and customers (K. P. McElcheran, Commercial Insolvency in Canada (4th ed. 2019), at ¶1.1). In the case of very large companies, an insolvency may even “threaten the existence of whole communities” (¶1.1). Canadian legislation therefore offers stakeholders a wide range of judicial procedures to resolve problems presented by an insolvency (¶¶1.1‑1.12).

[53]                          This procedural flexibility has allowed Canadian courts to become instrumental in (a) providing a forum for the orderly resolution of the competing rights and objectives of individual stakeholders of insolvent business enterprises, and (b) creating mechanisms for the preservation of the value of the insolvent business or its assets for the benefit of all stakeholders (Century Services Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2010 SCC 60, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 379, at paras. 2 and 22; McElcheran, at ¶¶1.1‑1.14). I elaborate on these two points below.

(a)           Single Proceeding Model

[54]                          The central role of courts in ensuring the equitable and orderly resolution of insolvency disputes is reflected in the “single proceeding model”.

[55]                          This model favours the enforcement of stakeholder rights through a centralized judicial process. The legislative policy in favour of “single control” is reflected in Canadian bankruptcy, insolvency, and winding‑up legislation (Century Services, at paras. 22‑23). The single proceeding model is intended to mitigate the inefficiency and chaos that would result if each stakeholder in an insolvency initiated a separate claim to enforce its rights. In other words, the single proceeding model protects the clear “public interest in the expeditious, efficient and economical clean‑up of the aftermath of a financial collapse” (Sam Lévy & Associés Inc. v. Azco Mining Inc., 2001 SCC 92, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 978, at para. 27, citing Stewart v. LePage (1916), 1916 CanLII 626 (SCC), 53 S.C.R. 337). This Court has held that s. 183(1) of the BIA confers a “broad scope of authority” on superior courts to deal with most bankruptcy disputes, as “[a]nything less would unnecessarily complicate and undermine the economical and expeditious winding up of the bankrupt’s affairs” (Sam Lévy, at para. 38).

(b)         Court‑Ordered Receiverships Under the BIA

[56]                          Court‑ordered receiverships under s. 243 of the BIA, like the receivership in the present case, are one available tool for enhancing the judicial oversight and flexibility underlying Canadian insolvency law. Section 243(1) of the BIA confers broad authority on a court to appoint a receiver if the court “considers it to be just or convenient to do so”. Under s. 243(1), a court may appoint a receiver to do any of the following, with a view to enhancing and facilitating the preservation and realization of the debtor’s assets for the benefit of all creditors: (a) take possession of all or substantially all of the debtor’s inventory, accounts receivable or other property that was acquired for or used in relation to a business carried on by the debtor; (b) exercise any control that the court considers advisable over that property and over the debtor’s business; or (c) take “any other action that the court considers advisable” (R. J. Wood, Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law (2nd ed. 2015), at pp. 553‑54).

[57]                          Given the breadth of their powers, court‑appointed receivers are necessarily subject to close judicial oversight. Receivers represent neither a security holder nor the debtor; they are officers of the court whose “sole authority is derived from . . . Court appointment and from the directions given [to them] by the Court” (Ostrander v. Niagara Helicopters Ltd. (1973), 1973 CanLII 467 (ON SC), 1 O.R. (2d) 281 (H.C.), at p. 286). In most cases, including the one at bar, a court order under s. 243 of the BIA gives a receiver wide‑ranging powers.

[58]                          Despite this flexibility, court‑appointed receivers have a fiduciary duty to act honestly and in the best interests of all interested parties. For example, a receiver is generally not permitted to terminate existing contracts between third parties and the debtor, but must apply to the court to discharge onerous contracts, such as those which would be unduly costly to perform (F. Bennett, Bennett on Receiverships (3rd ed. 2011), at p. 42; Parsons v. Sovereign Bank of Canada, 1912 CanLII 365 (UK JCPC), [1913] A.C. 160 (P.C.), per Viscount Haldane L.C.). This demonstrates the key supervisory role that courts play in receivership proceedings.

(3)         Commonalities Between Arbitration Law and Insolvency Law

[59]                          Notwithstanding the differences just described, arbitration law and insolvency law also have much in common. Below, I address three commonalities that are particularly relevant to this appeal.

(a)           Efficiency and Expediency

[60]                          First and foremost, arbitration law and insolvency law each prioritize efficiency and expediency.

[61]                          Commercial arbitration is a “process designed to enable parties to deal with disputes efficiently, effectively and economically” (McEwan and Herbst, at § 2:1, citing Hayes Forest Services Ltd. v. Weyerhaeuser Co., 2008 BCCA 31, 289 D.L.R. (4th) 230, at para. 1). As such, it is expected to be “less formal, more expeditious and therefore faster than a court determination of issues” (Rosenberg v. Minster, 2014 ONSC 845, 119 O.R. (3d) 27, at para. 58).

[62]                          Likewise, the raison d’être of the single proceeding model in Canadian insolvency law is the “expeditious, efficient and economical clean‑up of the aftermath of a financial collapse”. To maximize global recovery for creditors, this model avoids “inefficiencies and chaos” by “favouring an orderly collective process” (Alberta (Attorney General) v. Moloney, 2015 SCC 51, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 327, at para. 33; Husky Oil Operations Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, 1995 CanLII 69 (SCC), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 453, at para. 7).

[63]                          As noted, the single proceeding model applies to proceedings under the BIA, the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑36 (“CCAA”), and other insolvency legislation. For example, s. 243 of the BIA authorizes a court to appoint a receiver with the power to act nationally. This promotes efficiency “by removing the need to have a receiver appointed in each jurisdiction in which the debtor’s assets are located” (Houlden, Morawetz and Sarra, at § 12:3).

(b)         Procedural Flexibility

[64]                          Further, procedural flexibility is a hallmark of both arbitration law and insolvency law.

[65]                          Chief among the reputed advantages of arbitration is the freedom of parties to choose their own procedural rules rather than being bound by rules of court (Seidel, at para. 22; Wellman, at paras. 48‑56; L. Y. Fortier, “Delimiting the Spheres of Judicial and Arbitral Power: ‘Beware, My Lord, of Jealousy’” (2001), 80 Can. Bar Rev. 143). This enhances expediency and cost‑effectiveness in arbitral proceedings, where discovery procedures can be curtailed, written submissions can be used instead of witness testimony, and strict evidentiary rules can be relaxed (McEwan and Herbst, at §§ 2:1 and 7:12).

[66]                          Flexibility is likewise a characteristic of Canadian insolvency law. But in the insolvency context, both the court and the parties can tailor proceedings to fit a particular case. Indeed, the BIA and the CCAA both accord broad judicial discretion to, among other things, authorize the assignment and disclaimer of contracts and the sale of assets, impose and lift stays of proceedings, grant extensions of time, terminate proceedings, and approve creditor proposals (Wood, at pp. 432‑33). Much like arbitration law does for arbitrating parties, Canadian insolvency law thus allows debtors, creditors, and courts “to design a process and [an] outcome that is appropriate for individual . . . cases” (McElcheran, at ¶¶5.11‑5.12).

(c)           Decision Makers With Specialized Expertise

[67]                          Finally, both arbitration law and insolvency law often rely on specialized decision makers to achieve their respective objectives.

[68]                          One “great merit” of arbitration is that parties are able to select a decision maker with “special expertise in the field of their dispute” (3GS Inc. v. Altus Group Ltd., 2011 ONSC 5755, 96 B.L.R. (4th) 268, at para. 19; McEwan and Herbst, at § 4:1).

[69]                          Similarly, specialized judicial expertise is essential to meet the challenges of complex restructuring and insolvency proceedings, often called the “hothouse of real‑time litigation” (Century Services, at para. 58, quoting R. B. Jones, “The Evolution of Canadian Restructuring: Challenges for the Rule of Law”, in J. P. Sarra, ed., Annual Review of Insolvency Law 2005 (2006), 481, at p. 484).

[70]                          The interests of expediency and procedural flexibility inform the need for judicial specialization in the realm of bankruptcy and insolvency. Indeed, in many provinces, there are specialist judges who take carriage of restructuring proceedings and all related issues. Their expertise and “file knowledge” allow them to find the right balance of procedural formality while meeting the need for timely resolution of disputes within the overall restructuring process (McElcheran, at ¶5.85).

[71]                          In sum, reliance on a decision maker with expertise in the relevant field is a core feature of both arbitration law and insolvency law, and for good reason. Specialized expertise can assist in capitalizing on other attributes that are also common to both bodies of law, such as expediency and procedural flexibility.

(d)         Conclusion on the Interplay Between Arbitration Law and Insolvency Law

[72]                          In many cases, the shared interests in expediency, procedural flexibility, and specialized expertise will converge through arbitration. In such a scenario, the parties should be held to their agreement to arbitrate notwithstanding ongoing insolvency proceedings. In other words, the court should grant a stay of legal proceedings in favour of arbitration, and any dispute as to the scope of the arbitration agreement or the arbitrator’s jurisdiction should be left to the arbitrator to resolve. As is evident from the foregoing, valid arbitration agreements are generally to be respected. This presumption in favour of arbitral jurisdiction is supported by this Court’s longstanding jurisprudence, the pro‑arbitration stance adopted in provincial and territorial legislation nationwide, and the foundational principle that contracting parties are free to structure their affairs as they see fit.

[73]                          However, in certain insolvency matters, it may be necessary to preclude arbitration in favour of a centralized judicial process. This may occur when arbitration would compromise the orderly and efficient conduct of a court‑ordered receivership. In such a scenario, a court may assert control over the proceedings, both to ensure the timely resolution of the parties’ dispute and to protect the public interest in the orderly restructuring or dissolution of the debtor and the equal treatment of its creditors. This authority arises from the statutory jurisdiction conferred on superior courts under ss. 243(1) and 183(1) of the BIA.

[74]                          This exercise is necessarily a highly factual one. It requires the court to carefully review the particular statutory regimes and arbitration agreements in play, having regard to the principles of party autonomy and freedom of contract as well as the policy imperatives underpinning bankruptcy and insolvency law.

[75]                          To guide this exercise, I will briefly summarize the two‑part stay framework that is implicit in provincial arbitration legislation like the Arbitration Act.

C.            Two‑Part Framework for Stays of Proceedings in Favour of Arbitration

[76]                          There are two general components to the stay provisions in provincial arbitration legislation across the country. As the framework is similar across jurisdictions, it will be useful to provide a general overview before turning to the interpretation of s. 15 of the Arbitration Act itself. The two components are as follows:

(a)                  the technical prerequisites for a mandatory stay of court proceedings; and

 

(b)                  the statutory exceptions to a mandatory stay of court proceedings.

[77]                          Though interrelated, these two components ought to remain analytically distinct. This distinction is necessary because the burden of proof shifts between the first component and the second.

[78]                          Under the first component, the applicant for a stay in favour of arbitration must establish the technical prerequisites on the applicable standard of proof (McEwan and Herbst, at § 3:43; Hosting Metro Inc. v. Poornam Info Vision Pvt, Ltd., 2016 BCSC 2371, at paras. 29‑30 (CanLII)).

[79]                          If the applicant discharges this burden, then under the second component, the party seeking to avoid arbitration must show that one of the statutory exceptions applies, such that a stay should be refused (McEwan and Herbst, at § 3:43; Casey, at ch. 3.4). Otherwise, the court must grant a stay and cede jurisdiction to the arbitral tribunal.

[80]                          I will briefly elaborate on each component and its respective standard of proof.

(1)         Technical Prerequisites

[81]                          The first component is concerned with whether the applicant for a stay has established that the arbitration agreement at issue engages the mandatory stay provision in the applicable provincial arbitration statute.

[82]                          Considerations at this stage may differ depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the arbitration (i.e., whether it relates to domestic or international arbitration). Broadly speaking, however, this threshold inquiry requires the court to determine whether the party seeking to rely on the arbitration agreement has established the technical prerequisites for a stay in favour of arbitration.

[83]                          There are typically four technical prerequisites relevant at this stage:

(a)                  an arbitration agreement exists;

(b)                  court proceedings have been commenced by a “party” to the arbitration agreement;

(c)                  the court proceedings are in respect of a matter that the parties agreed to submit to arbitration; and

(d)                  the party applying for a stay in favour of arbitration does so before taking any “step” in the court proceedings.

If all the technical prerequisites are met, the mandatory stay provision is engaged and the court should move on to the second component of the analysis.

[84]                          It is important to note that the standard of proof applicable at the first stage is lower than the usual civil standard. To satisfy the first component, the applicant must only establish an “arguable case” that the technical prerequisites are met (McEwan and Herbst, at § 3:47; Sum Trade Corp. v. Agricom International Inc., 2018 BCCA 379, 18 B.C.L.R. (6th) 322, at paras. 26 and 32, citing Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. v. Arochem International Ltd. (1992), 1992 CanLII 4033 (BC CA), 66 B.C.L.R. (2d) 113 (C.A.), at paras. 39‑40).

[85]                          I acknowledge that, in Dell, this Court characterized the applicable standard of proof as that of proof on a “prima facie” basis (para. 82). However, as the Court of Appeal for British Columbia has noted, there is no substantive difference between the arguable case test in Gulf Canada Resources and the prima facie test in Dell:

The significance of both standards is that there is room for a judge to dismiss a stay application when there is no nexus between the claims and the matters reserved for arbitration, while referring to the arbitrator any legitimate question of the scope of the arbitration jurisdiction. This avoids duplication and respects the competence‑competence principle.

 

(Clayworth v. Octaform Systems Inc., 2020 BCCA 117, 446 D.L.R. (4th) 626, at para. 30)

[86]                          Notwithstanding this less onerous standard of proof, court proceedings are not automatically stayed in favour of arbitration where the technical prerequisites are met. Rather, the court must move on to the second component and assess whether any of the statutory exceptions apply (Dell, at para. 87; Clayworth, at paras. 31‑32).

(2)         Statutory Exceptions

[87]                          Certain exceptions, such as whether the arbitration clause is “void, inoperative or incapable of being performed”, arise from the Model Law and the New York Convention and appear in several provincial arbitration statutes, including the Arbitration Act. I will discuss these particular exceptions in the context of this appeal in further detail below. Other statutory exceptions may also be relevant, depending on the jurisdiction (see, e.g., Arbitration Act, 1991, S.O. 1991, c. 17, s. 7(2)).

[88]                          At this second stage, the key question is whether, even though the technical requirements for a stay are met, the party seeking to avoid arbitration has shown on a balance of probabilities that one or more of the statutory exceptions apply. If not, the court must grant a stay. The mandatory nature of stay provisions across jurisdictions in Canada reflects the presumptive validity of arbitration clauses and the principle of party autonomy.

[89]                          It follows that a court should dismiss a stay application on the basis of a statutory exception only in a “clear” case (McEwan and Herbst, at § 3:55; A. J. van den Berg, The New York Arbitration Convention of 1958: Towards a Uniform Judicial Interpretation (1981), at p. 155). A clear case is, for example, one in which the party seeking to avoid arbitration has established on a balance of probabilities that the arbitration agreement is void, inoperative, or incapable of being performed. Where the invalidity or unenforceability of the arbitration agreement is not clear (but merely arguable), the matter should be resolved by the arbitrator. Such an approach accords due respect to arbitral jurisdiction, in light of the competence‑competence principle, as well as to the parties’ intention to refer their disputes to arbitration (McEwan and Herbst, at § 3:55; Dalimpex Ltd. v. Janicki (2000), 137 O.A.C. 390 (S.C.J.), at paras. 3‑5, aff’d (2003), 2003 CanLII 34234 (ON CA), 228 D.L.R. (4th) 179 (C.A.)).

[90]                          As I have indicated, the application of the above two‑part framework in a particular case must begin with a proper interpretation of the governing stay provision. This brings me to the focal point of this appeal: s. 15 of the Arbitration Act.

D.           Section 15 of the Arbitration Act

[91]                          The modern approach to statutory interpretation requires us to read the words of s. 15 in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme and object of the Arbitration Act and the intention of the legislature.

(1)         Text of Section 15

[92]                          The text of s. 15(1) and (2) of the Arbitration Act mirrors the two‑part analytical framework just described. The sections read as follows:

15 (1) If a party to an arbitration agreement commences legal proceedings in a court against another party to the agreement in respect of a matter agreed to be submitted to arbitration, a party to the legal proceedings may apply, before filing a response to civil claim or a response to family claim or taking any other step in the proceedings, to that court to stay the legal proceedings [the technical prerequisites].

 

(2) In an application under subsection (1), the court must make an order staying the legal proceedings unless it determines that the arbitration agreement is void, inoperative or incapable of being performed [the statutory exceptions].

(2)         Proper Interpretation of Section 15

[93]                          The parties disagree on four issues of statutory interpretation regarding s. 15 of the Arbitration Act. Two relate to the technical prerequisites set out in s. 15(1):

(a)                  whether undertaking to file a defence constitutes a “step in the proceedings”; and

(b)                  whether a court‑appointed receiver may be a “party” to a debtor’s arbitration agreement.

[94]                          The other two relate to the statutory exceptions provided for in s. 15(2):

(c)                  whether a receiver’s purported disclaimer of an arbitration agreement renders it “void, inoperative or incapable of being performed”; and

(d)                  whether the Arbitration Act permits a court to find an arbitration agreement “inoperative” or “incapable of being performed” due to a receivership.

[95]                          All four interpretive issues must be resolved before s. 15 is applied to the case at bar.

(a)           Section 15(1) — Undertaking to File a Defence Is Not a “Step in the Proceedings”

[96]                          First, the Receiver resurrects its submission before the chambers judge that undertaking to file a defence may constitute a “step in the proceedings” within the meaning of s. 15(1). This proposed interpretation was explicitly rejected by the chambers judge and not pursued before the Court of Appeal.

[97]                          Determining whether a step in the proceedings has been taken requires an objective approach. The court must ask itself whether, on the facts, the party should be held impliedly to have affirmed the correctness of the proceedings and its willingness to go along with a determination by a court of law instead of arbitration (McEwan and Herbst, at § 3:27). A step in the proceedings means “something in the nature of an application to the Court, and not mere talk between solicitors . . . nor the writing of letters” (Larc Developments, at para. 15, citing Ives & Barker v. Willans, [1894] 2 Ch. 478 (C.A.), at p. 484).

[98]                          I acknowledge that the Receiver now argues in this Court, for the first time, that requesting the other party’s consent to an extension of time to file a defence constitutes a step in the proceedings. Assuming, without deciding, that this submission is properly before our Court, I reject it. In my view, requesting an extension of time cannot be considered a “step”. In the context of s. 15(1), the very purpose of such a request is to decide whether or not to take a step, and there is no election to proceed with the action (McEwan and Herbst, at § 3:31). Indeed, the result of an extension “might well be quite to the contrary, and have the effect of removing [the action] entirely from the Court” (Central Investments & Development Corp. v. Miller (1982), 1982 CanLII 3029 (PE SCTD), 133 D.L.R. (3d) 440 (P.E.I.S.C.), at p. 442).

[99]                          In sum, I see no merit in the interpretation of the words “step in the proceedings” proposed by the Receiver.

(b)         Section 15(1) — A Court‑Appointed Receiver May Be a “Party” to an Arbitration Agreement

[100]                     The second interpretive issue concerns the term “party” in s. 15(1) of the Arbitration Act. Can a court‑appointed receiver be a party to the debtor’s pre‑existing arbitration agreement?

[101]                     The Receiver says no. It agrees with the Court of Appeal that a court‑appointed receiver cannot be a party because it is a legal entity separate from the debtor with a fiduciary duty to the appointing court.

[102]                     Peace River disagrees. It says that a court‑appointed receiver, like other non‑signatories, may be a party to the debtor’s pre‑receivership arbitration agreement through the operation of ordinary contract law.

[103]                     I agree with Peace River. I say this for three reasons.

(i)            Ordinary Contractual Principles Indicate That a Receiver May Be a “Party” to an Arbitration Agreement

[104]                     First, the Receiver’s narrow interpretation of the term “party” conflicts with basic principles of contract law. It says that a receiver may advance claims only through the debtor in exercising its power to institute proceedings for the benefit of all stakeholders in an insolvent corporation. It further says that s. 15(1) of the Arbitration Act must be interpreted in light of the fact that in 1986 the reference to a person claiming “through” a party to an arbitration agreement was removed from the stay provision in the province’s domestic arbitration legislation. The provision — now s. 15(1) of the Arbitration Act — thus differs from s. 2(1) of the province’s International Commercial Arbitration Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 233 (“ICAA”), which defines “party” as including “a person claiming through or under a party” to an arbitration agreement. The Receiver asks this Court to give effect to the “narrower wording” in the Arbitration Act and the “important textual distinction” between the Arbitration Act and the ICAA (R.F., at paras. 89‑90).

[105]                     I disagree. The interpretation of the term “party” under arbitration legislation falls to be “determined in accordance with the ordinary principles for construction of a contract” (McEwan and Herbst, at § 2:28; Casey, at ch. 3.5.1). It is well established that an entity connected with a signatory to a contract containing an arbitration agreement may become bound as a “party” by operation of law. Such associated entities may include “subsidiaries, assignees, trustees and others claiming through or under the named party to the arbitration agreement” (McEwan and Herbst, at § 2:37 (emphasis added)). These entities, although non‑signatories, “may have all of the rights and obligations under the arbitration agreement by operation of law” (Casey, at ch. 3.5.1).

[106]                     Two examples are instructive here. The first is assignment. It is a “fundamental” and “universal commercial legal principle” that an assignor may not assign contractual rights in such a way as to “convey the benefits and nullify the burdens”. Stated differently, a party seeking to enforce assigned rights under an agreement “can only do so subject to the terms and conditions therein”, including the condition that disputes are to be resolved by arbitration (ABN Amro Bank Canada v. Krupp Mak Maschinenbau GmbH (1996), 1996 CanLII 12449 (ON SCDC), 135 D.L.R. (4th) 130 (Ont. C.J. (Gen. Div.)); see also Casey, at ch. 3.5.1; Petro‑Canada v. 366084 Ontario Ltd. (1995), 1995 CanLII 7418 (ON SC), 25 B.L.R. (2d) 19 (Ont. C.J. (Gen. Div.)), at para. 55).

[107]                     The second example is trusteeship in bankruptcy. When a trustee in bankruptcy adopts a contract containing an arbitration clause and a dispute later arises, “the arbitration agreement is enforceable by or against the trustee in the same manner as any other commercial contract adopted by the trustee” (Casey, at ch. 3.8.2).

[108]                     In both of these scenarios, a non‑signatory “steps into the shoes of the original contracting party” and thereby becomes “bound by the terms of the contract to which he or she has succeeded as a trustee in bankruptcy . . . or assignee” (A. Swan, J. Adamski and A. Y. Na, Canadian Contract Law (4th ed. 2018), at §3.10).

[109]                     I see no principled reason why the foregoing should not apply, mutatis mutandis, to a court‑appointed receiver claiming through a debtor under a contract containing an arbitration agreement. I agree with the Receiver that it “advances claims through [Petrowest and] the Petrowest [Affiliates]” (R.F., at para. 59 (emphasis added)). Indeed, a court‑appointed receiver, by initiating legal proceedings on behalf of a debtor, “steps into the shoes” of the debtor as the original contracting party, much like an assignee or a trustee in bankruptcy does. While a court‑appointed receiver may have the power to sue on the debtor’s behalf, “the receiver acquires no cause of action in its own name” and therefore “must . . . sue in the debtor’s name to recover accounts receivable” (Bennett, at p. 257). In short, a court‑appointed receiver has no independent cause of action to assert. It may only rely on the debtor’s rights to recover, for example, accounts receivable owed by a third party. It would violate basic principles of contract law to permit a receiver to enforce a contract on the debtor’s behalf while avoiding the debtor’s burdens, including the obligation to arbitrate contractual disputes.

[110]                     Nor am I persuaded that a receiver’s duty as an officer of the court precludes it from being considered a party to an arbitration agreement within the meaning of s. 15(1) of the Arbitration Act. To the contrary, a court‑appointed receiver owes a fiduciary duty to “all interested parties involving the debtor’s assets, property, and undertaking” (Bennett, at p. 38 (emphasis added)). For this reason, the receiver may not “arbitrarily” break contracts entered into by the debtor with third parties prior to the receivership. Rather, the receiver must exercise “proper discretion in doing so”, including by seeking “leave of the court” to terminate such contracts (Bennett, at p. 434). This supports my view that a receiver’s court‑appointed role cannot insulate it from being considered a party under s. 15(1) where the contractual principles outlined above apply.

(ii)         Interpretive Principles Confirm That a Receiver May Be a “Party” to an Arbitration Agreement

[111]                     Second, I reject the Receiver’s argument that, by not referring in s. 15(1) of the Arbitration Act to a person claiming through or under a party to an arbitration agreement, the legislature intended to preclude non‑signatories like receivers from being considered parties under that section. This interpretation would be inconsistent with two applicable principles of statutory interpretation.

[112]                     The first principle is that where legislation does not fully address a matter relating to its subject, courts may look to the common law to interpret the statutory language (R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at §17.02). In such a scenario, the common law is presumed to apply, absent persuasive evidence that the legislature intended to change or displace it by enacting the statute at issue (Sullivan, at §17.02).

[113]                     The Arbitration Act does not define the term “party”. I acknowledge that the reference to a person claiming through a party to an arbitration agreement was removed from the stay provision in domestic arbitration legislation. But if this Court accepted the Receiver’s proposed interpretation, no non‑signatory could ever be a party to an arbitration agreement under the Arbitration Act. This is because all non‑signatories, whether they are agents, trustees in bankruptcy, receivers, or assignees, may claim only through or under a signatory, upon stepping into its contractual shoes. Such an interpretation would plainly undermine these foundational contractual doctrines. I see nothing in the legislative record or the text of the Arbitration Act to indicate that the legislature intended to change or displace the common law in such a radical manner.

[114]                     The second principle is that statutes such as the Arbitration Act and the ICAA must be interpreted harmoniously. As Gonthier J. held in Therrien (Re), 2001 SCC 35, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 3, “[i]nterpretations favouring harmony between the various statutes enacted by the same government should indeed prevail. This presumption is even stronger when the statutes relate to the same subject matter” (para. 121; see also Sullivan, at §13.04).

[115]                     This presumption further undermines the Receiver’s proposed interpretation of the term “party”. I do not accept that the removal of the reference to a person claiming through a party to an arbitration agreement from the stay provision in domestic arbitration legislation reflects a legislative intent to exclude all entities claiming through or under a party. The ICAA was passed concurrently with the Arbitration Act by the same legislature to deal with the same subject matter. The ICAA thus provides useful interpretive guidance in ascertaining the scope of the term “party” in the Arbitration Act. The term should be interpreted harmoniously under both statutes. In other words, a “party” under s. 15(1) of the Arbitration Act includes “a person claiming through or under a party”, in accordance with the definition in s. 2(1) of the ICAA. As I explained above, this may include a court‑appointed receiver claiming through or under a debtor.

(iii)      Interpreting the Term “Party” as Including a Court‑Appointed Receiver Claiming Through or Under a Debtor Is Consistent With a Central Purpose of the Arbitration Act

[116]                     Finally, accepting the Receiver’s interpretation would be inconsistent with a central purpose of the Arbitration Act: ensuring that parties abide by valid arbitration agreements.

[117]                     Indeed, the interpretation urged on us by the Receiver could effectively prevent arbitration of any dispute as soon as one of the contracting parties entered receivership. This would subvert the core arbitral principles of party autonomy, limited court intervention, and competence‑competence. Most notably, commercial parties seeking to mitigate risk through arbitration agreements would be deprived of the dispute resolution mechanism they bargained for when they arguably need it the most: when their counterparty cannot meet its obligations due to insolvency. I decline to make such a wide‑ranging finding.

[118]                     Accordingly, I conclude that a court‑appointed receiver may be a party within the meaning of s. 15(1) of the Arbitration Act by claiming through or under a party to a valid arbitration agreement. In short, a receiver, like other non‑signatories, may become bound by an arbitration agreement in accordance with ordinary principles of contract law.

(c)         Section 15(2) — Disclaimer Cannot Render an Arbitration Agreement “Void, Inoperative or Incapable of Being Performed”

[119]                     The third interpretive issue flows from the second. If a court‑appointed receiver can be a party to a debtor’s pre‑existing arbitration agreement, can it nevertheless avoid the obligation to arbitrate by initiating court proceedings under the main contract? In other words, can a receiver unilaterally disclaim an arbitration agreement, thereby rendering it “void, inoperative or incapable of being performed” within the meaning of s. 15(2) of the Arbitration Act?

[120]                     The Court of Appeal appeared to answer this question in the affirmative. It concluded that, even if a court‑appointed receiver could be a party to a debtor’s arbitration agreement, it would have the power to disclaim that agreement by commencing court proceedings and thereby render an otherwise valid arbitration agreement void, inoperative, or incapable of being performed within the meaning of s. 15(2). The Receiver endorses the Court of Appeal’s reasoning.

[121]                     In my respectful view, the Court of Appeal erred in its interpretation of s. 15(2), for two reasons.

[122]                     First, the Court of Appeal’s analysis rested on a palpable and overriding error. The Receiver conceded before the Court of Appeal, as it does in this Court, that it “has not expressly disclaimed” the Arbitration Agreements (R.F., at para. 102; A.F., Appendix B, at paras. 3 and 13). During the oral hearing before this Court, counsel for the Receiver reiterated this concession. Thus, the Receiver has not disclaimed the Arbitration Agreements by commencing court proceedings. Therefore, the Court of Appeal’s interpretation of s. 15(2) cannot stand.

[123]                     Second, and even setting the Court of Appeal’s factual error aside, I agree with Peace River that a receiver’s unilateral disclaimer cannot render an arbitration agreement void, inoperative, or incapable of being performed. In Seidel, LeBel and Deschamps JJ. (dissenting, but not on this point) held that the terms “void”, “inoperative”, and “incapable of being performed” in s. 15(2) should be interpreted “narrowly” to prevent parties from avoiding arbitration in favour of what they view as a “preferable procedure” (paras. 117‑18). I agree with the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (Canada) Inc. that allowing a receiver to avoid arbitration by unilaterally disclaiming a debtor’s pre‑existing arbitration agreement conflicts with the text and intent of s. 15 and “diminishes the presumptive enforceability and overall predictability of arbitration agreements, which was the purpose for Canada ratifying the New York Convention and for British Columbia adopting the Model Law” (I.F., at para. 9).

[124]                     As s. 15(2) makes plain, the sole basis upon which a party may sue to enforce a contract and yet avoid the obligation to arbitrate is that the arbitration agreement has been found by a court to be void, inoperative, or incapable of being performed. Preferably, court‑appointed receivers should seek such a judicial determination by bringing a motion for directions before the supervising court (see, e.g., Canada (Attorney General) v. Reliance Insurance Co. (2007), 2007 CanLII 41899 (ON SC), 87 O.R. (3d) 42 (S.C.J.), at paras. 7, 9 and 21). I note that the Receiver did not bring such a motion before the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench, the supervising court with carriage of this matter. Instead, it filed a civil claim in the Supreme Court of British Columbia. Contrary to the Court of Appeal’s reasoning, I do not accept that the bare act of filing suit in a court unfamiliar with the insolvency proceedings is a sufficient basis on which to find an arbitration agreement unenforceable under s. 15(2). Given the clear expression of legislative will in favour of arbitral jurisdiction embodied in the Arbitration Act, the enforceability of an otherwise valid arbitration agreement should not be subject to the whims of any single party, even a court‑appointed receiver.

[125]                     Rather, where a court‑appointed receiver attempts to initiate court proceedings without prior judicial approval in a dispute covered by a valid arbitration agreement, the court must decide whether to exercise its jurisdiction arising from the BIA to decline to enforce the arbitration agreement under s. 15 of the Arbitration Act. This requires a proper reading of the words “void, inoperative or incapable of being performed” in accordance with the modern approach to statutory interpretation and in light of the relevant insolvency policy interests. The Court of Appeal did not set out its reasoning in this regard. Accordingly, I turn now to this interpretive exercise.

(d)         Section 15(2) — A Court May Find an Arbitration Agreement “Inoperative” Due to a Receivership

[126]                     The final interpretive issue lies at the heart of this appeal. It boils down to the following question: Where the technical prerequisites in s. 15(1) of the Arbitration Act are met, does s. 15(2) give a court the power to refuse a stay under s. 15(2) by finding that an arbitration agreement has become “inoperative” or “incapable of being performed” because of court‑ordered receivership proceedings?

[127]                     According to Peace River, the answer is no. It accepts that s. 15(2) requires a court to assess whether an arbitration agreement is “void, inoperative or incapable of being performed”. However, it argues that these terms must be narrowly interpreted and that courts do not have the power to “simply render” otherwise valid arbitration agreements inoperative or incapable of being performed, whether by virtue of their statutory jurisdiction over receiverships under s. 243 of the BIA or by virtue of the inherent jurisdiction to oversee bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings preserved in s. 183 of the BIA. Peace River says that even if such a power existed under the BIA, it would conflict with s. 15 of the Arbitration Act, thus creating a paramountcy conflict between federal legislation and provincial legislation, which the Receiver fails to address.

[128]                     The Receiver takes a more nuanced view. It agrees with Peace River that there was no need for the chambers judge to rely on inherent jurisdiction. Instead, it argues that s. 15(2) of the Arbitration Act grants a court the authority, in certain circumstances, to find an otherwise valid arbitration clause inoperative or incapable of being performed in the context of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. It says that this power is “also founded” in a court’s statutory jurisdiction pursuant to ss. 183(1) and 243 of the BIA (R.F., at para. 118). Since s. 15 expressly authorizes a court to decline a stay in favour of arbitration on the basis that an arbitration agreement is inoperative or incapable of being performed, there is no conflict between federal law and provincial law to be resolved through the doctrine of federal paramountcy. This submission was endorsed by several interveners in this appeal, including the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators and the Insolvency Institute of Canada.

[129]                     I agree with the Receiver and the above‑noted interveners. A court may find an arbitration agreement inoperative where arbitration would compromise the orderly and efficient resolution of a receivership. Accordingly, there is no conflict between the provincial Arbitration Act and the federal BIA giving rise to paramountcy concerns.

[130]                     As I will explain, this interpretation is supported by (a) the text, scheme, and purposes of the Arbitration Act; (b) the judicial and academic treatment of the term “inoperative”; and (c) the broad statutory jurisdiction conferred on superior courts in bankruptcy and insolvency matters, such as court‑ordered receiverships under s. 243 of the BIA. I will then conclude by outlining several non‑exhaustive factors to guide courts in determining whether an arbitration agreement is inoperative due to parallel bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings.

(i)            The Text, Scheme, and Purposes of the Arbitration Act Permit Courts to Find Arbitration Agreements “Inoperative” in the Insolvency Context

[131]                     When the modern approach to statutory interpretation is applied, it is clear that courts have the power to decline a stay in favour of arbitration under s. 15(2) of the Arbitration Act even where all the technical prerequisites in s. 15(1) are met.

[132]                     Both Peace River and the Receiver agree that, plainly read, s. 15(2) requires a court to assess whether an arbitration agreement is “void, inoperative or incapable of being performed” before granting a stay in favour of arbitration. This language is drawn from the Model Law, art. 8(1) of which states that a court “shall” refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that the arbitration agreement is “null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed”. Similar language is also found in art. II(3) of the New York Convention. This language is commonly understood as requiring the court to pronounce upon the validity and enforceability of the arbitration agreement before referring the dispute to the arbitrator (McEwan and Herbst, at § 3:55, citing Heyman v. Darwins, Ld., [1942] A.C. 356 (H.L.); Kaverit Steel and Crane Ltd. v. Kone Corp. (1992), 1992 ABCA 7 (CanLII), 87 D.L.R. (4th) 129 (Alta. C.A.)).

[133]                     That said, courts must be careful not to overstep their role on a stay application under s. 15. They must bear in mind the competence‑competence principle, the intention of the parties to refer their disputes to arbitration, and the legislative purposes underlying the Arbitration Act. As I have noted, the text and scheme of s. 15 make it mandatory for a court to defer to arbitral jurisdiction where the technical prerequisites in s. 15(1) are met, subject only to the narrow statutory exceptions in s. 15(2). This deferential approach accords with the purposes of the Arbitration Act, which were identified by the enacting legislature as follows: (a) providing a “simpler, faster, less expensive and less formal process” for resolving disputes, thereby minimizing costly and time‑consuming court procedures; and (b) limiting judicial review in respect of disputes that parties have agreed to resolve by arbitration (British Columbia, Official Report of Debates of the Legislative Assembly (Hansard), vol. 16, No. 7, 4th Sess., 33rd Parl., April 21, 1986, at p. 7865 (Hon. Brian Smith, Attorney General)).

[134]                     In the typical case, both legislative objectives will be served by holding the parties to their agreement to arbitrate. Indeed, a narrow interpretation of the words “void, inoperative or incapable of being performed” promotes the enforcement of arbitration agreements, which generally leads to streamlined dispute resolution with minimal judicial intervention (see Seidel, at para. 117; S. Kröll, “The ‘Incapable of Being Performed’ Exception in Article II(3) of the New York Convention”, in E. Gaillard, D. Di Pietro and N. Leleu‑Knobil, eds., Enforcement of Arbitration Agreements and International Arbitral Awards: The New York Convention in Practice (2008), 323, at p. 324).

[135]                     But when do these narrow statutory exceptions apply? The terms “void”, “inoperative”, and “incapable of being performed” are not defined in the Arbitration Act, nor in the Model Law or the New York Convention from which they originate. It is therefore necessary to briefly define each term.

1.            “Void”

[136]                     The meaning of the term “void” is relatively settled. An arbitration agreement will be considered void only in the rare circumstances where it is “intrinsically defective” (and therefore void ab initio) according to the usual rules of contract law, including when it is undermined by fraud, undue influence, unconscionability, duress, mistake, or misrepresentation (C. B. Lamm and J. K. Sharpe, “Inoperative Arbitration Agreements Under the New York Convention”, in E. Gaillard, D. Di Pietro and N. Leleu‑Knobil, eds., Enforcement of Arbitration Agreements and International Arbitral Awards: The New York Convention in Practice (2008), 297, at p. 300; McEwan and Herbst, at § 3:56; Casey, at ch. 3.7.1). The Supreme Court of British Columbia has confirmed that the term “void” in s. 15(2) of the Arbitration Act provides a court with a narrow discretion to decline a stay where there are “sufficient materials before the court on which to base a summary determination that the arbitration agreement itself is void” on one or more of the recognized grounds (James v. Thow, 2005 BCSC 809, 5 B.L.R. (4th) 315, at para. 99). There is no dispute that the Arbitration Agreements in the present case are not void within the meaning of s. 15(2).

2.            “Inoperative”

[137]                     Less settled — and more significant to the case at bar — is the proper interpretation of the terms “inoperative” and “incapable of being performed”, particularly in the context of a bankruptcy or insolvency. I turn first to the meaning of “inoperative”.

[138]                     The term “inoperative” has no universal common law definition (Prince George (City) v. McElhanney Engineering Services Ltd. (1995), 1995 CanLII 2487 (BC CA), 9 B.C.L.R. (3d) 368 (C.A.), at para. 33, citing M. J. Mustill and S. C. Boyd, The Law and Practice of Commercial Arbitration in England (2nd ed. 1989), at pp. 464‑65). In arbitration law, however, the term has been used to describe arbitration agreements which, although not void ab initio, “have ceased for some reason to have future effect” or “have become inapplicable to the parties and their dispute” (McEwan and Herbst, at § 3:57; Lamm and Sharpe, at p. 301; see also Casey, at ch. 3.7.2).

[139]                     Possible reasons for finding an arbitration agreement inoperative include frustration, discharge by breach, waiver, or a subsequent agreement between the parties. The cases interpreting s. 15(2) of the Arbitration Act make it clear that matters such as inconvenience, multiple parties, intertwining of issues with non‑arbitrable disputes, possible increased cost, and potential delay generally will not, standing alone, be grounds to find an arbitration agreement inoperative (Prince George, at para. 37; MacKinnon v. National Money Mart Co., 2004 BCCA 473, 50 B.L.R. (3d) 291, at para. 34). Indeed, like all the statutory exceptions, the exception for an inoperative arbitration agreement is to be narrowly interpreted, with the party seeking to avoid arbitration bearing the heavy onus of showing that it applies. This serves “the interests of freedom of contract, international comity and expected efficiency and cost‑savings” from enforcing otherwise valid arbitration agreements (McEwan and Herbst, at § 3:57; MacKinnon, at para. 36).

[140]                     The application of this exception where the defendant in litigation that has been commenced is subject to bankruptcy or insolvency protection is straightforward. For instance, the making of a winding‑up order or a receivership order may be grounds for a court to find an arbitration agreement inoperative (Casey, at ch. 7.18.2; McEwan and Herbst, at § 3:57). Indeed, in either scenario, all proceedings against the debtor are stayed under the applicable bankruptcy or insolvency legislation. Accordingly, an agreement to arbitrate ceases, in most circumstances, to have effect for the future and may not be relied upon. It is inoperative, and the matter is left to be resolved in the relevant bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings.

[141]                     This is not to say that a court must decline a stay in favour of arbitration based on inoperability in these circumstances. As Casey notes, it “may well be that the bankruptcy judge will refer the matter to arbitration as the most expeditious way to prove the creditor’s claim” (ch. 7.18.2). As I will explain further below, the court must assess, in light of all the circumstances, whether to refer the matter to arbitration or to maintain centralized judicial oversight.

[142]                     It must be noted, however, that the term “inoperative” may not always cover scenarios where a court‑appointed creditor representative, like a receiver, initiates court proceedings on behalf of a debtor. This is because insolvency law generally stays legal claims brought against a debtor under court protection, while permitting claims brought on its behalf to proceed, in the interest of maximizing creditor recovery and salvaging the debtor’s business as a going concern. Again, in these circumstances, the court must assess whether to permit the receiver to proceed with the debtor’s claim in court rather than through the arbitral process bargained for by the parties.

[143]                     A helpful example of inoperability in the insolvency context is provided by Reliance. In that case, a liquidator appointed under the Winding‑up and Restructuring Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. W‑11 (“WURA”), initiated court proceedings to collect monies allegedly owed to the debtor by third parties. The third parties invoked their arbitration agreements with the debtor and asked the court to refer the dispute to arbitration. Pepall J. (as she then was) concluded that, in these circumstances, the arbitration agreements ceased to have future effect and were inoperative within the meaning of the applicable arbitration legislation. To hold otherwise would have compromised the “expeditious and inexpensive” resolution of the insolvency proceedings, contrary to the WURA (para. 34). Pepall J. observed that referral to arbitration would result in undue delay given the “three separate adjudications” that would be required under the arbitration agreements, and also pointed to the “attendant danger of inconsistent rulings” (para. 34).

3.            “Incapable of Being Performed”

[144]                     An arbitration agreement is considered “incapable of being performed” where “the arbitral process cannot effectively be set in motion” because of a physical or legal impediment beyond the parties’ control (McEwan and Herbst, at § 3:58; Casey, at ch. 3.7.3; Prince George, at para. 35; Lamm and Sharpe, at p. 300; Kröll, at p. 326; van den Berg, at p. 159; D. Schramm, E. Geisinger and P. Pinsolle, “Article II”, in H. Kronke et al., eds., Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards: A Global Commentary on the New York Convention (2010), 37, at p. 108).

[145]                     Physical impediments rendering an arbitration agreement incapable of being performed may include the following: (a) inconsistencies, inherent contradictions, or vagueness in the arbitration agreement that cannot be remedied by interpretation or other contractual techniques; (b) the non‑availability of the arbitrator specified in the agreement; (c) the dissolution or non‑existence of the chosen arbitration institution; or (d) political or other circumstances at the seat of arbitration rendering arbitration impossible (McEwan and Herbst, at § 3:58; Casey, at ch. 3.7.3; van den Berg, at p. 159; Kröll, at pp. 330‑42). In all these circumstances, the arbitration agreement is incapable of being performed because it is impossible for the parties to obtain the specific arbitral procedures for which they bargained. Importantly, financial impecuniosity alone does not render an arbitration agreement incapable of being performed (D. St. John Sutton, J. Gill and M. Gearing, Russell on Arbitration (24th ed. 2015), at p. 379; Casey, at ch. 3.5.1; D. Joseph, Jurisdiction and Arbitration Agreements and Their Enforcement (2nd ed. 2010), at p. 355). Legal impediments may also lead to an incapacity to perform an arbitration agreement. For example, an arbitration agreement may be incapable of being performed because the subject matter of the dispute is covered by an express legislative override of the parties’ right to arbitrate (see Seidel, at para. 40).

(ii)         The BIA Provides Jurisdiction to Find an Arbitration Agreement “Inoperative”

[146]                     The broad and flexible powers granted to superior courts under the BIA, particularly in the receivership context, provide further support for the foregoing interpretation of s. 15(2) of the Arbitration Act. The Arbitration Act and the BIA are not incompatible, such that no paramountcy concerns arise.

[147]                     The BIA is remedial legislation that is intended, in part, to provide for an orderly and efficient distribution of a bankrupt’s funds to various creditors. As such, it is to be given a liberal interpretation in order to facilitate its objectives (Century Services, at para. 15; Third Eye Capital Corporation v. Dianor Resources Inc., 2019 ONCA 508, 435 D.L.R. (4th) 416, at para. 43). Section 183(1) of the BIA confirms that superior courts have jurisdiction in bankruptcy and insolvency matters which may be exercised concurrently with their jurisdiction in ordinary civil matters (Houlden, Morawetz and Sarra, at § 8:2; Cantore v. Nemaska Lithium Inc., 2020 QCCA 1333, at para. 8 (CanLII)).

[148]                     Further, under s. 243(1)(c) of the BIA, a court may appoint a receiver to, among other things, “take any . . . action that the court considers advisable”, if the court considers it “just or convenient to do so”. This very expansive wording has been interpreted as giving judges the “broadest possible mandate in insolvency proceedings to enable them to react to any circumstances that may arise” in relation to court‑ordered receiverships (DGDP-BC Holdings Ltd. v. Third Eye Capital Corporation, 2021 ABCA 226, 459 D.L.R. (4th) 538, at para. 20; see also Houlden, Morawetz and Sarra, at § 12:18; Dianor, at paras. 57‑58). Section 243(1)(c) thus permits a court to do not only what “justice dictates” but also what “practicality demands” (Dianor, at para. 57; Canada (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development) v. Curragh Inc. (1994), 1994 CanLII 7468 (ON SC), 114 D.L.R. (4th) 176 (Ont. C.J. (Gen. Div.)), at p. 185).

[149]                     In my view, practicality demands that a court have the ability, in limited circumstances, to decline to enforce an arbitration agreement following a commercial insolvency. Said differently, ss. 243(1)(c) and 183(1) provide a statutory basis on which a court may, in certain circumstances, find an arbitration agreement inoperative within the meaning of s. 15(2) of the Arbitration Act.

[150]                     Peace River resists this interpretation, relying on s. 72(1) of the BIA as interpreted by this Court in GMAC Commercial Credit Corp. — Canada v. T.C.T. Logistics Inc., 2006 SCC 35, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 123. In short, it argues that s. 243(1)(c) of the BIA cannot empower a court to find an arbitration agreement unenforceable, as this would “abrogate” a contracting party’s substantive right to a stay in favour of arbitration under s. 15 of the Arbitration Act, contrary to s. 72(1) of the BIA.

[151]                     I disagree. Section 72(1) merely confirms the constitutional doctrine of federal paramountcy, affirming that the BIA prevails where there is a “genuine inconsistency” between provincial laws relating to property and civil rights and the BIA (Moloney, at para. 40). It is well established that harmonious interpretations of federal and provincial legislation should be favoured over interpretations that result in incompatibility (Orphan Well Association v. Grant Thornton Ltd., 2019 SCC 5, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 150, at paras. 64 and 66). Peace River’s proposed interpretation of s. 72(1) of the BIA overlooks the fact that a party’s “right” to have its dispute referred to arbitration under s. 15 of the Arbitration Act arises only where the court finds that the arbitration agreement at issue is not void, inoperative, or incapable of being performed. I have already explained that the statutory exception for inoperability may apply in certain insolvency scenarios. In other words, there is no “genuine inconsistency” between the Arbitration Act and the BIA. I therefore agree with both Peace River and the Receiver that the paramountcy doctrine is not engaged.

[152]                     Accordingly, I find that there is statutory jurisdiction arising from ss. 183(1) and 243(1)(c) of the BIA for a court to hold that an arbitration agreement is inoperative in the receivership context. It is therefore unnecessary in this case to resort to inherent jurisdiction, which is to be considered only after statutory jurisdiction is determined to be unavailable (Endean v. British Columbia, 2016 SCC 42, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 162, at para. 24; G. R. Jackson and J. Sarra, “Selecting the Judicial Tool to get the Job Done: An Examination of Statutory Interpretation, Discretionary Power and Inherent Jurisdiction in Insolvency Matters”, in J. P. Sarra, ed., Annual Review of Insolvency Law 2007 (2008), 41).

[153]                     In sum, the foregoing interpretation of s. 15(2) of the Arbitration Act recognizes that the legislative and judicial preference for the enforcement of arbitration agreements is not set in stone. Rather, in limited circumstances, the BIA provides courts with jurisdiction to find an arbitration agreement inoperative in the face of parallel insolvency proceedings.

[154]                     I will now consider how to ascertain whether an otherwise valid arbitration agreement is inoperative in the context of insolvency proceedings. To date, this question has not been directly addressed by our Court. I will therefore briefly outline a set of factors arising from the authorities reviewed above that may be relevant in this exercise.

(iii)      Factors for Assessing Whether an Arbitration Agreement Is “Inoperative” Under Section 15(2) of the Arbitration Act Due to Insolvency Proceedings

[155]                     As I have explained, a court may find an arbitration agreement “inoperative” within the meaning of s. 15(2) of the Arbitration Act where enforcing it would compromise the orderly and efficient resolution of insolvency proceedings, including a court‑ordered receivership under s. 243 of the BIA. The following non‑exhaustive list of factors may be relevant in determining whether a particular arbitration agreement is inoperative in this context:

(a)                  The effect of arbitration on the integrity of the insolvency proceedings. Party autonomy and freedom of contract must be balanced with the need for an orderly and equitable distribution of the debtor’s assets to creditors. An arbitration agreement may therefore be inoperative if it would lead to an arbitral process that would compromise the objective of the insolvency proceedings, namely the orderly and expeditious administration of the debtor’s property. The court should have regard to the role and expertise of the court‑appointed creditor representative, if any, in managing the insolvency proceedings.

 

(b)                  The relative prejudice to the parties from the referral of the dispute to arbitration. The court should override the parties’ agreement to arbitrate their dispute only where the benefit of doing so outweighs the prejudice to them.

 

(c)                  The urgency of resolving the dispute. The court should generally prefer the more expeditious procedure. If the effect of a stay in favour of arbitration would be to postpone the resolution of the dispute and hinder the insolvency proceedings, this militates in favour of a finding of inoperability.

 

(d)                  The applicability of a stay of proceedings under bankruptcy or insolvency law. Bankruptcy or insolvency legislation may impose a stay that precludes any proceedings, including arbitral proceedings, against the debtor. If such a stay applies, the debtor cannot rely on an arbitration agreement to avoid the bankruptcy or insolvency; the agreement becomes inoperative.

 

(e)                  Any other factor the court considers material in the circumstances.

[156]                     Each of the foregoing factors may carry more or less weight depending on the circumstances of the case. But it bears repeating that the party seeking to avoid arbitration bears a heavy onus to establish a clear case of inoperability or incapacity to perform the impugned arbitration agreement. To discharge this onus, it must prove on a balance of probabilities that one or more of the statutory exceptions set out in s. 15(2) of the Arbitration Act apply. Otherwise, the court must grant a stay in favour of arbitration.

(e)           Conclusion on Section 15

[157]                     In sum, a proper interpretation of s. 15 of the Arbitration Act leads to the following conclusions:

•                        The chambers judge was correct that undertaking to file a defence without invoking the rules of court is not a “step in the proceedings” within the meaning of s. 15(1);

•                        The chambers judge was correct that a court‑appointed receiver may be a “party” to a debtor’s pre‑existing arbitration agreement within the meaning of s. 15(1);

•                        The Court of Appeal erred in holding that a court‑appointed receiver may disclaim an arbitration agreement and thereby render it “void, inoperative or incapable of being performed” within the meaning of s. 15(2); and

•                        The chambers judge was correct that she had the authority to find an arbitration agreement inoperative in light of bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings. This power arises from the broad statutory jurisdiction accorded to superior courts in bankruptcy and insolvency matters by ss. 183 and 243 of the BIA. A court may find an arbitration agreement inoperative where the arbitral proceedings bargained for by the parties would compromise the orderly and efficient resolution of a receivership.

[158]                     In light of these interpretive conclusions, I now apply the two‑part stay analysis under s. 15 of the Arbitration Act to the facts of the case at bar.

E.            Application of Section 15 of the Arbitration Act

(1)         Technical Prerequisites: Section 15 Is Engaged

[159]                     At the first stage of the stay analysis, the party seeking to rely on the arbitration agreement must establish an arguable case that all the technical prerequisites contemplated in s. 15(1) are met.

[160]                     There is no dispute that two of the technical prerequisites are met in this case: the Arbitration Agreements exist, and the impugned civil proceedings are in respect of a contractual dispute covered by them.

[161]                     I conclude that Peace River has also established an arguable case that the remaining technical prerequisites are met: (a) the Receiver is a “party” to the Arbitration Agreements, contrary to the Court of Appeal’s conclusion; and (b) Peace River did not take a “step in the proceedings”.

(a)           The Receiver Is a “Party” to the Arbitration Agreements

[162]                     It is at least arguable that the Receiver is a party to the Arbitration Agreements. I say this for the following reasons.

[163]                     First, the Receiver would have no cause of action to assert without Petrowest or the Petrowest Affiliates. The Court of Appeal recognized that “nominally, the claims remain those of Petrowest and its affiliates” (para. 43). In other words, the Receiver stepped into their shoes by initiating a civil claim on their behalf. Similarly to an assignee or a trustee in bankruptcy, the Receiver arguably became bound by operation of law by claiming through or under Petrowest and the Petrowest Affiliates. As I explained above, a receiver should not be permitted to seek the benefits of a contract in the debtor’s name while avoiding the burdens.

[164]                     Second, contrary to the submissions of both Peace River and the Receiver, the distinction between a trustee in bankruptcy and a receiver is immaterial here. Under para. 3(j) of the Receivership Order, the Receiver is authorized to bring a civil claim on behalf of Petrowest and the Petrowest Affiliates by relying on the Main Agreements. Doing so is arguably sufficient to bind the Receiver, a non‑signatory, as a party by operation of law to the Arbitration Agreements. I see no reason to discuss the distinction between trustees and receivers further.

[165]                     Third, contrary to the Receiver’s submission, it did not need to “adopt” or “perform” the contracts to become a party. A receiver’s obligation to either adopt or disclaim arises only in respect of executory contracts. Here, the parties agree that there are no remaining obligations for the Receiver to perform. Further inquiry into adoption or performance is not only unnecessary but would also clearly conflict with the arguable case threshold and the competence‑competence principle, which together prevent a court on an application under s. 15 of the Arbitration Act from conducting anything more than a superficial review of the record.

[166]                     Fourth, contrary to the Court of Appeal’s conclusion, disclaimer and separability do not affect the Receiver’s status as a party to the Arbitration Agreements. As noted, the Receiver concedes that it never disclaimed the Main Agreements or the Arbitration Agreements.

[167]                     Even setting this concession aside, I am of the view that the Court of Appeal misapplied the doctrine of separability. Separability does not apply absent a challenge to the validity of the main contract or of the arbitration agreement itself (Uber, at para. 224, per Côté J., dissenting, but not on this point). No issue is taken in this case with the validity of the Main Agreements or the Arbitration Agreements. Indeed, before the Court of Appeal, the Receiver argued that separability was “irrelevant” in this case (C.A. reasons, at para. 48). It now concedes that this Court does not need to consider separability to resolve this appeal. I accept this concession.

[168]                     I would add that the Court of Appeal’s approach to separability would undermine the central purpose of the Arbitration Act. In essence, the Court of Appeal held that receivers are permitted to revoke arbitration agreements unilaterally, without any judicial inquiry into their validity or enforceability. But separability is intended to safeguard arbitration agreements, not imperil them (see, e.g., T. Meshel, “Petrowest v. Peace River Hydro: The Revocability and Separability of Commercial Arbitration Agreements” (2022), 65 Can. Bus. L.J. 329). As I have explained, it is for a court — not a receiver — to determine whether an arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable according to the narrow statutory exceptions set out in s. 15(2).

[169]                     Finally, I emphasize the low arguable case threshold applicable at the first stage of the s. 15 analysis. I recognize that receivership is a flexible remedy which may require interfering with the contractual rights of third parties in certain circumstances. However, accepting the Receiver’s position at this stage of the s. 15 analysis would permit all court‑appointed receivers to avoid pre‑existing arbitration agreements with impunity. I do not believe this would be appropriate in view of the clear legislative and judicial preference in favour of party autonomy and arbitral jurisdiction.

(b)         Peace River Did Not Take a “Step in the Proceedings”

[170]                     The Receiver has not identified a reviewable error in the chambers judge’s finding that Peace River did not take a step in the proceedings. That finding was not challenged before the Court of Appeal. As such, it is not properly before this Court. Even if it were, I see no basis to question the chambers judge’s reasoning. She correctly held that undertaking to file a defence without invoking the rules of court is not a step in the proceedings. Nor is requesting an extension of time, as I explained above. Peace River did not take a step in the proceedings within the meaning of s. 15(1) of the Arbitration Act.

[171]                     Accordingly, s. 15 of the Arbitration Act is engaged. I must therefore grant a stay in favour of arbitration unless I find the Arbitration Agreements to be “void, inoperative or incapable of being performed” under s. 15(2).

(2)         Statutory Exceptions: The Arbitration Agreements Are “Inoperative” Under Section 15(2)

[172]                     At the second stage of the s. 15 framework, the burden shifts to the party seeking to avoid arbitration to establish on a balance of probabilities that the arbitration agreement at issue is void, inoperative, or incapable of being performed within the meaning of s. 15(2), as explained above.

[173]                     I conclude that the Receiver has established that the Arbitration Agreements are inoperative. Stated differently, the arbitral processes contemplated in the Arbitration Agreements would compromise the orderly and efficient resolution of the receivership, contrary to the objectives of the BIA. Further, while recognizing the importance of party autonomy and freedom of contract, referral to arbitration in the unique circumstances of this case would jeopardize the Receiver’s ability to maximize recovery for the creditors and to allow Petrowest and the Petrowest Affiliates to move forward with certainty. This conclusion is based on the following factors.

(a)           Effect of Arbitration on the Integrity of the Insolvency Proceedings

[174]                     The inexpediency of the multiple overlapping arbitral proceedings contemplated in the Arbitration Agreements, as compared to a single judicial process, is the determinative factor in this case. In these circumstances, I conclude that enforcing the Arbitration Agreements would compromise the orderly and efficient resolution of the receivership proceedings.

[175]                     The Receiver’s affidavit evidence outlines the chaotic arbitral processes that would result if this Court were to grant a stay under s. 15 of the Arbitration Act. First, the Receiver would need to participate in and fund at least four different arbitrations involving “seven different sets of counterparties” (A.R., vol. XI, at p. 2895). The funding for these proceedings would necessarily come from the estates of Petrowest and the Petrowest Affiliates, to the detriment of their creditors. Second, at least some of the respondents’ claims involve entities not subject to any of the Arbitration Agreements. As the chambers judge properly recognized, these claims may have to be determined by a court, in parallel with the arbitral proceedings described above. Finally, in the scenario just described, I agree with the Receiver that “[f]acts and argument would be repeated in different forums, before different decision makers, creating piecemeal decisions and a serious risk of conflicting outcomes” (R.F., at para. 6).

[176]                     The inefficient and protracted nature of the contemplated arbitral processes would plainly compromise the integrity of the receivership proceedings. I acknowledge the chambers judge’s finding that arbitration would not “derail” the insolvency proceedings (para. 51). However, this must be read alongside her finding that “the significant cost and delay inherent in the multiple [arbitral] proceedings that would occur in this case as compared to judicial determination is unfair to the creditors and contrary to the objects of the BIA” (para. 60). I agree.

[177]                     In light of the foregoing, I see no basis on which to interfere with the following factual findings made by the chambers judge:

•                        the parties agreed that declining the requested stay “would promote the efficient and inexpensive resolution of their dispute”, and no one suggested that the issues were “not appropriate for judicial determination” (para. 56);

•                        there was “no evidence” of any “realistic likelihood” that the parties would agree to streamline the arbitral proceedings through consolidation, notwithstanding their ability to do so (para. 57); and

•                        a single judicial process would “be faster and less expensive than four arbitrations and a possible court case” (para. 56).

[178]                     Accordingly, expediency and efficiency concerns militate strongly in favour of a finding that the enforcement of the Arbitration Agreements would compromise the objects of the BIA and that the Agreements are therefore inoperative under s. 15(2) of the Arbitration Act.

(b)         Relative Prejudice to the Parties From the Referral of the Dispute to Arbitration

[179]                     I agree with the chambers judge that Peace River has failed to show any prejudice it would suffer if the Arbitration Agreements were not enforced (para. 58). To the contrary, as already indicated, it conceded that a single judicial proceeding would be the most efficient and cost‑effective route. This supports my view that enforcing the Arbitration Agreements would compromise the receivership proceedings.

(c)           Urgency of Resolving the Dispute

[180]                     As noted, the parties agree that proceeding through the courts is the more expeditious option. I see no basis for interfering with the chambers judge’s finding that “[i]t will not be possible to distribute the proceeds” of the property of Petrowest and the Petrowest Affiliates to their creditors “until these disputes are resolved” (para. 60). This urgency further militates in favour of finding the Arbitration Agreements inoperative.

(d)         Applicability of a Stay of Proceedings Under Bankruptcy or Insolvency Law

[181]                     In light of the foregoing, it is unnecessary to consider the effect of the stay of proceedings under the Receivership Order on the enforceability of the Arbitration Agreements.

[182]                     Finally, I have had the benefit of reading my colleague’s reasons. His view that the analysis should start with the terms of the Receivership Order is a sensible one. Further, it cannot be said that his interpretation of the terms of the Receivership Order is without merit. However, in the particular circumstances of this case, I would decline to resolve the appeal on this basis. I say this for two reasons.

[183]                     First, the argument that the combined effect of paras. 3(c), 3(f) and 3(j) authorizes the Receiver to proceed in court despite the Arbitration Agreements was not squarely before the Court. While the parties made some submissions on the interpretation of the terms of the Receivership Order, for instance about the scope of the Receiver’s power to cease to perform the debtors’ contracts under para. 3(c), none suggested that it was the combined effect of paras. 3(c), 3(f) and 3(j) that enabled the Receiver to act so as to render the Arbitration Agreements inoperative. As a result, the Court did not have the benefit of assistance from the parties, nor the interveners, on this specific interpretive question. We also lack the benefit of analysis on this point from the courts below. This is significant because, in my respectful view, more than one interpretation of the Order remains plausible. It is not clear, for example, that the terms either expressly or impliedly authorize the Receiver to take the benefits of the agreements while avoiding their procedural burdens, such as the obligations arising from their arbitration clauses. Nor is it clear that the Receiver’s powers to initiate “proceedings” and exercise “remedies” render the Arbitration Agreements inoperative in this case. It is plausible to interpret the language of the Receivership Order as consistent with “proceeding”, and seeking “remedies”, through arbitration rather than in court.

[184]                     Second, resolving the question of the proper interpretation of the terms of the Receivership Order would have no impact on the disposition of the appeal. My colleague and I agree that the separability doctrine, as relied upon by the Court of Appeal, has no application here. We also share the view that the Arbitration Agreements are inoperative. Ultimately, whether they are inoperative because the Receivership Order authorizes the Receiver to act in a certain way or because a stay in favour of arbitration would compromise the orderly and efficient resolution of the receivership, the result is the same.

[185]                     Given that the interpretation of the terms of the Receivership Order was not fully argued by the parties and that the appeal can be resolved without addressing this issue, it is prudent to leave it to another day.

(3)         Conclusion on Section 15

[186]                     I agree with the courts below that Peace River’s application for a stay of proceedings under s. 15 of the Arbitration Act must be dismissed.

[187]                     The prerequisites for a mandatory stay in s. 15(1) are met. However, enforcing the Arbitration Agreements would compromise the orderly and efficient resolution of the receivership, contrary to the purposes of the BIA.

[188]                     Accordingly, the Arbitration Agreements are inoperative within the meaning of s. 15(2).

VII.      Disposition

[189]                     For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs throughout. In the result, the civil claim of Petrowest and the Petrowest Affiliates may proceed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia.

 

The reasons of Karakatsanis, Brown, Martin and Jamal JJ. were delivered by

 

                    Jamal J. —

[190]                     I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of my colleague Justice Côté. I agree with my colleague that Peace River’s application for a stay of proceedings under s. 15 of the Arbitration Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 55, should be dismissed, and thus the appeal should be dismissed, because the Arbitration Agreements are inoperative under s. 15(2) of the Arbitration Act.

[191]                     My point of departure from my colleague concerns the primary basis for finding the Arbitration Agreements to be inoperative. In my view, by suing in court to collect the accounts receivable allegedly owing, as authorized under the Receivership Order, the Receiver disclaimed the Arbitration Agreements. The Arbitration Agreements were thereby rendered inoperative. The analysis should start with the terms of the Receivership Order itself.

[192]                     Several provisions of the Receivership Order authorized the Receiver to sue in court to collect the accounts receivable allegedly owing and to disclaim the Arbitration Agreements, thus effectively rendering them inoperative:

•                        The Receivership Order authorized the Receiver to sue to collect the accounts receivable that Peace River allegedly owed Petrowest. Paragraph 3(f) of the Order authorized the Receiver “to receive and collect all monies and accounts now owed or hereafter owing to the Debtors [i.e., Petrowest] and to exercise all remedies of the Debtors in collecting such monies”. Paragraph 3(j) of the Order similarly authorized the Receiver “to initiate, prosecute and continue the prosecution of any and all proceedings” with respect to the “Property”, broadly defined in para. 2 of the Order as including “all of the Debtors’ current and future assets, undertakings and properties of every nature and kind whatsoever, and wherever situate[d], including all proceeds thereof”.

•                        The Receivership Order authorized the Receiver to disclaim the Arbitration Agreements. Paragraph 3(c) of the Order authorized the Receiver to “cease to perform any contracts of the Debtors”. An arbitration agreement is a contractual right of a party to have a claim referred to arbitration to the exclusion of the courts (see Dell Computer Corp. v. Union des consommateurs, 2007 SCC 34, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 801, at para. 160; Seidel v. TELUS Communications Inc., 2011 SCC 15, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 531, at paras. 137-38), and thus came within the scope of para. 3(c) of the Order, even if all the other contractual obligations had been performed.

[193]                     In my view, the combined effect of paras. 3(c), 3(f), and 3(j) of the Receivership Order is to authorize the Receiver to disclaim the Arbitration Agreements and to sue in court for amounts owing to the Debtors. These provisions authorize the Receiver to sue, either in court or before an arbitrator, at the Receiver’s election, based on what will best promote the orderly and efficient resolution of the receivership under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3.

[194]                     This interpretation of the Receivership Order does not rely on the arbitration doctrine of separability. The separability doctrine is recognized, for example, in s. 17(2) of the Ontario Arbitration Act, 1991, S.O. 1991, c. 17, and provides that, for the purposes of ruling on arbitral jurisdiction, an arbitration agreement “shall . . . be treated as an independent agreement that may survive even if the main agreement is found to be invalid” (see also Uber Technologies Inc. v. Heller, 2020 SCC 16, at para. 96, per Abella and Rowe JJ.). As Professor Tamar Meshel notes in her helpful article on the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal under appeal, the separability doctrine provides that “an arbitration clause does not necessarily become invalid merely because the underlying agreement is found to be invalid, and vice versa” (“Petrowest v. Peace River Hydro: The Revocability and Separability of Commercial Arbitration Agreements” (2022), 65 Can. Bus. L.J. 329, at p. 345 (footnote omitted)). Without the separability doctrine, “a contracting party could avoid arbitration simply by alleging that the underlying agreement was void or invalid” (Meshel, at p. 345 (footnote omitted)). I agree with Professor Meshel’s view that, because “neither party challenged the validity of the agreements in which the arbitration clauses were found, but rather only the arbitration clauses themselves”, the result is that “the separability doctrine, which simply operates to separate the validity analysis of an arbitration clause from that of the underlying agreement, [is] not relevant to [this] case” (Meshel, at p. 346 (footnote omitted)). I am not relying on the separability doctrine. I am simply interpreting the Receivership Order at issue in this case.

[195]                     I also disagree with my colleague’s view that reliance on the terms of the Receivership Order is precluded by Petrowest and the Receiver’s position before the Court of Appeal and this Court that the Receiver “has not expressly disclaimed” the Arbitration Agreements (para. 122, citing R.F., at para. 102, and A.F., Appendix B, at paras. 3 and 13). In my view, the legal effect of the Receiver suing in court and not before an arbitrator to collect the accounts receivable was undoubtedly to disclaim reliance on the Arbitration Agreements — conduct which, I repeat, was authorized by the Receivership Order itself. Indeed, although before this Court counsel for the Receiver erroneously relied on the doctrine of separability, her position was that “by its conduct the Receiver has disclaimed [the] Arbitration Agreements” (transcript, at p. 110).

[196]                     I also disagree with my colleague’s claim that this Court should not interpret the Receivership Order because this issue “was not squarely before the Court” and was “not fully argued by the parties” (Côté J.’s reasons, at paras. 183 and 185). The interpretation of the Receivership Order was amply debated before the Court, both in written submissions and during the oral hearing. The Receiver argued in its factum, for example, that “[a] court-appointed receiver authorized by court order to disclaim any contracts of the debtor may cease to perform arbitration agreements” (R.F., at para. 101, citing para. 3(c) of the Receivership Order). The Receiver submitted that “the Receiver was appointed with the court-ordered power to cease to perform any of the Petrowest Respondents’ contracts” (R.F., at para. 104, citing para. 3(c) of the Receivership Order). The proper interpretation of the Receivership Order also occupied a significant part of the oral hearing (see transcript, at pp. 9-12, 15-17, 41-42, 81-87, 97 and 105). This Court can and should interpret such a template court order. As I have already noted, courts must start with the terms of the relevant receivership order. Declining to address this issue leaves the insolvency and arbitration bars in a regrettable state of uncertainty.

[197]                     To be clear, I am not suggesting that a receiver can unilaterally “revoke” an otherwise valid arbitration agreement. I agree with my colleague that “[o]nly a court can make a finding that an arbitration agreement is inoperative or incapable of being performed” (para. 6). However, the courts’ exclusive power to declare an arbitration agreement inoperative is distinct from the question of whether a receivership order authorizes a receiver to act in a certain way in a court-appointed receivership. When a receiver’s action is challenged, as it has been here, it is a court that will ultimately determine whether the receiver has acted under the authority of the receivership order, and thus whether the arbitration agreement is inoperative or incapable of being performed.

[198]                     To the extent that the Receivership Order did not authorize the Receiver to sue in court, I otherwise agree with my colleague’s reasons for concluding that ss. 183 and 243 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act provided a statutory basis for the chambers judge to declare the Arbitration Agreements inoperative and to dismiss the stay application. As my colleague explains, in this case, requiring arbitration of the collection action would compromise the orderly and efficient resolution of the receivership.

[199]                     I would dismiss the appeal with costs throughout.

                  English version of the judgment delivered by

 

                  The Court —

[1]                              We are all of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.

[2]                              In a unanimous judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal relating to the Taxation Act, CQLR, c. I‑3 (“T.A.”), Cournoyer J.A. correctly stated the following:

     [translation] Because we are engaged primarily in an exercise of statutory interpretation, and for ease of reference, I will reproduce sections 50, 54 and 422 T.A. again:

     50. An employee who transfers or disposes of rights under the agreement referred to in section 48 in respect of securities to a person with whom the employee is dealing at arm’s length, is deemed to receive because of the employee’s office or employment, in the taxation year in which the employee makes the transfer or disposition, a benefit equal to the amount by which the value of the consideration for the transfer or disposition exceeds the amount paid by the employee to acquire those rights.

     [...]

     54. If a particular qualifying person has agreed to sell or issue one of its securities, or a security of a qualifying person with which it does not deal at arm’s length, to one of its employees or to an employee of the qualifying person with which it does not deal at arm’s length, the employee is deemed to receive no benefit under or because of the agreement other than as provided in this division.

     [...]

     422. Except as otherwise provided in this Part, the disposition or acquisition of a property by a taxpayer is deemed to be made at the fair market value of the property at the time of the disposition or acquisition, as the case may be, where

     (a) the taxpayer acquires it by gift, succession or will, or because of a disposition that does not result in a change in the beneficial ownership of the property;

     (b) the taxpayer acquires it from a person with whom he is not dealing at arm’s length, for an amount greater than such value; or

     (c) the taxpayer disposes of it

     i. to a person with whom the taxpayer is not dealing at arm’s length, gratuitously or for consideration that is less than that fair market value,

     ii. to any person by gift or

     iii. to a trust because of a disposition that does not result in a change in the beneficial ownership of the property.

     . . .

     Mr. Des Groseillers argues that section 422 does not apply in this case because sections 47.18 to 58.0.7 of the T.A. constitute a complete code that contains, within itself and in an exhaustive manner, all the rules for the computation of income derived from the issuance of securities to employees, as well as all the legal fictions that the legislature considered necessary to adopt in support of those rules. He adds that section 54 T.A. is a section that excludes the application of section 422 T.A., by providing otherwise.

     How should the matter be resolved?

     . . .

     First, section 50 T.A. provides for two things. To begin with, it indicates the time at which a benefit received because of an agreement referred to in section 48 T.A. will be taxed. In addition, by treating the transfer as employment income, section 50 creates an exception to the general rule that the disposition of property gives rise to a capital gain or loss. Subparagraph 422(c)(ii) T.A., in attributing a value to the consideration, has no impact on these legal fictions. That being said, there is, in my view, no actual conflict between section 50 and section 422.

     Second, the very broad formulation of the rule set out in section 422 suggests that the legislature’s purpose was to attribute to any disposition of property by a person a value equal to the fair market value of the property for the purposes of computation of income. Moreover, the legislature did not explicitly exclude the Division of the statute relating to employee stock options from the application of section 422 when it enacted the Taxation Act in 1972 or when subsequent amendments were made thereto. Its silence in this regard is telling, because there are several express references in the T.A. to the non‑applicability of section 422.

     The only effect of section 54 T.A. is to give precedence to the application of sections 49 et seq. over any other section that lays down a taxing rule. Section 54 does not prevent the ARQ from relying on the presumptions set out in the T.A. in computing a taxpayer’s taxable income.

     . . .

     In this case, the interpretation adopted by the trial judge posits that Division VI of the T.A. is a complete code and that “section 422 T.A. may not be relied upon to supplement the rules for the computation of income provided for in Division VI”.

     However, while section 54 ensures that sections 49 et seq. of the T.A. apply to benefits arising from the granting of stock options and excludes those benefits from the ambit of sections 36 and 37, it does not, in the absence of clear legislative indicia to this effect, constitute a code so complete and so hermetic that the application of section 422 is excluded.

     I note that section 422 is in Title VII of the T.A., which concerns the omnibus rules relating to the computation of income. It provides more specifically that where a taxpayer disposes of property to any person by gift, as in this case, the disposition is deemed to be made at the fair market value of the property at the time of the disposition. [Emphasis in original; footnotes omitted.]

[3]                              We agree with Cournoyer J.A.’s view; this is sufficient to dismiss the appeal. The other grounds advanced by the appellants are without merit.

[4]                              Like the Court of Appeal, we conclude that the respondent properly assessed Mr. Des Groseillers, pursuant to s. 50 T.A., for the benefit received. In this case, and on the basis of s. 422(c)ii T.A., the value of the consideration received is deemed to be equal to the fair market value of the stock options at the time of the gift.

[5]                              The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs throughout.

                  Rowe J. —

I.               Introduction

[1]                              This appeal concerns proper calculation of the quantum payable by the appellant (“Nova”) to the respondents (“Dow”) as a remedy for patent infringement. Central to this appeal is the patent law remedy labelled an “accounting of profits”. An accounting of profits requires that a party who infringes a patent (the “infringer”) disgorge all the profits they gained that are causally attributable to the invention.

[2]                              Nova asks this Court to deduct theoretical profits that it could have earned on an entirely unrelated product had it not infringed, from the profits that the company earned by selling products that infringed Dow’s patent. The difference between these values, Nova submits, should be the quantum payable to Dow.

[3]                              I disagree. While in certain circumstances the hypothetical profits that an infringer could have earned by selling a non-infringing option are relevant to a calculation of an accounting of profits, this is not such a case. A “non-infringing option” is any product that helps courts isolate the profits causally attributable to the invention from the profits which arose at the same time the infringing product was used or sold, but which are not causally attributable to the invention. Whether there is a relevant non-infringing option that can assist the court in this calculation is a question of fact. The infringer has the onus of establishing that there is a relevant non-infringing option. On the basis of the record before the reference judge, there were no relevant non-infringing options to consider. He therefore fairly determined that all of Nova’s profits were causally attributable to Dow’s invention. I see no reason to disturb this factual finding.

[4]                              Additionally, for the first time in Canadian law, the reference judge awarded “springboard profits” to Dow. Springboard profits are profits that arise post-patent-expiry but that are causally attributable to infringement of the invention during the period of patent protection. Nova appeals this award, which was upheld at the Federal Court of Appeal. On this point, too, Nova’s appeal must fail. Springboard profits are an extension of the fundamental principle that, in calculating an accounting of profits, the infringer must disgorge all profits causally attributable to infringement of the invention. It is irrelevant when the profits arise, provided they are causally connected to infringement. Like non-infringing options, whether profits that arise post-patent-expiry are causally attributable to infringement of the invention, during the period of patent protection, is a question of fact. On the basis of the record before him, the reference judge determined that some of Nova’s post-patent-expiry profits were causally attributable to infringement of the invention: by infringing Dow’s patent, Nova had entered the market created by the invention early, built market share, and used that market advantage to earn profits post-patent-expiry that were causally attributable to infringement of the invention during the period of patent protection. I see no reason to disturb his factual findings on this point.

[5]                              It follows that I would dismiss Nova’s appeal.

II.            Introduction to Patent Law Remedies

[6]                              To understand this decision, an introduction to three concepts is needed: (1) remedies in patent law; (2) the calculation methods for the remedy at issue in this appeal (an “accounting of profits”); and (3) this Court’s leading authority on calculating an accounting of profits (Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser, 2004 SCC 34, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 902). I explain each below. After introducing these topics, I will (4) clarify the methods of calculating an accounting of profits.

A.           Remedies in Patent Law

[7]                              Below I define three patent law remedies and explain how they relate to each other. The three statutory remedies I define are (1) reasonable compensation, (2) damages, and (3) an accounting of profits.

Term

Definition

Reasonable Compensation

Reasonable compensation can be granted for any loss caused by the infringer’s use of the invention between the patent’s publication and the grant of the patent.

 

This remedy is authorized by s. 55(2) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4.

 

This remedy typically entitles a patentee to a “reasonable royalty” (S. J. Perry and T. A. Currier, Canadian Patent Law (4th ed. 2021), at §§17.93-17.94).

 

A reasonable royalty is “that which the infringer would have had to pay if, instead of infringing the Patent, [the infringer] had come to be licensed under the Patent” (AlliedSignal Inc. v. Du Pont Canada Inc. (1998), 1998 CanLII 7464 (FC), 78 C.P.R. (3d) 129 (F.C. (T.D.)), at para. 199, quoting Unilever PLC v. Procter & Gamble Inc. (1993), 47 C.P.R. (3d) 479 (F.C. (T.D.)), at p. 571 (text in brackets in original)). “The test is what rate would result from negotiations between a willing licensor and a willing licensee” (para. 199).

 

Damages

Damages compensate the patentee for all pecuniary losses causally attributable to infringement after the grant of the patent.

 

This remedy is authorized by s. 55(1) of the Patent Act.

 

Damages can include lost profits on sales or due to depression of prices, and lost income from licensing opportunities, among others (Perry and Currier, at §17.9).

 

Accounting of Profits

An accounting of profits requires that the infringer disgorge all profits causally attributable to infringement of the invention after the grant of the patent.

 

This remedy is authorized by s. 57(1)(b) of the Patent Act.

 

This remedy is an alternative to an award of damages (Apotex Inc. v. ADIR, 2020 FCA 60, 172 C.P.R. (4th) 1, at para. 35). It is an equitable, discretionary remedy (AlliedSignal Inc. v. Du Pont Canada Inc. (1995), 61 C.P.R. (3d) 417 (F.C.A.), at pp. 444-46). Judges may consider practical consequences, including expediency, misbehaviour by litigants, and whether the patentee practices the invention itself when exercising this discretion (K. Andrews and J. de Beer, “Accounting of Profits to Remedy Biotechnology Patent Infringement” (2009), 47 Osgoode Hall L.J. 619, at p. 641; Bayer Inc. v. Cobalt Pharmaceuticals Co., 2016 FC 1192, 142 C.P.R. (4th) 374, at paras. 6 and 10; Seedlings Life Science Ventures, LLC v.  Pfizer Canada ULC, 2021 FCA 154, at paras. 76 and 79-81 (CanLII)).

 

 

B.            Calculating an Accounting of Profits

[8]                              As previously stated, this appeal addresses the correct method of calculating an accounting of profits. Courts have calculated an accounting of profits in three ways: (1) differential costs, (2) full costs, and (3) differential profits. I explain each below.

Term

Definition

Differential Costs

The differential costs approach requires the infringer to disgorge the difference between actual revenues earned by selling the infringing product and the actual costs associated with producing the infringing product.

 

Infringers can deduct any expense incurred because of the infringing activity. Any category of expense, so long as it is directly attributable to the infringing activity, is deductible. These can be thought of as “direct” expenses: “. . . all expenses — variable, current, increased, fixed, or capital — that are directly attributable to the infringement, are deductible” (Andrews and de Beer, at p. 646).

 

Infringers cannot deduct expenses they would have incurred in the absence of infringement (Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Rivett, 2009 FC 317, [2010] 2 F.C.R. 93, at para. 30; Andrews and de Beer, at pp. 643-44).

 

Full Costs

The full costs approach also requires the infringer to disgorge the difference between actual revenues earned by selling the infringing product and the actual costs associated with producing the infringing product.

 

But, unlike the differential costs approach, the full costs approach allows infringers to deduct all direct costs and a portion of the indirect expenses incurred to make the infringing product.

 

Indirect expenses are costs which did not arise solely because the infringer manufactured the infringing goods (i.e., expenses that would have been incurred in the absence of infringement) (Rivett, at para. 32; Andrews and de Beer, at pp. 643 and 646).

 

Simply put, infringers can deduct more costs from their revenue (and thus reduce the profits payable to the patentee) under the full costs approach as opposed to the differential costs approach.

 

Differential Profits

The differential profits approach requires an infringer to disgorge the difference between the actual profits (revenue minus costs) earned by selling the infringing product and the profits it could have earned had it sold the best “non-infringing option” (Schmeiser, at para. 102).

 

As I will explain, the main issue in this appeal is the appropriate scope of a non-infringing option. I will expand on this concept in the next section.

 

The onus is on the infringer to prove that there is a non-infringing option (see Beloit Canada Ltée v. Valmet Oy (1994), 55 C.P.R. (3d) 433 (F.C. (T.D.)), at p. 456). 

 

C.            Schmeiser

[9]                              Schmeiser is this Court’s leading authority on calculating an accounting of profits. The decision addressed an alleged patent infringement and the appropriate remedy flowing from that infringement. Most relevant to this decision was the Court’s acceptance of the differential profits approach and its use of a non-infringing option.

[10]                          By way of background, Monsanto brought a patent infringement claim against Mr. Schmeiser. Monsanto held a patent on a genetic modification to canola seeds, marketed as Roundup Ready Canola. The genetic modification to the canola “dramatically” increased the plant’s tolerance to herbicides containing glyphosate (para. 8). Farmers could spray the crop with a glyphosate herbicide after the plants had emerged from the soil without killing the crop.

[11]                          This Court determined that Monsanto’s patent was valid and that Mr. Schmeiser infringed that patent by planting Roundup Ready Canola without a licence. Monsanto requested and was granted an accounting of profits as a remedy. The company argued Mr. Schmeiser was required to disgorge profits he earned from selling the harvested canola seeds.

[12]                          This Court disagreed. It stressed it was “settled law” that, under an accounting of profits, a patentee “is only entitled to that portion of the infringer’s profit which is causally attributable to the invention” (para. 101). The preferred means of determining this was the “value-based or ‘differential profit’ approach” (para. 102). To determine which portion of Mr. Schmeiser’s profits were causally attributable to Monsanto’s invention, this Court compared the profits Mr. Schmeiser earned from the sale of Roundup Ready canola with the profits he could have earned had he used the best non-infringing option: regular, non-genetically modified canola seeds. The difference between these two values was zero: Mr. Schmeiser did not spray the crop with a glyphosate herbicide and, therefore, did not benefit from the increased yields that Monsanto’s patent offered. The entirety of Mr. Schmeiser’s profits were attributable to non-patented features of the product — the canola seed itself. None of the profits he earned were causally attributable to the invention.

[13]                          From Schmeiser, it can be understood that a non-infringing option is any product that helps courts isolate the profits causally attributable to the invention from the profits which arose at the same time the infringing product was used or sold, but which are not causally attributable to the invention. As stated by the Court, a patentee is only entitled to profits “causally attributable to the invention” (para. 101).

D.           Simplified Method of Calculating an Accounting of Profits

[14]                          An accounting of profits is sometimes presented as a choice between the (1) differential costs, (2) full costs, and (3) differential profits approaches (see Rivett, at para. 28). But these approaches are not completely distinct. The starting point of analysis for all three methods is determining the infringing product’s actual revenues and costs. Even in the differential profits approach, courts must first calculate the infringer’s actual profits earned by selling the infringing product (i.e., deduct the actual cost of producing the infringing product from actual revenue). This calculation must precede the comparison between actual profits earned on the infringing product and the profits an infringer could have earned had they sold the best non-infringing option.

[15]                          It is therefore more appropriate to conceptualize an accounting of profits as a three-step test:

Step 1: Calculate the actual profits earned by selling the infringing product — i.e., revenue minus (full or differential) costs.

Step 2: Determine whether there is a non-infringing option that can help isolate the profits causally attributable to the invention from the portion of the infringer’s profits not causally attributable to the invention — i.e., differential profits. It is at this step that judges should apply the principles of causation. Causation “need not be determined by scientific precision: it is ‘essentially a practical question of fact which can best be answered by ordinary common sense’” (Merck & Co., Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2015 FCA 171, [2016] 2 F.C.R. 202, at para. 44, quoting Snell v. Farrell, 1990 CanLII 70 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 311, at para. 328).

Step 3: If there is a non-infringing option, subtract the profits the infringer could have made had it used the non-infringing option from its actual profits, to determine the amount to be disgorged.

[16]                          Step 2 is the principal issue in this appeal. As I will set out, we are called on to clarify what is a non-infringing option. We are not called on to resolve whether differential costs or full costs is the preferred method for calculating an infringer’s costs in Step 1. While this was dealt with in the decision under appeal, we did not receive submissions on this issue (see 2020 FCA 141, [2021] 1 F.C.R. 551, at paras. 143-64). Accordingly, I do not deal further with this issue.

III.         Facts

[17]                          Nova and Dow are competitors in the plastics industry. In 1994, Dow filed a patent for new plastics (“patented plastics”). The patented plastics were metallocene linear low-density polyethylenes that had superior strength and processability characteristics as compared to conventional linear low-density polyethylenes. In plain language, the patented plastics are thin but strong plastics, used in items like garbage bags and food wrappings. The patented plastics serviced a market demand for items with these characteristics. Dow’s patent was issued in 2006 and expired in 2014.

[18]                          Nova made and sold plastics covered by Dow’s patent. Dow brought an infringement claim against Nova. In the infringement proceedings, Nova challenged the validity of Dow’s patent on a variety of grounds. The Federal Court rejected these arguments, holding that the patent was valid and that Nova had infringed the patent (2014 FC 844, 129 C.P.R. (4th) 199, aff’d 2016 FCA 216, 142 C.P.R. (4th) 339). As a remedy, Dow was permitted to seek an accounting of profits, to be assessed by a subsequent reference.

[19]                          The infringement decision is not at issue. This appeal relates only to the remedy.

IV.         Decisions Below

A.           Federal Court, 2017 FC 350, [2018] 2 F.C.R. 154

[20]                          The main issue before the reference judge was the proper approach to assessing the quantum of profit that Nova had to disgorge as a result of infringement. Nova argued it should be permitted to subtract the market cost of ethylene from the revenues it earned selling the patented plastics.

[21]                          Ethylene is the main ingredient in the patented plastics. Nova produces its own ethylene at a cost that is lower than market price. Consequently, Nova’s cost to manufacture the patented plastics was significantly less than if the company had purchased the ethylene at market price.

[22]                          The reference judge rejected Nova’s argument. He held that only the actual costs incurred to produce the patented plastics were appropriately deductible in Step 1. The market price of ethylene was not a “cost” that Nova incurred (paras. 137-40).

[23]                          Notably, Nova did not argue that selling ethylene at market prices was a non-infringing option for the purposes of the differential profits approach. Nova conceded that there were no direct non-infringing options to the patented plastics (para. 146).

[24]                          Instead, in the alternative, Nova argued that the reference judge should deduct the “full cost” it incurred to manufacture the patented plastics (para. 134). The reference judge accepted this argument. The reference judge awarded Dow a sum equal to Nova’s actual revenue from selling the patented plastics minus its actual full costs (as described in para. 8 above) associated with producing the patented plastics.

[25]                          Also relevant to this appeal is the reference judge’s decision to award springboard profits. Dow argued that some of the profits Nova earned by selling the patented plastics after patent expiry were causally attributable to Nova’s patent infringement. Had Nova not infringed the patent, it would have taken time to reach the same level of sales that it enjoyed after the patent’s expiry. As a result, Dow argued, these profits were causally attributable to Nova’s infringement and, accordingly, had to be disgorged.

[26]                          Nova advanced two arguments in response. First, it argued that springboard profits could not be awarded under Canadian law. Second, it argued, in the alternative, that, if springboard profits were permissible, then an award of reasonable compensation under s. 55(2) (as described in para. 7 above) was sufficient to account for the company’s post-patent-expiry sales.

[27]                          The reference judge concluded that Dow was entitled to springboard profits. Some of Nova’s post-patent-expiry profits were causally attributable to Nova’s infringement of the invention during the period of patent protection and they were not covered by the compensation award under s. 55(2) (paras. 123 and 130). Those profits had to be disgorged. Regardless of when profits materialize, the law demands that infringers disgorge all profits causally attributable to infringement of the invention.

B.            Federal Court of Appeal, 2020 FCA 141, [2021] 1 F.C.R. 551

[28]                          On appeal, Nova again argued that the court should use the market price of ethylene, rather than the actual costs it incurred to manufacture ethylene, when calculating the profits payable to Dow. However, the company’s submissions as to why this was the correct calculation differed from those at trial. 

[29]                          At trial, Nova asked to deduct the market price of ethylene as a “cost”. On appeal, Nova advanced two new arguments. First, Nova argued that, had it not used the ethylene to make the patented plastics, it could have earned a profit by selling that ethylene to third parties. It was therefore entitled to deduct the profits it could have earned by selling ethylene to third parties from the profits payable to Dow (paras. 90˗92). Second, and in the alternative, Nova argued that a portion of the profits earned by selling the patented plastics were due to its own manufacturing efficiencies, rather than Dow’s patent. The court should thus apportion those profits out of the amount awarded to Dow (para. 98).

[30]                          Finally, Nova argued that springboard profits were inappropriate.

[31]                          A majority of the Federal Court of Appeal rejected Nova’s arguments and upheld the entirety of the award to Dow.

[32]                          The dissenting judge disagreed on the issue of whether Nova could reduce the profits payable to Dow because it manufactures ethylene at below-market cost. In her view, Nova did not need to disgorge the profits attributable to its below-market-cost manufacturing of ethylene because those profits were not caused by making and selling the patented plastics. The profits earned from ethylene therefore needed to be “apportioned” from the profits earned by selling the patented plastics.

V.           Issues

[33]                          This appeal raises two issues:

(1)                  Did the lower courts err in calculating the profits payable to Dow under an accounting of profits?

(2)                  Is Dow entitled to springboard profits?

VI.         Analysis

A.           Issue 1: Did the Lower Courts Err in Calculating the Profits Payable to Dow Under an Accounting of Profits?

[34]                          Before this Court, Nova again changed its argument as to why the quantum awarded to Dow was inappropriately high. While previously the company focused its arguments on “Step 1” of the accounting of profits calculation, before this Court it focused on “Step 2”.

[35]                          My analysis of this issue proceeds as follows. First, I explain why the reference judge did not err in refusing to deduct the market price of ethylene as if it were a cost that Nova had incurred. Second, I provide a brief summary of Nova’s new arguments before this Court. In the third and fourth sections, I set out the conceptual underpinnings of an accounting of profits and non-infringing options, respectively. An understanding of these topics is necessary to assess Nova’s new arguments. Fifth, I apply these principles to the facts of this case and explain why Nova’s arguments must fail.

(1)         The Market Price of Ethylene Was Not a Deductible Cost

[36]                          Nova effectively conceded before this Court that the reference judge did not err in refusing to deduct the market price of ethylene as a true cost associated with making the patented plastics. This was sensible. When calculating the infringer’s profits in Step 1, courts should consider only actual revenues and costs.

[37]                          This conclusion flows from the principle that a patentee must take the infringer as they find them. If an infringer is an inefficient manufacturer, and, as a result, makes less profit than theoretically possible, the patentee cannot claim profits that the infringer “should have” made (N. V. Siebrasse, A. J. Stack et al., “Accounting of Profits in Intellectual Property Cases in Canada (2007)” (2008), 24 C.I.P.R. 83, at p. 87). The opposite is also true. If an infringer is an efficient manufacturer, the patentee is entitled to all the profits actually made, even if the patentee could not have achieved similar profit levels. Accordingly, the reference judge did not err by refusing to deduct the market price of ethylene as a “cost” in Step 1 (F.C. reasons, at paras. 139-40).

(2)         Nova’s New Argument: Pail and Crate Plastics Were Valid Non-infringing Options

[38]                          Nova advances new arguments before this Court, which focus on Step 2. Nova argues that had it not manufactured the patented plastics, it would have used its manufacturing capacity to make and sell entirely different plastics: high˗density polyethylenes, which are inflexible plastics used to make items like pails, crates, and buckets (“pail and crate plastics”). The sales of pail and crate plastics would have generated profit that Nova argues is properly deductible from the profits earned by infringing.

[39]                          The pail and crate plastics markets and patented plastics markets do not overlap. A potential buyer interested in the patented plastics would not purchase pail and crate plastics as an alternative (F.C. reasons, at paras. 146-49; F.C.A. reasons, at para. 97). Nevertheless, Nova says the only way to determine which of its profits are causally attributable to Dow’s invention is by subtracting the profits it would have made had it sold pail and crate plastics from the profits it made from the patented plastics. Nova submits that this approach follows from Schmeiser.

[40]                          As discussed, Schmeiser held that the differential profits approach is the “preferred” means of determining what profits are causally attributable to the invention. Under differential profits, courts subtract the profits the infringer could have made using the “best non-infringing option” from the “profit[s] attributable to the invention” (Schmeiser, at para. 102). The patentee is entitled to the difference between these two sums.

[41]                          Nova submits that an infringer’s “best non-infringing option” is synonymous with the infringer’s “most profitable” alternative option. Under their reading of Schmeiser, courts would determine the profits payable to the patentee by subtracting (a) the profits the infringer could have made had they pursued any other alternative course of conduct from (b) the infringing product profits (i.e., profits payable = (b) minus (a)). My colleague endorses Nova’s approach, as do several interveners. The Canadian Generic Pharmaceutical Association, for example, suggested that if a drug manufacturer earned $1 million a year selling pain medication, but switched some pain medication production capacity to make a patented cancer drug that generated $2 million in yearly profits, the infringer would only need to disgorge $1 million per year under the differential profits approach. This flows from the fact that the company would have made $1 million on their pain medication had they never infringed. If an infringer proves on a balance of probabilities that they would have made other profits (had they never infringed), they can deduct that sum from the profit gained by infringing, even if the products are entirely unrelated.

[42]                          I disagree. To explain why, it is necessary to understand the purpose of (1) an accounting of profits and (2) non-infringing options.

(3)         Purpose of an Accounting of Profits

[43]                          The Patent Act is designed to encourage research and development (Apotex Inc. v. Sanofi-Synthelabo Canada Inc., 2008 SCC 61, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 265, at para. 64). It does this through the “patent bargain”: an inventor discloses their useful invention to the public in exchange for a time-limited market monopoly on that invention (Teva Canada Ltd. v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2012 SCC 60, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 625, at para. 32; Apotex Inc. v. Wellcome Foundation Ltd., 2002 SCC 77, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 153, at para. 37; Perry and Currier, at §3.1; R. T. Hughes and D. P. Clarizio, Hughes & Woodley on Patents (2nd ed. (loose-leaf)), at §1). This bargain mutually benefits the public and the inventor. The public benefits by receiving innovations in science and technology. The inventor benefits because they receive a time-limited market monopoly. The inventor can use the monopoly to generate profits and compensate themselves for the time, effort, and risk associated with making the invention.

[44]                          An accounting of profits is a remedial tool designed to protect the patent bargain. It does this by (1) disgorging the profits earned from patent infringement to the patentee and (2) ensuring that infringers are deterred but not punished for infringement (ADIR, at para. 37; Atlantic Lottery Corp. Inc. v. Babstock, 2020 SCC 19, at para. 24).

[45]                          Disgorgement is necessary because allowing infringers to appropriate the benefits of the patent monopoly for themselves “discourages research and development, and the disclosure of useful inventions” (Merck, at para. 42). If infringers could keep the profits earned from patent infringement, they could appropriate the time, effort, and risk associated with making the invention for their own benefit. This would make disclosure less likely, and the public would receive fewer innovative products.

[46]                          To fulfill the purpose underlying an accounting of profits, the infringer must disgorge to the patentee the “portion of the infringer’s profits which is causally attributable to the invention” (Schmeiser, at para. 101 (emphasis added)). Courts isolate “the value that the invention has brought to the product” (Rivett, at para. 61). They then ensure that the defendant will “disgorge any profits improperly received by the defendant as a result of its wrongful use of the plaintiff’s property. Such profits, having been earned through the use of the plaintiff’s property, rightly belong to the plaintiff” (Bayer Aktiengesellschaft v. Apotex Inc. (2001), 2001 CanLII 28237 (ON SC), 10 C.P.R. (4th) 151 (Ont. S.C.J.), at para. 12; see also Laboratoires Servier v. Apotex Inc., 2008 FC 825, 67 C.P.R. (4th) 241, at para. 504, aff’d 2009 FCA 222, 75 C.P.R. (4th) 443).

[47]                          Deterrence flows from disgorgement. The incentive to infringe is minimized if an infringer has to disgorge all profits causally attributable to the invention (Andrews and de Beer, at p. 640). To be clear, an accounting of profits is not the only remedial tool available to deter infringement and protect the patent bargain. Alternative remedies, including damages, elevated costs, injunctive relief, and punitive damages, may also be available to counterbalance any incentive to infringe. An accounting of profits, alongside these other remedial tools, protects the patent bargain. For example, it discourages efficient infringement: when an infringer’s profits exceed the damages suffered by the patentee.

[48]                          But deterrence should not be conflated with punishment. An infringer can be liable for patent infringement even if they had no knowledge of the patent or genuinely believed that the patent was invalid (Schmeiser, at para. 49). An accounting of profits should therefore discourage infringement but do no more. This requires disgorging only the profits causally attributable to the invention. Requiring infringers to disgorge anything more would constitute punishment and risk chilling public innovation and competition. Disgorging anything less would reduce the incentive to invent (Merck, at para. 42; ADIR, at para. 39).

[49]                          I would pause to note that Justice Côté and I agree on many points, including that an accounting of profits is an equitable remedy (although I would underscore that, in these circumstances, the remedy must serve the purposes of the Patent Act); that “[t]he remedy should not punish potential competitors for competing in areas they reasonably believe are not properly covered by a patent”, as I indicate in my preceding paragraph; and that differential profits should isolate profits attributable to “unauthorized use of the patentee’s invention” (paras. 148 and 157). Our major difference relates to the methodology by which to isolate such profits. While we agree that this requires having regard to a non-infringing option, if there is one, where we disagree is how to give practical effect to that term. That is our fundamental point of difference. I will seek to explain the way in which the jurisprudence, read in the context of the scheme and purposes of the Patent Act, calls for that term to be given effect.

(4)         Purpose of Non-infringing Option

[50]                          In my view, Schmeiser’s use of the term “non-infringing option” should be interpreted with the goals of an accounting of profits in mind: (1) to disgorge the “portion of the infringer’s profit which is causally attributable to the invention” and (2) to deter, but not to punish, infringers (Schmeiser, at para. 101).

[51]                          Understood in this light, a non-infringing option helps courts isolate the profits causally attributable to the invention from the profits which arose at the same time the infringing product was used or sold, but which are not causally attributable to the invention. For example, when a company sells a product with a component that infringes a patent, courts need to determine the profit generated by (1) the patented invention and (2) the rest of the non-patented product. To generate these sums, courts should compare the profits generated from the sale of the infringing product with the patented feature — i.e., the actual profits — with the profits the infringer would have made on the sale of a similar product without the patented feature — i.e., the non-infringing option (Perry and Currier, at §17.50). Non-infringing options are “generally used in cases where an infringement allows the infringer to commercialize a good in a more profitable manner than [they] could have without the infringement” (Cinar Corporation v. Robinson, 2013 SCC 73, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1168, at para. 80). The concept helps courts recognize the limited nature of a patent, as “a patent does not confer a complete monopoly if a defendant could make or sell a non-infringing version of the patented invention” (ADIR, at para. 40).

[52]                          Schmeiser, this Court’s leading authority on accounting of profits, affirms that this is the purpose of non-infringing options. As discussed, in Schmeiser, Monsanto’s patent related to a particular canola gene that permitted a farmer to spray the crop with a glyphosate˗based herbicide, which promised to increase harvesting yields. To determine which portion of Mr. Schmeiser’s profits were causally attributable to this invention, this Court compared the profits Mr. Schmeiser earned from the sale of the patented Roundup Ready canola with the profits he could have earned had he used the best non-infringing option: regular, non-genetically modified canola seeds. Since Mr. Schmeiser never sprayed his seeds with herbicide, none of his profits were causally attributable to the invention. All the profits earned were causally attributable to non-patented features of the sold product — the canola seed itself. The use of a non-infringing option therefore helped this Court determine that, despite infringing the patent, none of Mr. Schmeiser’s profits were causally attributable to the invention.

[53]                          Non-infringing options can also help courts determine when some, but not all, of the infringer’s profits are causally attributable to the invention. For example, in Rivett and the related judgment in Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Janssens, 2009 FC 318, 343 F.T.R. 234, the Federal Court required the defendants to disgorge a portion of their soybean profits because some of their profits were causally attributable to Monsanto’s invention. The defendants infringed Monsanto’s patent by planting genetically modified soybean seeds without licence. Like Schmeiser, the genetically modified crop allowed producers to spray a particular herbicide on soybean plants without killing them. However, the defendants, unlike Mr. Schmeiser, profited from the invention by spraying their crop with herbicide and increasing harvesting yields (Rivett, at para. 95; Janssens, at para. 27).

[54]                          As instructed by Schmeiser, the trial judge in both Rivett and Janssens used a non-infringing option — non-genetically modified soybean seeds — to determine how much of the defendants’ profits were causally attributable to Monsanto’s invention. The Federal Court of Appeal, which heard the appeals together, agreed and relied on evidence demonstrating that farmers who planted Monsanto’s genetically modified soybean and sprayed the crop with herbicide earned 18 percent higher profits than farmers using traditional soybean seeds (2010 FCA 207, [2012] 1 F.C.R. 473). The defendants therefore had to disgorge 18 percent of their profits.

[55]                          Schmeiser, Rivett, and Janssens reveal the utility of non-infringing options: the concept helps courts isolate profits causally attributable to the invention from profits causally attributable to non-inventive aspects of the infringing product. Since Mr. Schmeiser did not spray his canola with herbicide, none of his profits were causally attributable to Monsanto’s invention. All of Mr. Schmeiser’s profits were generated by the sale of canola seeds. Monsanto did not invent or hold a patent on canola seeds (Schmeiser, at paras. 16-17 and 21). Similarly, in Rivett and Janssens, a non-infringing option helped the court isolate the profits causally attributable to Monsanto’s invention from the profits attributable to non-inventive features of the infringing product, e.g. the profits attributable to the extra yield caused by the herbicide˗resistant gene versus the profits attributable to the soybean seed itself (Andrews and de Beer, at p. 625). Said differently, considering a non-infringing option ensured that the court did not erroneously extend Monsanto’s patent by entitling it to profits generated by product features it did not invent. Demanding that infringers disgorge profit that was not causally attributable to the invention would undermine the patent bargain by granting the patentee a windfall and punishing the infringer.

[56]                          Courts recognized the need to consider non-infringing options in this manner before Schmeiser. In Lubrizol Corp. v. Imperial Oil Ltd., 1996 CanLII 4095 (FCA), [1997] 2 F.C. 3 (C.A.), for example, Imperial Oil sold motor oil containing a patented dispersant additive. The Federal Court of Appeal concluded that the infringer might not need to disgorge all of its profits derived from the sale of the infringing product because some of the profits may be causally attributable to the motor oil itself, which the patentee did not invent:

It may be possible for Imperial to show that some part of the profits made on the infringing sales are not profits “arising from” the infringement in that they are not caused by but simply made on the occasion of such infringement. . . .

. . . Form must not be allowed to triumph over substance. While motor oil containing the dispersant additive was properly claimed in the patent (it would seem likely that the dispersant is useless except as an additive to motor oil) and while that claim was properly found to have been infringed, the reality is that Lubrizol did not invent motor oil and that Imperial’s motor oils contain other additives than the one here in issue. The terms of the judgment quoted by the Prothonotary in the above extract from his reasons make it plain that it is the presence of the additive (“carboxylic derivative compositions”) claimed in the Meinhardt patent which caused Imperial’s motor oils to infringe. Thus, it is possible that such oils have achieved their market share and attendant profits for reasons other than the presence of Lubrizol’s patented additive. A finding that Imperial’s motor oils infringed the Lubrizol patent does not necessarily amount to a finding that all the profits from the sales of such motor oils are profits arising from the infringement. That is an issue of fact to be decided on the reference.

. . .

. . . to allow Lubrizol to take profits which Imperial succeeds in showing were solely attributable to some non-infringing feature of its motor oil would be to judicially sanction Lubrizol’s unjust enrichment at Imperial’s expense. [Emphasis added; paras. 9-15.]

[57]                          The Federal Court of Appeal in Imperial Oil did not have the benefit of Schmeiser. However, its reasoning accords with that in Schmeiser. To isolate the profits causally attributable to the invention from the profits attributable to non-inventive features of the infringing product, the court would compare the infringer’s profits from the infringing product with what they would have earned with a non-infringing option: motor oil without the patented additive.

[58]                          In sum, a non-infringing option is any product that helps courts isolate the profits causally attributable to the invention from the profits which arose at the same time the infringing product was used or sold, but which are not causally attributable to the invention.

[59]                          A non-infringing option is not, as Nova and my colleague contend, an infringer’s “most profitable” alternative sales product that it “would have” and “could have” sold had it not infringed. This approach is flawed for two reasons.

[60]                          First, it is contrary to Schmeiser. Nova and my colleague’s argument is grounded on the incorrect premise that an accounting of profits is designed to ensure that the infringer ends up no worse off than had it never infringed (Côté J.’s reasons, at para. 146). But Schmeiser did not hold that the purpose of an accounting of profits was to determine what profits the infringer “could have earned” but for the infringement. Nor did it ever suggest that the focus was on the “value of the invention in the hands of the infringer” (Côté J.’s reasons, at para. 91; see also para. 118). These phrases are never used in Schmeiser. Nor are they present in the application of the law to the facts of Schmeiser¸ as there is no discussion in Schmeiser about what Mr. Schmeiser “could have earned” using non-infringing canola seeds. Instead, Schmeiser affirmed that the goal of an accounting of profits is to ensure that all profits causally attributable to the invention are disgorged to the patentee:

It is settled law that the inventor is only entitled to that portion of the infringer’s profit which is causally attributable to the invention . . . .

. . .

The difficulty with the trial judge’s award is that it does not identify any causal connection between the profits the appellants were found to have earned through growing Roundup Ready Canola and the invention. On the facts found, the appellants made no profits as a result of the invention. [Emphasis in original; paras. 101-3.]

[61]                          My colleague dismisses Schmeiser’s clear instruction that courts must focus on isolating the profits “causally attributable to the invention” (Schmeiser, at para. 101; see also para. 102). She suggests this explicit phrasing is an inadvertent ambiguity (Côté J.’s reasons, at para. 173). I cannot accept this. The language in Schmeiser is clear, unambiguous, and binding on this Court. I do not believe it would be appropriate for this Court to ignore this instruction from Schmeiser and adjust the focus of an accounting of profits to align with new terminology not used in the judgment.

[62]                          Second, this reading of non-infringing options would distort the purpose of an accounting of profits and, in turn, undermine the patent bargain underlying the Patent Act. If an infringer is allowed to use any prior profitable business venture as a non-infringing option, an infringer would always be incentivized to switch its business capacity to a more profitable infringing product. At worst, the infringer would keep all the profits they would have earned selling the non-infringing products that they sold before. At best, the infringer keeps some or all of the extra profits earned from infringement. Reading “non-infringing option” as Nova and my colleague suggest would have the effect of creating a form of business insurance for infringers: an infringer could always use their previous product lines as a non-infringing option and protect those profits in the event their new product infringes a patent.

[63]                          This distortion of the purpose of an accounting of profits gives rise to unacceptable consequences, one being that the quantum of profits to be disgorged would vary with the size of the infringing business and the breadth of its product lines. Nova’s suggested approach disproportionately benefits large corporations (like itself) that have diverse product lines. Such businesses have multiple products that they “could have” and “would have” produced had they not infringed. Nova, for example, produces numerous non-infringing plastics. In circumstances like these, my colleague’s reasons would provide no incentive not to infringe. At best, Nova would retain all profits from infringement. At worst, Nova could keep the profits it would have made on any of its other product lines. Nova’s approach would allow it and other large enterprises to infringe with relative impunity. This undermines the bargain provided for in the Patent Act.

[64]                          By contrast, smaller businesses would be disproportionately disadvantaged by Nova’s approach. The facts of Rivett are instructive. Mr. Rivett was unable to establish that he “could have” planted regular soybean seeds, as they were not available for purchase in his locale (Rivett, at para. 63). Despite this unavailability, under the reading of Schmeiser adopted in these reasons and by the Federal Court in Rivett, it was appropriate to consider regular soybean seeds as a relevant non-infringing option. Considering what profits Mr. Rivett would have earned with regular soybean seeds allowed the courts to isolate the “portion of the infringer’s profit which [was] causally attributable to the invention” (the patented genes that made the plants glyphosate herbicide˗resistant) from the profits attributable to non-patented features of the sold product (the soybean seed itself), as per the instructions in Schmeiser (para. 101).

[65]                          My colleague sees no issue with such consequences. In fact, she implies that Rivett was wrongly decided. In her view, Mr. Rivett should have been forced to disgorge all of his profits to Monsanto, including those not causally attributable to Monsanto’s invention (Côté J.’s reasons, at paras. 198-99). I cannot endorse such an outcome. This approach is detached from the Patent Act. It ties the profits to be disgorged to the size of the infringer’s business, while ignoring the value of a patent.

[66]                          In sum, I see no reason to depart from Schmeiser and adopt the definition of “non-infringing option” proposed by Nova and adopted by my colleague. While the approach advanced by Nova is in its interests, it has the result of favouring the strong and adversely affecting the weak, a consequence that accords with no principle of equity of which I am aware.

[67]                          Whether there is a non-infringing option that can assist courts in isolating the profits causally attributable to the invention is a question of fact. There are no strict rules around this factual exercise. Despite my colleague’s assertions that I hold otherwise, the non-infringing option need not be a strict market substitute for the patented product. The onus is on the infringer to adduce sufficient evidence to satisfy the court that the profits from its infringing product arose by virtue of features other than the patentee’s invention and that there is a non-infringing option that can help the courts isolate this value (Beloit, at p. 457; Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, at paras. 15-16; AFD Petroleum Ltd. v. Frac Shack Inc., 2018 FCA 140, 157 C.P.R. (4th) 195, at paras. 62-63). Typically, non˗infringing options will be most relevant when a patent covers only part of the product sold. In those situations, the profits generated by the sale of the infringing product may be attributable to inventive and non-inventive features of the product. But non-infringing options may also be relevant when the entire product sold is patented. Ultimately, “the question is whether the patent contributes the whole value of the thing that was sold, or merely a part”, “not whether the patent is the whole thing that was sold, or merely a part” (N. Siebrasse, “A Remedial Benefit-Based Approach to the Innocent-User Problem in the Patenting of Higher Life Forms” (2004), 20 C.I.P.R. 79, at p. 109 (emphasis in original)).

(5)         Application 

[68]                          In my view, the reference judge did not err when he concluded that all the profits Nova earned by selling the patented plastics were causally attributable to Dow’s invention. This is supported by two facts.

[69]                          First, the reference judge found that customers only purchased Nova’s infringing plastics because they contained the features captured by Dow’s patent, i.e., Nova sold the unique, patented thin and durable plastics covered by Dow’s patent. Dow’s invention had created a distinct market and Nova could only service that market because it sold infringing plastics. The two companies were the only companies serving the distinct market created by the patented plastics (F.C. reasons, at paras. 70 and 73-76).

[70]                          Second, Nova did not establish that there were relevant non-infringing options that would help the court isolate the profits causally attributable to Dow’s invention from profits attributable to non-inventive features of the infringing product. As explained earlier, the existence of an appropriate non-infringing option is a question of fact. Nova bore the evidentiary onus to establish this fact. It failed to discharge this onus. Before the reference judge, Nova conceded that there were no non-infringing options available for the purpose of applying the differential profits approach (F.C. reasons, at para. 146). This is also confirmed by the trial transcripts:

[Reference judge]: Now, here Nova is not seeking to deduct profits on foregone plastics. It merely wants to satisfy the court that the fixed costs would have been covered and therefore should be deducted.

 

[Nova’s trial counsel]: Right. That’s true.

 

(R.R., at p. 27)

[71]                          Nova reiterated this position at the Federal Court of Appeal. In Nova’s responding factum on cross-appeal, it wrote:

In Schmeiser, the Supreme Court recognized that the “preferred method” for achieving this goal is the differential profits approach — “where profits are allocated according to the value contributed to the defendant’s wares by the patent.” This method allocates only profits that the defendant derived as a result of the invention (i.e., profits that are causally attributable to the invention) by comparing them with profits that would have been earned on a true substitute or direct “non-infringing alternative” product.

All parties agreed that the differential profits method was not the appropriate method in this case. [Footnotes omitted.]

[72]                          Nova’s concession before the reference judge is sufficient to dispose of the appeal on this issue. Nova’s concession at trial is underscored by its continued concession at the Federal Court of Appeal. Permitting Nova to fundamentally alter its argument here would allow the company to treat this Court as one of first instance. It is not our role to make factual findings as to whether hypothetical profits from pail and crate plastics sales could assist with determining what portion of Nova’s profits were causally attributable to Dow’s invention. To evaluate Nova’s argument properly, this Court would need to re-evaluate the whole of the factual record. This is not our role.

[73]                          I also do not accept Nova’s request that we send this matter back to the reference judge for reconsideration. This decision affirms established law on an accounting of profits, as set out in Schmeiser. The reference judge did not misapply Schmeiser. There is no basis for sending the matter back for redetermination in these circumstances.

B.            Issue 2: Is Dow Entitled to Springboard Profits?

[74]                          An accounting of profits requires that the infringer disgorge all profits causally attributable to infringement of the invention, regardless of when the profits materialize. For example, if an infringer earns additional profits after the patent expires because of an accelerated entry into the market, the infringer should disgorge those post-patent-expiry profits. This principle is known as “springboard profits” or “springboard relief”.

[75]                          For the first time in Canadian law, the reference judge awarded springboard profits to Dow. The Federal Court of Appeal upheld this decision, agreeing with the reference judge that “springboard profits ‘are nothing more than a type of [gain] to be proven with evidence’” (F.C.A. reasons, at para. 126 (text in brackets in original), citing F.C. reasons, at para. 124).

[76]                          Nova challenges the decision to award springboard profits on three grounds. The company argues (1) that springboard profits are not legally permissible; (2) that Nova has already compensated Dow for its “ramp-up” into the market through its payment of a reasonable royalty (as described in para. 7 above); and (3) alternatively, that if springboard profits are legally permissible, the springboard profits should be reduced to account for the fact that Nova would have earned profits by selling pail and crate plastics had it not infringed.

[77]                          None of these arguments are persuasive. As I explain below, (1) springboard profits are legally permissible; (2) whether post-patent-expiry profits are causally attributable to patent infringement is a question of fact and Nova has not shown palpable and overriding error in the reference judge’s findings; and (3) for the reasons given above, Nova is not entitled to deduct the profits it could have earned from pail and crate plastics. There is therefore no basis to interfere with this part of the reference judge’s award to Dow.

(1)         Springboard Profits are Legally Permissible

[78]                          Nova submits that Canadian courts have never awarded springboard profits before. That is true. But Canadian courts have recognized and awarded springboard damages (AstraZeneca Canada Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2015 FC 671, at para. 7 (CanLII); Teva Canada Limited v. Janssen Inc., 2018 FCA 33, 420 D.L.R. (4th) 493, at paras. 107-12; Merck & Co., Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2013 FC 751, [2015] 1 F.C.R. 405, at para. 183, aff’d 2015 FCA 171, [2016] 2 F.C.R. 202; Apotex Inc. v. Eli Lilly and Company, 2018 FCA 217, 161 C.P.R. (4th) 411, at para. 114; see also Siebrasse, Stack et al., at pp. 96-97).

[79]                          The purpose underlying springboard damages is sound, having regard to the scheme and purposes of the Patent Act. A patent provides a time-limited monopoly to make, use, and sell an invention during the life of the patent (Patent Act, s. 42). This monopoly gives the patentee the right to build sales capacity and market share without any market competition. The patentee can then use this market advantage against competitors after the patent expires (M. E. Charles, “Monetary Remedies in Intellectual Property Litigation”, [2007] J. Bus. Valuation 159, at pp. 160 and 167).

[80]                          An infringer that begins selling the patented invention before the patent expires interferes with the patentee’s right to build sales capacity and market share in the absence of competition. This can reduce the patentee’s post-patent-expiry profits. If the patentee can prove that it lost sales post-patent-expiry as a result of infringing activity occurring during the life of the patent, the patentee is entitled to springboard damages to compensate for that loss.

[81]                          A corresponding purpose underlies an accounting of profits. By infringing during the life of the patent, the infringer can also build sales capacity and market share for their own version of the patented product. Then, after the patent expires, the infringer can use this sales capacity and market share to earn profits that it would not have earned but for the infringing activity that occurred during the life of the patent. Thus, a portion of such post-expiry profits may be causally attributable to infringement of the invention. Failing to disgorge those profits would leave gains that are causally attributable to infringement of the invention in the hands of the infringer. It would also be unfair to third parties that waited for patent expiry to compete with the patentee.

[82]                          I agree with the reference judge and the Federal Court of Appeal that springboard profits are “nothing more than a type of [gain] to be proven with evidence”. The Patent Act does not bar disgorgement of profits that materialize after patent expiry. To the contrary, artificially limiting an accounting of profits in the manner suggested by Nova would leave gains that are causally attributable to infringement of the invention in the hands of the infringer and thus undercut the bargain underlying the Patent Act. Judges should determine whether any profits earned post-patent-expiry are causally attributable to infringement of the invention during the period of patent protection. If they are, such profits should be disgorged.

(2)         The Reasonable Royalty Award Did Not Cover Nova’s Post-expiry Profits

[83]                          The reference judge found no support for Nova’s argument that its springboard profits were already accounted for by its payment of pre-grant reasonable royalties (paras. 122-24). The Federal Court of Appeal agreed. It held that royalties paid to cover the post-filing, pre-grant time period were unrelated to the quantum of profits Nova earned as a result of infringement of the invention, during the period of patent protection (paras. 137-40).

[84]                          Before this Court, Nova again argued that it had already compensated Dow for its “ramp-up” into the market by virtue of its payment of a reasonable royalty (as described in para. 7 above; see A.F., at para. 126). I see no merit in this argument. Disgorgement of springboard profits is a means to prevent an infringer from gaining from its infringement that is different from, but (in the circumstances of this case) complementary to, compensating a patentee by way of a reasonable royalty. The need to disgorge springboard profits is a factual question: are there any profits earned post-patent-expiry that are causally attributable to infringement of the invention, during the period of patent protection? Nova has not shown any palpable and overriding error in the reference judge’s findings in this regard.

(3)         Dow is Entitled to All Springboard Profits Causally Attributable to Infringement of the Invention

[85]                          In the alternative, Nova argues that the springboard profits should be reduced to account for the fact that, had it not infringed Dow’s patent, it would have earned profits by selling pail and crate plastics. For the reasons given above, I reject this argument. Like profits earned during the life of the patent, a patentee is entitled to all the infringer’s profits causally attributable to infringement of the invention, even if they materialize after the patent expires. Nova conceded that pail and crate plastics were not a non-infringing option, so no proper basis has been shown to reduce the reference judge’s springboard profits award in the circumstances.

VII.      Disposition

[86]                          For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

[87]                          Dow is entitled to its costs throughout.

I.               Overview

[88]                        This appeal concerns the principles that govern the remedy of an accounting of profits. Specifically, this appeal is about how an accounting of profits operates as a remedy for patent infringement. The appellant, Nova Chemicals Corporation, infringed a patent owned by the Dow Chemical Company and licensed to Dow Global Technologies Inc. and Dow Chemical Canada ULC (collectively “Dow”). The issues in the courts below related to the proper approach for an accounting of profits, an equitable remedy that has been aptly described as “ancient and notoriously difficult in practice” (Warman International Ltd. v. Dwyer (1995), 182 C.L.R. 544 (H.C.A.), at p. 556 (footnote omitted)).

[89]                        This appeal therefore provides our Court with an opportunity to elucidate how an accounting of profits operates as a remedy for patent infringement in a way that aligns with the purposes of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P‑4. An accounting of profits is a flexible, equitable remedy that applies differently depending on the context. The context of an infringement of intellectual property is quite different than other contexts in which an accounting of profits is available, such as that of a breach of a fiduciary duty. This difference has profound implications for how the remedy operates. Specifically, in the patent context, a more rigorous analysis of causation is both appropriate and necessary. This more rigorous analysis — epitomized in the differential profit approach — helps to properly isolate the profits to be disgorged. It ensures that the infringer disgorges only those profits that are causally attributable to the infringement of the patent.

[90]                        The differential profit approach was affirmed by this Court in Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser, 2004 SCC 34, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 902, as being the “preferred means of calculating an accounting of profits” for patent infringement (para. 102). This approach compares the actual profits earned by the infringer as a result of the infringement with the profits that it could have and would have earned had it not infringed the patent. In other words, it compares the infringer’s actual profits with its hypothetical profits from using its best non‑infringing option.

[91]                        As I will explain, the differential profit approach should have been available in this case. There is no principled reason why this approach should be available only where the hypothetical non‑infringing option is a true consumer substitute for the embodiment of the patent, which, in these reasons, I will refer to as the “patented product”. Rather, any hypothetical non‑infringing option that can be established in evidence — including one involving a product that services a different consumer market — can be used. However, the patent infringer must establish on a balance of probabilities that, but for the infringement, it could have and would have pursued this alternative course of action. The goal is not to isolate the value of the invention in the abstract. Rather, as is apparent from the application of Schmeiser, the goal is to isolate the profits causally attributable to the infringement. This determines the value of the invention in the hands of the infringer.

[92]                        Despite its claim to the contrary, I am of the respectful view that the majority — relying on a line of post‑Schmeiser damages cases — adopts a simplified method of calculating an accounting of profits in which the differential profit approach can be applied only when an infringer’s non‑infringing option would compete in the same consumer market as the patented product. At the very least, the majority claims that it is legally relevant whether the patented product and the potential non‑infringing option would compete in the same consumer market. The majority’s approach fails to give sufficient consideration to the equitable nature of the remedy and to its appropriate use in the patent context. The majority endorses an unclear approach to causation, upholding an award of profits in which the reference judge failed to sufficiently isolate the profits causally attributable to Nova’s infringement of Dow’s patent.

[93]                        The consequences of such an approach to causation are significant, both for the parties in this case and because of the precedent it establishes. For the parties, it leads to an inequitable outcome that, according to Nova, inflates the award of profits by over $300 million. This approach also distorts the goals of the Patent Act. Moreover, its purported simplicity is belied by its inability to isolate the profits causally attributable to the infringement in many plausible scenarios, including the case at hand. The majority’s analysis is also inconsistent. Indeed, when dealing with the profits the infringer earned during the life of the patent, the majority emphasizes that the causation analysis isolates the profits causally attributable to the invention. However, when dealing with profits earned after the expiry of the patent (i.e. springboard profits), the majority shifts the focus, emphasizing that the causation analysis isolates the profits causally attributable to the infringement. With respect, the majority’s method of calculating an accounting of profits is conceptually impoverished and doctrinally flawed.

[94]                        For the following reasons, I would allow the appeal and remit the matter to the Federal Court.

II.            Background and Context

[95]                        My colleague Rowe J. provides some general background relating to remedies in patent law, the calculation of an accounting of profits, and this Court’s decision in Schmeiser. However, and I say this with respect, I believe he has not sufficiently canvassed all of the concepts needed to fully understand the issues in this appeal. Similarly, while I agree with much of my colleague’s recitation of the facts and judicial history, there are significant contextual factors that are not discussed in his reasons.

[96]                        Below, I discuss important background relating to (1) the patent bargain and the remedies available for patent infringement and (2) the post‑Schmeiser case law regarding non‑infringing options that has developed in the Federal Courts. I then discuss important context pertaining to (3) the facts relating to Nova’s infringement of Dow’s patent and (4) the judicial history and the manner in which the case was argued in the courts below.

A.           Patent Bargain and Remedies Available for Patent Infringement

[97]                          The grant of a patent is not “an accolade or civic award for ingenuity” (Apotex Inc. v. Wellcome Foundation Ltd., 2002 SCC 77, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 153, at para. 37). Rather, the patent system is based on a bargain — that is, a quid pro quo — between the inventor and the public: “. . . the inventor is granted exclusive rights in a new and useful invention for a limited period in exchange for disclosure of the invention so that society can benefit from this knowledge” (Teva Canada Ltd. v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2012 SCC 60, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 625, at para. 32; see also Free World Trust v. Électro Santé Inc., 2000 SCC 66, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1024, at para. 13; Wellcome, at para. 37). The Patent Act therefore confers a time‑limited statutory monopoly. In exchange for disclosure of the invention, the patentee is granted “the exclusive right, privilege and liberty of making, constructing and using the invention and selling it to others to be used” (Patent Act, s. 42). The patent bargain is the fundamental policy rationale underlying the Patent Act (Teva, at para. 32).

[98]                          The infringement of the patentee’s statutory monopoly has been described as a statutory tort (S. J. Perry and T. A. Currier, Canadian Patent Law (4th ed. 2021), at §17.1; Bristol‑Myers Squibb Co. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 SCC 26, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 533, at para. 134, per Bastarache J., dissenting, but not on this issue). As this Court stated in Schmeiser, “the governing principle is whether the defendant, by his actions, activities or conduct, appropriated the patented invention, thus depriving the inventor, in whole or part, directly or indirectly, of the full enjoyment of the monopoly the patent grants” (para. 49). Liability thus arises from any breach of the patentee’s monopoly and is absolute. The infringer’s intention, or its knowledge about its use of the patent, is irrelevant (Schmeiser, at paras. 49 and 86).

[99]                          Once infringement has been proven, a number of different remedies are available to a successful plaintiff. Often, as in the case at bar, the issue of liability for patent infringement is bifurcated from the issue of calculating the proper monetary award.

[100]                     My colleague highlights three different remedies available under the Patent Act: reasonable compensation, damages, and an accounting of profits. With respect, a more comprehensive summary of damages and an accounting of profits is required. I provide such a summary below. However, before I elaborate in greater detail on these two remedies, it is important to emphasize that the remedies set out above are not the only ones available for patent infringement. Indeed, the Patent Act offers a number of other remedies to a successful plaintiff. Injunctive relief is available under s. 57(1)(a) of the Patent Act. Delivery up or destruction, in which the infringing product is ordered to be delivered up to the patentee or destroyed, are also available (Perry and Currier, at §§17.117‑17.118). Other remedies — such as legal costs, interest on an award of damages or profits, and punitive damages — are also available to a successful plaintiff (Perry and Currier, at §17.5).

(1)         Damages

[101]                     Damages may be awarded by a court for any monetary loss suffered by the patentee as a result of the patent infringement. The infringer is liable to the patentee for “all damage sustained . . . after the grant of the patent, by reason of the infringement” (Patent Act, s. 55(1)). Damages are compensatory and can include the following: lost profits on direct sales of the patented product; lost profits on sales of related goods or services; lost profits due to the depression of prices; lost profits due to increased costs; and lost profits on royalties from licensing agreements (Perry and Currier, at §§17.9 and 17.22‑17.35).

[102]                     The purpose of damages in the context of a patent infringement is the same as it is for other torts: to compensate the wronged party for the wrongdoing. Damages are therefore a loss‑based remedy aimed at making up the plaintiff’s loss. This remedy places the patentee in the position it would have been in but for the infringement (Perry and Currier, at §17.15).

[103]                     When calculating damages, courts strive to achieve perfect compensation: they want neither to overcompensate nor to undercompensate the plaintiff. It is noteworthy that this concern is particularly acute in the patent context. Undercompensation may discourage innovation. However, in Merck & Co., Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2015 FCA 171, [2016] 2 F.C.R. 202 (“Lovastatin”), the Federal Court of Appeal also discussed the equal problem of overcompensation:

At the heart of this bargain with the inventor, and at the heart of the Act, is the concept of balance between the benefit conferred on the public through the disclosure of a new and useful invention, and the benefit conferred on the inventor through the grant of a monopoly. Thus, in the event of infringement, under‑compensation of an inventor discourages research and development, and the disclosure of useful inventions. Equally, over‑compensation of an inventor chills potential competition to the extent that a potential infringer is uncertain about the scope and validity of a patent. The balance at the heart of the Act requires perfect compensation. [Emphasis added; para. 42.]

[104]                     Ultimately, the availability of damages as a remedy for patent infringement helps to preserve the patent bargain by ensuring that patentees are fully compensated for any damage they suffer as a result of the infringement.

(2)         Accounting of Profits

[105]                     An accounting of profits — sometimes referred to as an account of profits, the disgorgement of profits, or disgorgement — is an equitable remedy. It operates to strip the defendant of unlawful gains and is non‑punitive (Schmeiser, at para. 101; Lubrizol Corp. v. Imperial Oil Ltd., 1996 CanLII 4095 (FCA), [1997] 2 F.C. 3 (C.A.), at para. 15). As a gain‑based remedy, it is “calculated exclusively by reference to the defendant’s wrongful gain” (Atlantic Lottery Corp. Inc. v. Babstock, 2020 SCC 19, at para. 23). Gain‑based remedies stand in contrast to loss‑based remedies, such as compensatory damages or equitable compensation (Southwind v. Canada, 2021 SCC 28, at para. 67).

[106]                     The statutory basis for awarding an accounting of the infringer’s profits is s. 57 of the Patent Act, which states:

(1) In any action for infringement of a patent, the court, or any judge thereof, may, on the application of the plaintiff or defendant, make such order as the court or judge sees fit,

 

(a) restraining or enjoining the opposite party from further use, manufacture or sale of the subject-matter of the patent, and for his punishment in the event of disobedience of that order, or

 

(b) for and respecting inspection or account,

 

and generally, respecting the proceedings in the action.

[107]                     The statutory availability of an accounting of profits helps to uphold the patent bargain by ensuring that the infringer will not be able to retain any profits causally attributable to its infringement, even if the patentee suffers no compensable damage from the violation of its statutory monopoly. The remedy deters competitors from infringing a patentee’s statutory monopoly even where the infringement can be described as “efficient”. An efficient infringement — which is similar in nature to the concept of an efficient breach in contract law — is one in which an infringer’s profits arising from its infringement exceed the damages payable to the patentee. An accounting of profits therefore acts as a remedy to prevent an infringer from retaining any profits causally attributable to its infringement. This ensures that the patent monopoly is upheld and respected: only the patentee can exploit the invention for gain.

[108]                     Although an accounting of profits has been made statutorily available as a potential remedy, it has not been shorn from its equitable origins; it remains an equitable remedy. Lest it be forgotten, such remedies are always subject to the discretion of the court (Strother v. 3464920 Canada Inc., 2007 SCC 24, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 177, at para. 74), and equitable considerations apply when assessing whether a remedy is fit in the circumstances (Beloit Canada Ltd. v. Valmet‑Dominion Inc., 1997 CanLII 6342 (FCA), [1997] 3 F.C. 497 (C.A.), at paras. 106‑25; Bayer Aktiengesellschaft v. Apotex Inc. (2002), 2002 CanLII 18194 (ON CA), 16 C.P.R. (4th) 417 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 10‑15).

(3)         Election Between Damages and an Accounting of Profits

[109]                     Given that an accounting of profits is an equitable and discretionary remedy, a plaintiff in a patent infringement case does not have an absolute right to make an election between damages and an accounting of profits. The decision to award an accounting of profits, upon request, remains a discretionary one for the court. However, “[i]t is common practice in cases of patent infringement to allow a plaintiff to elect between damages and an accounting of profits” (Bayer Inc. v. Cobalt Pharmaceuticals Co., 2016 FC 1192, 142 C.P.R. (4th) 374, at para. 6, aff’d 2018 FCA 32, [2018] 4 F.C.R. 58; AlliedSignal Inc. v. Du Pont Canada Inc. (1995), 61 C.P.R. (3d) 417 (F.C.A.), at pp. 444‑46; Perry and Currier, at §17.80).

[110]                     In the case at hand, the issue of liability was bifurcated from the determination of the appropriate quantum of an award. After Dow successfully proved that Nova was liable for infringement of its patent, Dow was permitted “to elect after due inquiry and full discovery, either an accounting of profits of the defendant or all damages sustained by reason of infringement” (2014 FC 844, 129 C.P.R. (4th) 199, at para. 283).

B.            Post‑Schmeiser Case Law

[111]                     Since this Court’s decision in Schmeiser, case law has developed in the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal regarding how courts should determine the appropriate non‑infringing option, both in relation to claims for damages and in relation to claims for an accounting of profits. It is important to take account of these post‑Schmeiser decisions, as they ultimately played a significant role in the judicial history of this case.

[112]                     One line of cases that has developed in the Federal Court of Appeal pertains to the legal relevance of non‑infringing alternatives when calculating an award of damages (see, e.g., Lovastatin; Pfizer Canada Inc. v. Teva Canada Ltd., 2016 FCA 161, 400 D.L.R. (4th) 723 (“Pfizer (2016)”); AFD Petroleum Ltd. v. Frac Shack Inc., 2018 FCA 140, 157 C.P.R. (4th) 195; Apotex Inc. v. Eli Lilly and Company, 2018 FCA 217, 161 C.P.R. (4th) 411 (“Cefaclor”)). I note that this case law largely refers to a “non‑infringing alternative” rather than using the language from Schmeiser, in which the Court referred to a “non‑infringing option”.

[113]                     In Lovastatin, the Federal Court of Appeal recognized the legal relevance of a non‑infringing alternative when calculating damages. As it explained, where a defendant can make and sell a non‑infringing alternative to the embodiment of the patent, the patent does not give the patentee a complete monopoly on the market — the patentee has a monopoly on the invention, but consumers may also choose to purchase the non‑infringing alternative product (para. 48). Given that the patent does not confer a monopoly on the entire market for the product, the availability of a non‑infringing alternative becomes legally relevant when assessing a claim for damages. If “the infringer could and would have made and sold a non‑infringing alternative, these sales may well reduce the patent owner’s sales” (para. 49). Therefore, if the infringer can establish that it could have and would have produced a non‑infringing alternative product, the court can consider this when calculating the damages payable to the patentee. The infringer’s hypothetical sales of the non‑infringing alternative, which would have competed in the same market as the patentee’s product, reduce the number of sales that the patentee actually lost due to the infringement.

[114]                     However, as the Federal Court of Appeal noted in Lovastatin, “[w]hen considering the effect of legitimate competition from a defendant marketing a non‑infringing alternative, a court is required to consider [whether] the alleged non‑infringing alternative [is] a true substitute and thus a real alternative” (para. 73 (emphasis added)). In Cefaclor, the Federal Court of Appeal emphasized that consideration of whether the non‑infringing alternative is a true substitute is particularly important in non‑pharmaceutical patent infringement cases: this “very important question . . . usually turns on whether the product at issue would be considered a true substitute by the consumer” (para. 54 (emphasis added)).

[115]                     In the context of damages, there is some potential analytical value to the requirement that the infringer show that it could have and would have made an alternative product that would have competed in the same market as the patented product. It is the infringer’s hypothetical sales of the non‑infringing alternative that reduce the damages payable to the patentee because those sales reduce the patentee’s lost sales (and therefore lost profits). If the non‑infringing alternative were not a true alternative for the consumer such that it could not displace sales of the patented product, then it would not be legally relevant when calculating damages.

[116]                     A brief example is illustrative. A patentee has a patent on a specific product, which I will refer to as a patented widget. An infringer breaches the patentee’s statutory monopoly by selling 100 patented widgets. The patentee elects damages and argues that, but for the infringement, it would have sold 100 patented widgets, so the infringer’s unauthorized sales caused it (the patentee) to lose 100 sales. The infringer, however, can argue that it could have and would have sold a non‑infringing alternative to the patented widgets had it not infringed the patent. These unpatented widgets, while not identical to the patented ones, would have competed in the same market. If the infringer can show that it could have and would have sold, for example, 25 unpatented widgets, then the patentee’s lost sales would be reduced to 75.

[117]                     In summary, in the damages context, a non‑infringing alternative is relevant to the extent that the infringer’s hypothetical sales of the non‑infringing alternative reduce the patentee’s lost sales. The patentee’s lost sales — and its corresponding lost profits from those sales — are a head of damages. If the infringer can show that it could have and would have sold a non‑infringing alternative product that would have competed in the same market, then the patentee’s damages based on lost sales may be reduced.

[118]                     The damages case law dealing with non‑infringing alternatives has been cited approvingly in accounting of profits cases (see Apotex Inc. v. ADIR, 2017 FCA 23, 406 D.L.R. (4th) 572 (“ADIR (2017)”), at para. 34; Apotex Inc. v. ADIR, 2020 FCA 60, 172 C.P.R. (4th) 1 (“ADIR (2020)”), at paras. 48‑49). Indeed, there has been a convergence in the law with respect to damages and accounting of profits post‑Schmeiser. Since being decided in 2015, Lovastatin — including its requirement that a non‑infringing alternative be a “true substitute” for or “real alternative” to the patented product — has been applied in both damages cases and accounting of profits cases.

C.            Facts

(1)         Nova’s Infringement of Dow’s Patent

[119]                     In April 1994, Dow filed an application for a patent for “Fabricated Articles Made From Ethylene Polymer Blends”, which became Canadian Patent No. 2,160,705 (“705 Patent”). The patent was published in November 1994 but not issued until August 2006. Dow’s 705 Patent covers certain grades of polyethylene used to make plastic film products, like plastic garbage bags and food wrappings. Dow sold products made from its patented grades of polyethylene in Canada under the name “ELITE”.

[120]                     In December 2010, Dow sued Nova, claiming that the polyethylene marketed by Nova under the name “SURPASS” infringed the 705 Patent. Nova defended the claim, asserting that the 705 Patent was invalid. In September 2014, the Federal Court found that Dow’s patent was valid and that it had been infringed by Nova (2014 FC 844, 129 C.P.R. (4th) 199). This was affirmed on appeal (2016 FCA 216, 142 C.P.R. (4th) 339).

(2)         Nova’s Production of SURPASS

[121]                     Ethylene is a raw material used to make polyethylene. Ethylene was used by Nova in the production of both its infringing polyethylene, SURPASS, as well as other non‑infringing grades of polyethylene.

[122]                     Nova operated two primary business lines in Canada: (1) the Olefins unit, which produced ethylene; and (2) the Polyolefins unit, which produced polyethylene. Nova kept separate business records for the two units. These records indicate that Nova did not pay the market price for the ethylene used to manufacture SURPASS. Rather, as the reference judge found, it was able to produce ethylene in the Olefins unit “at a significant discount compared to the market price” (2017 FC 350, [2018] 2 F.C.R. 154, at para. 137). Nova paid an internal “transfer price” for that ethylene.

[123]                     During the period of patent infringement, Nova used a small quantity of its total ethylene production to make infringing grades of polyethylene. The rest of Nova’s ethylene was either sold to customers at market prices or used to make other non‑infringing grades of polyethylene, including “pail and crate” polyethylene.

D.           Judicial History

(1)         Reference Judge’s Decision: Federal Court, 2017 FC 350, [2018] 2 F.C.R. 154

[124]                     At trial, Nova conceded that there were “no ‘direct non‑infringing alternatives’” to the infringing SURPASS products (para. 146). Accordingly, it conceded that, based on its reading of post‑Schmeiser case law, the differential profit approach was unavailable. Nova then framed its argument about deducting ethylene costs, rather than profits, in the calculation of an accounting of profits. It argued that it should be permitted to deduct the market price of ethylene (i.e. the average third‑party selling price) rather than its actual incurred costs (i.e. the lower transfer price it paid). In the alternative, Nova argued that it should be permitted to deduct the full costs — which included variable, fixed, and capital costs — associated with its manufacture of ethylene (para. 134).

[125]                     The reference judge held that the differential profit approach was not available. When reciting the law on the availability of that approach, the judge cited Lovastatin, a damages case, holding that the infringer’s best non‑infringing option “must be a true substitute or real alternative” (para. 143). He also rejected Nova’s primary argument that it should be permitted to deduct the market price of ethylene rather than its actual incurred costs, as an “accounting of profits should be based on actual revenues and costs” (para. 139). However, he agreed with Nova’s alternative argument and permitted it to deduct its full costs, including both variable and fixed costs (para. 140).

[126]                     When calculating Nova’s deductible fixed costs associated with its manufacture of ethylene, the reference judge made the following important findings of fact:

I am satisfied that if Nova had not manufactured the infringing products, it would have worked assiduously to fill out the PE2 plant with other products: pail and crate or other resins that form part of Nova’s “product wheel”. I am further satisfied that Nova would have sold these other products within North America or to Asian markets. [para. 158]

[127]                     Ultimately, Nova was ordered to disgorge approximately $644 million to Dow (2017 FC 637).

(2)         Federal Court of Appeal Decision, 2020 FCA 141, [2021] 1 F.C.R. 551

[128]                     In the Court of Appeal, Nova recast its position, advancing two principal apportionment arguments. First, Nova argued that “had it not infringed Dow’s patent, it would have produced ethylene anyway and would have made lawful profits” from selling this ethylene at the market price (para. 90). Nova submitted that it should be credited for these hypothetical profits because it “would have earned . . . ethylene profits even without infringing” (para. 90, citing Nova’s revised memorandum of fact and law, at paras. 24, 55 and 56). Second, Nova argued that a portion of its profits was attributable to its unique ability to produce ethylene at a significant discount. These profits were not causally attributable to the patent but were instead attributable to Nova’s “Alberta Advantage”, and so they should be apportioned.

[129]                     The majority of the Federal Court of Appeal ultimately rejected both of these arguments, upholding the reference judge’s award of profits. It held that Nova’s first argument was purely hypothetical and therefore legally irrelevant to an accounting of profits. The majority further held that the reference judge had declined to make the requisite finding of fact with respect to that argument. The dissenting judge agreed with the majority’s recitation of the law. However, she concluded that the reference judge had erred by not considering the issue of causation, which pertained directly to the legal test of apportionment.

III.         Issues

[130]                     There are two main issues in this appeal. First, did the Federal Court of Appeal err in law by failing to apportion Nova’s ethylene profits in calculating the award to Dow? This turns on whether, as a matter of law, the differential profit approach can be applied only when an infringer’s best non‑infringing option is a true consumer substitute for the patented product.

[131]                     Second, did the Federal Court of Appeal err in law in upholding the award to Dow of springboard profits earned on products made and sold after the patent expired?

IV.         Analysis

[132]                     Given the complexity and difficulty associated with the accounting of profits remedy, a return to first principles is warranted. My analysis proceeds in three sections. First, I outline the principles governing an accounting of profits. Second, I assess whether the courts below erred in failing to apportion Nova’s ethylene profits by declining to apply the differential profit approach. This assessment entails consideration of whether, as a matter of law, an infringer’s best non‑infringing option needs to be a true consumer substitute for the patented product. Third, I assess whether the courts below erred in awarding springboard profits.

A.           Principles Governing an Accounting of Profits

(1)         Equitable Purposes That May Be Served by an Accounting of Profits

[133]                     While there are certain fundamental principles inherent in the operation of this remedy, the flexible and context‑sensitive nature of equitable remedies ensures that they are appropriately calibrated to address the wrong they are intended to redress. Indeed, as Dickson J. stated in Pettkus v. Becker, 1980 CanLII 22 (SCC), [1980] 2 S.C.R. 834, at pp. 847‑48, “[t]he great advantage of ancient principles of equity is their flexibility: the judiciary is thus able to shape these malleable principles so as to accommodate the changing needs and mores of society, in order to achieve justice.”

[134]                     For a proper understanding of how the remedy of an accounting of profits works in the patent context, it is important to begin by identifying the equitable purposes that may be served by this remedy. These purposes were examined in Strother, this Court’s leading case on the remedy. Strother involved a lawyer who had failed to advise a client about a favourable tax ruling from which the client could have benefited. In breach of his fiduciary duty, the lawyer had subsequently taken advantage of a business opportunity with another client related to that ruling, making millions in the process. The lawyer was ordered to account for the profits derived from the breach.

[135]                     Writing for the majority, Binnie J. stated that the remedy of “‘disgorgement’ of profit . . . may be directed to either or both of two equitable purposes”: (1) a prophylactic purpose aimed at deterring the wrongful conduct; and (2) a restitutionary purpose aimed at restoring profit that properly belongs to the plaintiff but has been wrongly appropriated by the defendant (paras. 75‑76 (emphasis added)). The restitutionary purpose is applicable, for example, to the “wrongful exploitation by the defendant of the plaintiff’s intellectual property” (para. 76).

[136]                     Before I elaborate in greater detail on how these two equitable purposes affect the operation of the remedy, a preliminary point of clarification is in order regarding the use of the term “restitution”. As this Court recently explained in Atlantic Lottery, restitution and disgorgement are two distinct gain‑based remedies: “. . . disgorgement requires only that the defendant gained a benefit (with no proof of deprivation to the plaintiff required), while restitution is awarded in response to the causative event of unjust enrichment . . ., where there is correspondence between the defendant’s gain and the plaintiff’s deprivation . . .” (para. 24 (emphasis omitted)).

[137]                     There is an apparent incongruity between the definition of “disgorgement” in Atlantic Lottery and the potential purpose of disgorgement as explained in Strother. In Atlantic Lottery, the Court stated that disgorgement and restitution are distinct gain‑based remedies, whereas, in Strother, it stated that disgorgement may have a restitutionary purpose. In my view, the description, in Strother, of disgorgement as having a restitutionary purpose is an example of the “inconsistent nomenclature” that has abounded in the jurisprudence (Atlantic Lottery, at para. 23). Properly understood, the restitutionary purpose referred to in Strother is more appropriately described as a restorative purpose. It functions to restore the wrongdoer’s improper gain to the plaintiff, as the gain properly belongs to the plaintiff.

[138]                     In the interests of “greater precision” and in order to avoid the “ambiguity inherent in such terminology” (Atlantic Lottery, at para. 23), I will refer to a restorative purpose rather than a restitutionary one. In my view, this more precise terminology accurately captures what was meant in Strother while avoiding the unnecessary confusion discussed in Atlantic Lottery. The purpose of the remedy is to restore the wrongdoer, as “the wrong disgorgement rectifies is the wrongdoer’s use of the claimant’s entitlement without consent. [The wrong] is not using the entitlement in combination with the wrongdoer’s own resources to produce wealth” (M. P. Gergen, “Causation in Disgorgement” (2012), 92 B.U.L. Rev. 827, at p. 830). “But for” causation is therefore appropriate, as the focus is on restoring the wrongdoer to the position it would have occupied but for its wrongdoing. Damages, which are a loss‑based remedy, restore the plaintiff to the position it would have been in but for the infringement. It is only logical that an accounting of profits, which focuses on the wrongdoer’s gains, seeks to restore the wrongdoer to the position it would have been in but for its wrongdoing (see Philip Morris Products S.A. v. Marlboro Canada Ltd., 2015 FC 364, [2015] F.C.J. No. 1564 (QL), at para. 17).

[139]                     Although he does not refer to Strother, my colleague describes an accounting of profits as a remedial tool that protects the patent bargain by (1) requiring infringers to disgorge the profits earned from patent infringement and (2) ensuring that infringers are deterred but not punished (Rowe J.’s reasons, at para. 44). It is unclear to me whether my colleague is affirming what was said in Strother, altering the terminology used in Strother (as I am doing), or departing from the discussion of the equitable purposes of an accounting of profits from Strother altogether.

(2)         Equitable Purposes Served by an Accounting of Profits in the Patent Context

[140]                     In order to highlight the equitable purposes served by an accounting of profits in the patent context, it is helpful, in my view, to contrast how the remedy operates in a fiduciary context. Indeed, as I said above, the focus of an accounting of profits in the patent context is quite different than it is in the context of a breach of a fiduciary duty. Specifically, in the patent context, the focus is on restoration — that is, restoring to the patentee the profits that the infringer gained as a result of its exploitation of the patented invention. Deterrence is not an overriding purpose, although it does play a limited role in helping to preserve the patent monopoly.

[141]                     My colleague, in his approach, fails to sufficiently identify and explain the equitable purposes served by an accounting of profits in the patent context. Since this Court’s decision in Strother, much of the accounting of profits case law has simply stated that this remedy has two equitable purposes: restitution and deterrence. At para. 44 of his reasons, my colleague cites ADIR (2020) for this proposition. With respect, that decision does not accurately describe what was said in Strother. This Court stated in Strother that the accounting of profits “remedy may be directed to either or both of two equitable purposes” (para. 75). In my view, it is important to understand conceptually how the remedy operates in the patent context and how its operation differs when there has been a breach of a fiduciary duty. I do not deny that an accounting of profits can have a deterrent purpose in the patent context, as it can deter intentional and efficient infringements. However, the primary purpose of the remedy in this context is restorative. Describing the deterrent purpose inaccurately risks distorting the causation analysis.

(a)      Purpose of an Accounting of Profits in the Fiduciary Context

[142]                     When there has been a breach of a fiduciary duty, the importance of the prophylactic deterrence purpose of the accounting of profits remedy cannot be understated. Equity abhors a breach of a fiduciary duty. This Court has long recognized the unique policy goals underlying fiduciary relationships, which equity seeks to uphold. As La Forest J. stated in Hodgkinson v. Simms, 1994 CanLII 70 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 377, at p. 453,

[t]he law of fiduciary duties has always contained within it an element of deterrence. . . . In this way the law is able to monitor a given relationship society views as socially useful while avoiding the necessity of formal regulation that may tend to hamper its social utility.

 

(See also Canadian Aero Service Ltd. v. O’Malley, 1973 CanLII 23 (SCC), [1974] S.C.R. 592, at pp. 607 and 610; Lac Minerals Ltd. v. International Corona Resources Ltd., 1989 CanLII 34 (SCC), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 574, at pp. 672‑73, per La Forest J.; Canson Enterprises Ltd. v. Boughton & Co., 1991 CanLII 52 (SCC), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 534, at pp. 571‑74, per La Forest J., and pp. 546‑47, per McLachlin J.)

[143]                     Equitable remedies are flexible and context-sensitive. As La Forest J., writing for the majority, stated in Canson,

[w]here a situation requires different policy objectives, then the remedy may be found in the system that appears more appropriate. This will often be equity. Its flexible remedies such as constructive trusts, account, tracing and compensation must continue to be moulded to meet the requirements of fairness and justice in specific situations. . . .

 

[E]quity cannot be rigidly applied. Its doctrines must be attuned to different circumstances. Quite obviously not all fiduciary obligations are the same. It would be wholly inappropriate to interpret equitable doctrines so technically as to displace common law rules that achieve substantial justice in areas of common concern, thereby leading to harsh and inequitable results. [p. 588]

[144]                     Given equity’s acute sensitivity to the need to preserve a fiduciary relationship and deter the faithless fiduciary, the absence of a fiduciary relationship may significantly attenuate the deterrence purpose of an equitable remedy. Indeed, in Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods Ltd., 1999 CanLII 705 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 142, which involved a breach of confidence in a non‑fiduciary relationship, Binnie J. emphasized that “[t]he overriding deterrence objective applicable to situations of particular vulnerability to the exercise of a discretionary power . . . does not operate here” (para. 30 (citations omitted)). This played a considerable role in weighing the equities of the case and fashioning the appropriate remedy.

(b)      Purposes of an Accounting of Profits in the Patent Context

[145]                     An accounting of profits may serve either or both of two equitable purposes: a restorative purpose and a prophylactic deterrence purpose. It does not need to serve both purposes. As Professor Devonshire explains, the function of an accounting of profits for an infringement of a patent is very different than it is for a breach of a fiduciary duty. When used to remedy a breach of a fiduciary duty, an accounting of profits “gives effect to concepts such as prophylaxis and the vindication of trust and confidence. In intellectual property cases the remedy reflects the more limited objective of disgorging gains attributable to infringement of the plaintiff’s interests” (P. Devonshire, Account of Profits (2013), at p. 131 (footnotes omitted)).

(i)            Restorative Purpose

[146]                     As noted, the restorative purpose of an accounting of profits in the patent context is to place the infringer in the position it would have been in but for the infringement. In the case of loss‑based remedies, such as damages or equitable compensation, the aim is to compensate the injured plaintiff, restoring it to the position it would have been in but for the infringement. However, an accounting of profits is a gain‑based remedy, so the focus is on the wrongdoer’s gains and the purpose is to restore the wrongdoer to the position it would otherwise have occupied by forcing it to disgorge the profits attributable to its wrongdoing.

(ii)         Prophylactic Deterrence Purpose

[147]                     With respect to the prophylactic deterrence purpose of an accounting of profits, in my view, there is no overriding deterrence objective in the patent context. As in Cadbury Schweppes, the absence of a fiduciary relationship means that deterrence is not an overriding objective. Moreover, there are countervailing policy concerns about overdetermined gains (i.e. windfalls) and over‑deterrence that are especially acute with respect to the disgorgement of profits, particularly in the patent context. This Court discussed concerns about over‑deterrence in this context in Free World Trust. In my view, Binnie J.’s comments at para. 42 remain apposite:

The patent system is designed to advance research and development and to encourage broader economic activity. Achievement of these objectives is undermined however if competitors fear to tread in the vicinity of the patent because its scope lacks a reasonable measure of precision and certainty. A patent of uncertain scope becomes “a public nuisance” (R.C.A. Photophone, Ld. v. Gaumont‑British Picture Corp. (1936), 53 R.P.C. 167 (Eng. C.A.), at p. 195). Potential competitors are deterred from working in areas that are not in fact covered by the patent even though costly and protracted litigation (which in the case of patent disputes can be very costly and protracted indeed) might confirm that what the competitors propose to do is entirely lawful. Potential investment is lost or otherwise directed. Competition is “chilled”. The patent owner is getting more of a monopoly than the public bargained for. There is a high economic cost attached to uncertainty and it is the proper policy of patent law to keep it to a minimum. [Emphasis added.]

[148]                     I recognize that Binnie J. was discussing the need to ensure that the boundaries of a patent are both fair and reasonably predictable. In my view, the same logic applies to the disgorgement remedy. The remedy should not punish potential competitors for competing in areas they reasonably believe are not properly covered by a patent: if a patentee were able to obtain a windfall by being awarded the infringer’s profits that were not causally attributable to the infringement, the remedy would become punitive and the scope of the patent monopoly would be unduly expanded. The patent bargain would be distorted and competition would be chilled.

[149]                     Concerns about over‑deterrence have also been common in the academic literature on the accounting of profits remedy, both generally and in the patent context (see, e.g., Devonshire, at pp. 58‑71 and 131‑33; Gergen, at p. 837; C. B. Seaman et al., “Lost Profits and Disgorgement”, in C. B. Biddle et al., eds., Patent Remedies and Complex Products: Toward a Global Consensus (2019), 50, at pp. 60 and 72‑73; T. F. Cotter, Comparative Patent Remedies: A Legal and Economic Analysis (2013), at p. 69; N. Siebrasse, “A Remedial Benefit‑Based Approach to the Innocent‑User Problem in the Patenting of Higher Life Forms” (2004), 20 C.I.P.R. 79, at pp. 96‑98).

[150]                     I further note that any significant deterrent purpose of an accounting of profits in this context was effectively rejected by the Federal Court of Appeal in ADIR (2017). In that case, the lower court had dismissed the relevance of using a non‑infringing option. According to the Federal Court, if the infringer could establish a non‑infringing option in which it made the same hypothetical profits, it would have “a perfect shelter against the consequences of any future patent infringement in Canada” (ADIR v. Apotex Inc., 2015 FC 721, 482 F.T.R. 276, at para. 121). However, the Federal Court of Appeal appropriately, and in a manner consistent with this Court’s decision in Schmeiser, rejected the concern about a “perfect shelter”. It emphasized that other available remedies — such as elevated costs, injunctive relief and punitive damages — counterbalance any incentive to infringe (Lovastatin, at para. 71).

[151]                     To be clear, I am not saying that an accounting of profits does not have any deterrent purpose in the patent context. However, in this context, the deterrent effect of disgorgement is limited and must be viewed in conjunction with other available remedies. Specifically, the statutory availability of an accounting of profits helps to deter infringement to the extent that it ensures that, even if the patentee suffers no or minimal compensable damage, the infringer will not be able to retain any profits causally attributable to its infringement. The remedy therefore deters competitors from intentionally infringing a patent even where the infringement can be described as “efficient”. This ensures that the patent monopoly is upheld and respected.

(3)         Role of Causation

[152]                     Given the different purposes of an accounting of profits, the question becomes how this equitable remedy operates in different circumstances. The answer to this question lies in the approach to causation. For both a breach of a fiduciary duty and a patent infringement, a causal relationship between the breach or infringement and the profits is required (Strother, at para. 79; Schmeiser, at para. 101; Lubrizol).

[153]                     However, there are important differences in how causation is approached. A comparison between the causation analysis in Strother and that in Schmeiser is illustrative. Differences in context justify the subtle, yet significant, differences in the approach to causation. This is entirely consistent with the flexible nature of equitable remedies (see, e.g., Hodgkinson, at p. 443). My intention here is to illuminate the differences in the causation analysis generally. I should not be understood as providing comprehensive guidance on how an accounting of profits operates for a breach of a fiduciary duty. That is not at issue in this appeal.

(a)         Apportionment Is Inappropriate When Deterrence Is the Overriding Purpose

[154]                     In Strother, this Court ordered the faithless fiduciary to “account for profit earned from the personal financial opportunity he pursued in breach of his fiduciary duty” (para. 85). The Court emphasized that Mr. Strother “must disgorge profits related to his breaches of loyalty” and that “[i]f the prophylactic purpose of the equitable remedy is to be achieved, [Mr.] Strother cannot be permitted to pocket the money thus derived from a personal interest in conflict with his fiduciary duty” (paras. 86‑87).

[155]                     Before this Court, Mr. Strother argued that he should be permitted to apportion his profits depending on the extent to which they were attributable to the breach. Binnie J. rejected the apportionment argument, emphasizing the prophylactic deterrence purpose of the remedy in this context:

In my view, this is not a case for apportionment. The Court’s purpose here is prophylactic rather than restitutionary. We are not therefore engaged in allocating an amount of profit amongst different contributing sources (or “profit drivers”). Strother acquired a personal financial interest in one client that conflicted with his duty to provide full and candid advice to another concurrent client. He should not be permitted to profit from that conflicting interest even though it is justly said that his own skill and experience were major contributors to those profits. Apportionment in these circumstances would reward the breach and undermine achievement of the prophylactic purpose. [Emphasis added; emphasis in original deleted; para. 96.]

[156]                     The gravity of the wrongdoing and equity’s concern for preserving the integrity of fiduciary relationships may therefore influence the strictness of limiting principles such as causation (P. Devonshire, “Account of Profits for Breach of Fiduciary Duty” (2010), 32 Sydney L. Rev. 389, at pp. 394‑404). The prophylactic deterrence purpose of an accounting of profits “advances the policy of equity, even at the expense of a windfall to the wronged [party]” (Strother, at para. 77). In these circumstances, apportionment — that is, the allocation of profits among different sources — may be inappropriate. As Professor Gergen notes, “the usual test of but‑for causation gives way to an expanded test to treat conduct as a cause of an event despite an imagined (and sometimes a non‑imagined) competing cause if reasons of policy or fairness justify disregarding the competing cause” (p. 835).

[157]                     In contrast, the absence of a comparable and overriding deterrent purpose in a patent infringement case means that there is an intense focus on the profits causally attributable to the infringement. This is epitomized by the differential profit approach, which seeks to isolate the various “profit drivers”, to use the term from Strother, that are attributable to the infringer’s unauthorized use of the patentee’s invention.

(b)         Differential Profit Approach

[158]                     In the patent context, there is an acute focus on causation: it is settled law that the patentee is entitled only to the profits causally attributable to the infringement of the patent (Schmeiser, at para. 101; Lubrizol). However, isolating these profits has proven notoriously difficult, which is evident from both the jurisprudence and the academic commentary.

[159]                     In Reading & Bates Construction Co. v. Baker Energy Resources Corp., 1994 CanLII 3524 (FCA), [1995] 1 F.C. 483 (C.A.), at p. 493, Létourneau J.A. noted that “the exercise of this remedy has been associated with a number of practical difficulties” (see also AlliedSignal, at pp. 444‑46; Beloit, at para. 113; Constellation Brands US Operations Inc. v. Société de vin internationale ltée, 2021 QCCA 1664, at paras. 38‑40 (CanLII)).

[160]                     Academics have similarly noted the challenges posed by the apportionment of profits in the patent infringement context. For example, Professor Siebrasse describes the challenges faced by courts when attempting to apportion profits among different profit drivers:

The goal of an accounting of profits is to force the wrongdoer to disgorge all profits made by the defendant as a result of his infringement. This can quickly lead to difficult questions, because profits may spring from the use of many complementary non‑infringing assets. The traditional solution was to award the plaintiff only that portion of the defendant’s overall profits which was attributable to the infringement. Determining when and how to conduct this “apportionment” of profits has been among the most difficult legal questions . . . . [Emphasis added; endnote omitted.]

 

(N. V. Siebrasse, A. J. Stack et al., “Accounting of Profits in Intellectual Property Cases in Canada (2007)” (2008), 24 C.I.P.R. 83, at p. 112; see also L. Bently et al., Intellectual Property Law (5th ed. 2018), at pp. 1348‑49; L. Smith and J. Berryman, “Disgorgement of Profits in Canada”, in E. Hondius and A. Janssen, eds., Disgorgement of Profits: Gain‑Based Remedies throughout the World (2015), 281, at pp. 292‑93.)

[161]                     The difficulties inherent in the apportionment exercise were significantly reduced by this Court’s decision in Schmeiser, in which the differential profit approach was affirmed as being the “preferred means of calculating an accounting of profits” in relation to infringements of intellectual property rights (para. 102). Indeed, there is a principled reason why the differential profit approach is the preferred approach in this context: it best approximates the causal contribution of the infringement.

[162]                     The differential profit approach isolates the profits earned by the infringer as a result of the infringement. This approach therefore isolates the value of the patent in the hands of the infringer. It does so by comparing the infringer’s actual profits with its hypothetical profits had it used the best non‑infringing option (Schmeiser, at para. 102). In other words, this approach compares actual profits with the profits that could have and would have been earned but for the infringement.

[163]                     This is why the differential profit approach has also been called the “value‑based” approach. Through a comparison between actual profits and hypothetical profits based on the best non‑infringing option, the differential profit approach subsumes the apportionment analysis. Once the profits causally attributable to the infringement have been isolated, “[n]o other apportionment would appear to be necessary to restore the [infringer] to the position it would have occupied, but for the infringement” (Cotter, at p. 205).

[164]                     In my view, there is no doubt that this is what the Court intended to lay down as the governing test in Schmeiser. A brief examination of the history of the remedy of an accounting of profits leading up to that case will demonstrate this.

[165]                     Prior to Schmeiser, the differential profit approach had been rejected by the Federal Court of Appeal in Reading & Bates. The language used by the court is telling: “. . . one has to look at the profits that the appellant actually made through the infringing acts, not the profit that he could have made had he used a non‑infringing method” (p. 496; see also Wellcome Foundation Ltd. v. Apotex Inc., 2001 CanLII 22028 (FCA), [2001] 2 F.C. 618 (C.A.), at paras. 19‑21).

[166]                     While the Court in Schmeiser did not rely on the Federal Court of Appeal’s jurisprudence, it did refer to Celanese International Corp. v. BP Chemicals Ltd, [1999] R.P.C. 203. In that case, the English High Court engaged in an extensive discussion on the point at issue here. Laddie J. described two approaches to an accounting of profits: the “incremental” or differential profit approach and the “apportionment” approach. The first was explained as follows by counsel for BP Chemicals Ltd.: “The correct approach in assessing the profits derived from infringement is to assess the value of the benefits arising from using the guard bed, compared to the alternative which BP were most likely to have used otherwise, absent infringement” (para. 16). In other words, the differential profit approach relies on “but for” causation to put the defendant in the position it would have been in but for the infringement. The second approach, which Laddie J. adopted, was described by him as follows: “Apportionment looks at the profits actually made on the whole process or article and, where appropriate, splits them between those parts which infringe and those which do not” (para. 34). He added that it “should not matter that similar profits could have been made in another, non‑infringing way” (para. 39).

[167]                     Thus, Laddie J. expressly rejected the differential profit approach in favour of apportionment. While Celanese was cited by this Court in Schmeiser, at para. 101, for the proposition that causal attribution of profits is necessary, it is plain that the apportionment approach was rejected in favour of the differential profit approach using “but for” causation in the very next paragraph. It can hardly be suggested that this Court had not read Laddie J.’s judgment when it decided Schmeiser. Yet that is what is suggested by my colleague’s reasons, insofar as he reads Schmeiser as not requiring the application of the “but for” test and instead requiring courts to focus exclusively on the abstract value of the invention.

[168]                     The facts of Schmeiser confirm this analysis. Mr. Schmeiser had been ordered by the Court of Appeal to account for all of the profit obtained from his crops, “not the difference between that profit and the profit from the sale of an alternative crop that was not grown” (Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser, 2002 FCA 309, [2003] 2 F.C. 165, at para. 79). But that difference is precisely what this Court ordered, i.e., $0. Mr. Schmeiser was therefore restored to the position he would have been in had he not infringed the patent.

[169]                     Further support for my proposition is evidenced by the fact that, in Schmeiser, this Court cited Siebrasse (2004). A single excerpt from that article suffices to show that Professor Siebrasse — and, by extension, the majority in Schmeiser — preferred the “but for” test which my colleague now rejects:

The argument in favour of the differential-profit approach is that it is simply the application of “but for” causation to an accounting of profits.

 

. . . the causation requirement leads directly to the conclusion that the plaintiff is not entitled to all her loss, but only to her “differential loss” — namely, the difference between the “injured position,” which is the plaintiff’s position in fact, and the “original position,” which the plaintiff would have been in but for the wrong.

 

From this we see that the differential‑profit approach to an accounting is simply a more specialized statement of this general principle. It says that the defendant’s profit caused by the infringement is the difference between the profit that the defendant in fact made and the profit that the defendant would have made but for the infringement, on the supposition that but for the infringement the defendant would have used the next best non‑infringing method. [Emphasis added; p. 91.]

Thus, it was indeed held in Schmeiser that the “purpose of an accounting of profits was to determine what profits the infringer ‘could have earned’ but for the infringement”, at least insofar as doing so is necessary to restore the infringer to the position it would have been in had it not infringed the patent (Rowe J.’s reasons, at para. 60).

[170]                     As I note further below, a few years before it decided in this case, the Federal Court of Appeal itself held that “but for” reasoning was essential to the calculation of an accounting of profits. In ADIR (2017), at para. 40, it stated that “the [c]ourt is to consider a hypothetical world where the infringing conduct did not take place”. To put the point beyond any doubt, the court said the following:

For clarity, the issue I would remit to the Federal Court is whether Apotex would have and could have obtained quantities of non‑infringing perindopril . . . and, if so, whether Apotex would have and could have used non‑infringing perindopril for sales to its affiliates in the United Kingdom and Australia. [Emphasis added; para. 65.]

And mere months prior to rendering judgment in this case, the Federal Court of Appeal had resort to the differential profit approach as I apply it (ADIR (2020)).

[171]                     In sum, and with respect, contrary to what Stratas J.A. said in the decision under appeal — and to what my colleague now states — consideration of what the defendant could have and would have done is of central importance to the calculation of profits on an accounting, as it helps to restore the defendant to the position it would have been in but for the infringement. I would add that it is unclear to me on what basis the Federal Court of Appeal departed from its own precedents.

[172]                     My colleague criticizes me for stating that the focus of an accounting of profits is on the “value of the invention in the hands of the infringer”, as this phrase was “never used in Schmeiser” and it would be inappropriate for this Court to “adjust the focus of an accounting of profits to align with new terminology not used in the judgment” (paras. 60‑61). It is unclear what, specifically, my colleague finds objectionable about this phrase. In my view, it is simply another way of stating that the infringer must disgorge the profits causally attributable to the infringement — this is precisely why the court examines and isolates the value derived from the infringer’s use of the invention.

[173]                     With respect, I am of the view that the phrase “causally attributable to the invention”, which was used in Schmeiser, at para. 101, is ambiguous and creates confusion. It seems to imply that an accounting of profits is intended to value the patent in the abstract rather than to remedy a specific infringement by a specific defendant at a specific point in time. To the extent that my colleague is suggesting that the purpose of an accounting of profits is to value the patent in the abstract, I disagree and I believe that this is a misreading of Schmeiser. The phrase “causally attributable to the invention” should not be understood in that manner. Rather, the purpose is to isolate the value of the patent in the hands of the infringer. My interpretation of Schmeiser, and my consistent use of the phrase “causally attributable to the infringement”, are preferable for four reasons.

[174]                     First, although it is not included in my colleague’s block quotation at para. 60 of his reasons, the phrase “causally attributable to the invention” used in Schmeiser was cited to Lubrizol and Celanese, at para. 37. Both of these cases clearly indicate that the focus is on the wrongdoing — that is, the infringement of the patent — and not on the purported abstract value of the patent. In Lubrizol, for example, the Federal Court of Appeal stated: “It may be possible for Imperial to show that some part of the profits made on the infringing sales are not profits ‘arising from’ the infringement in that they are not caused by but simply made on the occasion of such infringement” (para. 9 (emphasis added)). In Celanese, the court similarly underscored that the proper focus is on the infringement:

Although an account may give rise to a very different figure to that on an inquiry as to damages, they both proceed on a common principle of legal causation. On an inquiry the court is trying to determine what damage has been caused, in a legal sense, by the defendant’s wrongful acts. It has to decide whether the breach was the cause of the loss or merely the occasion of it . . . . In an account the court is trying to determine what profits have been caused, in a legal sense, by those acts. [para. 37]

[175]                     Second, the application of the differential profit approach in Schmeiser also confirms that the focus is on the infringement. In Schmeiser, Monsanto’s patent pertained to genetically modified genes and cells that could be inserted into plants to increase their tolerance to glyphosate herbicides such as Roundup. Canola seed containing the patented genes and cells was marketed under the name “Roundup Ready Canola”. It was not the abstract value of the patented invention that mattered, but rather the value of the patented invention in Mr. Schmeiser’s hands. Because Mr. Schmeiser had not sprayed his fields with Roundup, he had gained no “agricultural advantage” and his “profits were precisely what they would have been” but for the infringement (para. 104 (emphasis added)).

[176]                     Third, a narrow interpretation that focuses exclusively on the value of the invention, and not on the value derived from the infringement, is inconsistent with the proposition that the profits to be disgorged are those that, “on a common sense view of causation, were caused by the breach” (Schmeiser, at para. 101, quoting Canson, at p. 556 (emphasis added)). The phrase “a common sense view of causation” clarifies that “but for” causation applies, even though other common law requirements for legal causation, such as foreseeability and remoteness, do not readily apply in equity (Southwind, at para. 75). The application of common sense “but for” causation is therefore appropriate when isolating the profits causally attributable to the infringement.

[177]                     Fourth, a focus on the infringement, rather than on the purported value of the invention, is necessary to capture all of the potential profits that the infringer may derive from its breach of the patentee’s statutory monopoly. There is a difference between looking, in the abstract, at the value that the patent brings to the product and looking at the value that resulted from the infringement. Professor Siebrasse articulates this difference clearly:

No one knows the value contributed by the inventive quality of the patented technology and it does not matter. The rationale for the patent system is that it provides an incentive to invent. That incentive is provided by the private return to the patentee from exploiting the invention. In a world without any infringement, that private return is determined by the advantage that the patentee is able to extract in real‑world competition with various rivals using non‑infringing technology. The advantage of the patented technology over the non‑infringing options does not turn solely on whatever value we might decide is attributable to the inventive quality of the technology; it turns on the actual difference in profitability, which in turn does depend on things like distribution advantages, including the practical availability or otherwise of the putative alternatives, as well as all the other elements that go into making a real product and bringing it to market.

 

. . .

 

. . . The benefit as a result of the infringement is typically not the value attributable to the inventive quality of the patented technology; it is the difference between what the infringer in fact made and what it would have made in the “but for” world in which it used the best non‑infringing option.

[Emphasis in original.]

 

(N. Siebrasse, Non‑Infringing Baseline as an Alternative to “But For” Causation, October 19, 2020 (online))

[178]                     With respect, I am of the view that my colleague is imprecise and inconsistent in describing the focus of an accounting of profits. In most of his reasons, he refers to this focus as being the disgorgement of profits “causally attributable to the invention” (see, e.g., paras. 1, 3, 12‑13, 15, 40, 46‑48, 50‑53, 55, 57‑58, 60‑61, 64, 67 and 71 (emphasis added)). However, when discussing springboard profits in particular, my colleague describes the focus of this remedy as being the disgorgement of profits “causally attributable to infringement of the invention” (e.g., paras. 4, 27, 74, 81‑82 and 84‑85 (emphasis added)).

[179]                     My colleague needs this shift in focus to justify his conclusion on springboard profits. Without this shift, he would not be able to justify an award of springboard profits, as such profits have absolutely nothing to do with the purported “value of the invention”. They are the profits the infringer earns after the expiry of the patent that can be attributed to the infringement of the patentee’s statutory monopoly during the life of the patent. By infringing the patent during the life of the patent, the infringer builds sales and market share that increase its profits after the patent expires. In short, springboard profits are profits that an infringer derives from its infringement, rather than profits derived from the purported value of the invention itself.

[180]                     I am of the respectful view that the phrase “causally attributable to infringement of the invention” is inaccurate and incompatible with the nature of patent infringement. An infringer that uses a patented invention without authorization does not infringe the invention; rather, it infringes the patent itself, which is the patentee’s statutory monopoly over the use and exploitation of the invention.

[181]                     Moreover, I would note that this phrase is novel, as it is conspicuously absent from Schmeiser. If, as my colleague states, the exact language from Schmeiser is “clear, unambiguous, and binding on this Court” such that it would be inappropriate to “adjust the focus of an accounting of profits to align with new terminology not used in the judgment”, then he must justify an award of springboard profits in light of exactly what was stated in Schmeiser: “. . . the inventor is only entitled to that portion of the infringer’s profit which is causally attributable to the invention . . .” (Rowe J.’s reasons, at para. 61; Schmeiser, at para. 101 (emphasis added)). With respect, my colleague cannot have it both ways. He cannot criticize my approach, which focuses on the value derived from the infringement, while also adopting it when calculating springboard profits. Profits earned during the life of the patent cannot and should not be calculated in a different manner than profits earned after its expiry.

[182]                     Relatedly, my colleague’s reasons largely avoid any use of the words “but for” or “hypothetical”. His reasons refer to “hypothetical” profits only twice (at paras. 3 and 72), and “but for” is used only when discussing springboard profits (para. 81). This merely adds to the confusion about the proper operation of the differential profit approach. It is especially problematic given the obvious “tension between two Federal Court of Appeal panels on the use of a ‘but‑for’ analysis in cases involving accounting of profits” (Perry and Currier, at §17.60). The decisions to which the authors refer are the one at issue in this appeal and ADIR (2020). While my colleague cites the latter case at various points in his reasons, it is unclear to me which approach he endorses. Is hypothetical “but for” reasoning prohibited in an accounting of profits, or is it permissible? Or is such reasoning permissible only when calculating springboard profits? My colleague does not address these issues.

[183]                     Clearly, in my view, hypothetical “but for” reasoning is both appropriate and necessary when applying the differential profit approach. This approach is inherently premised on the creation of a hypothetical “but for” world. This Court’s decision in Schmeiser and subsequent jurisprudence from the Federal Court of Appeal clearly demonstrate the relevance of such reasoning (see, e.g., Schmeiser, at para. 104; ADIR (2017), at paras. 40‑41, 61, 71 and 79; ADIR (2020), at paras. 47‑51).

[184]                     The academic literature on an accounting of profits in patent cases has also discussed the relevance of “but for” causation and the creation of reasonable hypotheticals (see, e.g., Cotter, at pp. 197 and 205; Siebrasse, Stack et al., at pp. 89, 112‑13 and 121‑22; Siebrasse (2004), at pp. 91‑93; Seaman et al., at p. 50; Gergen, at p. 832; Devonshire (2013), at p. 133; Perry and Currier, at §§17.59‑17.63; Smith and Berryman, at p. 292).

[185]                     To summarize, the focus of an accounting of profits in the patent context must be on the infringer’s profits that are causally attributable to its infringement. In other words, what profits did the infringer earn as a result of its infringement of the patentee’s statutory monopoly and its exploitation of the invention? This is determined using “but for” causation. This approach is consistent with the gain‑based nature of the remedy and ensures that the analysis remains unwaveringly focused on the infringer and the profits it earned — whether during the life of the patent or after its expiry — as a result of its infringement.

B.            The Differential Profit Approach Should Have Been Available

[186]                     In my view, this appeal directly raises the following legal questions. First, does a non‑infringing option have to be a true substitute (i.e. a consumer substitute) for the patented product? This is a key issue raised by Nova both in its factum and in oral argument. Dow also addressed this issue in its factum as well as in oral argument. Second, how are courts to determine the appropriate hypothetical “best non‑infringing option” to be used? I will answer these questions in turn.

(1)         An Infringer’s Best Non‑Infringing Option Does Not Need to Be a True Consumer Substitute

[187]                     For the reasons that follow, I conclude that, under the differential profit approach, a non‑infringing option does not need to be a true consumer substitute for the patented product. There are two principled reasons for this conclusion: (1) a true consumer substitute requirement is legally irrelevant in an accounting of profits given the different purposes and focus of this remedy when compared to damages; and (2) limiting non‑infringing options to true consumer substitutes distorts the causation analysis.

(a)           A True Consumer Substitute Requirement Is Legally Irrelevant Given the Different Purposes and Focus of an Accounting of Profits

[188]                     An accounting of profits and damages are two remedies that ultimately serve different purposes and therefore have a different focus (Snell’s Equity (34th ed. 2020), by J. McGhee and S. Elliott, at para. 20‑037). A true consumer substitute requirement is legally irrelevant in an accounting of profits in light of the different purposes and focus of this remedy.

[189]                     To reiterate, an award of damages is compensatory. An infringer’s hypothetical sales of a non‑infringing product are legally relevant to the extent that they reduce the patentee’s lost sales of the patented product. This can be the case only if the two products would have competed in the same market. In contrast, an accounting of profits is not compensatory, as the profits to be disgorged “are calculated exclusively by reference to the defendant’s wrongful gain, irrespective of whether it corresponds to damage suffered by the plaintiff” (Atlantic Lottery, at para. 23). It is therefore legally irrelevant whether consumers would view the product that the infringer could have and would have made in the hypothetical world as a substitute for the patented product. What matters is the profits the infringer derived from its breach of the patentee’s statutory monopoly. This is most accurately determined through the differential profit approach, which uses “but for” causation to identify the infringer’s best non‑infringing option.

[190]                     My colleague states that “[t]here are no strict rules” concerning the “factual exercise” of determining whether there is a non‑infringing option and that such an option “need not be a strict market substitute for the patented product” (para. 67). In my view, the elimination of a “strict” requirement that the non‑infringing option be a true consumer substitute is a positive and welcome development. However, and with respect, my colleague’s analysis, and his upholding of the reference judge’s legal conclusion, are problematic for three reasons.

[191]                     First, the reference judge’s two factual findings on which my colleague relies clearly show that the “distinct [consumer] market” remained central and legally relevant in the judge’s analysis. According to my colleague, the reference judge did not err in holding that there were no non‑infringing options because, for one thing, customers that purchased Nova’s SURPASS did so due to the features captured by Dow’s patent, as Dow’s invention had “created a distinct market and Nova could only service that market because it sold infringing plastics” (Rowe J.’s reasons, at para. 69 (emphasis added)). Clearly, the “distinct [consumer] market” remains legally relevant under my colleague’s approach. My colleague also concludes that the reference judge made no error in holding there were no non‑infringing options because Nova did not establish a relevant non‑infringing option and even conceded that there were no such options (Rowe J.’s reasons, at para. 70). However, it is noteworthy that this concession was ultimately based on Nova’s understanding — shared by the reference judge and the Court of Appeal — that a non‑infringing option was required by law to be a true consumer substitute.

[192]                     Second, my colleague does not take into account the reference judge’s conclusion that the differential profit approach was legally unavailable. Citing Lovastatin, a damages case, the judge held that the non‑infringing option “must be a true substitute or real alternative” (para. 143). On my colleague’s own approach, therefore, the judge erred in law. This ought to answer any concerns about the legitimacy of this appeal in light of Nova’s concessions, a point upon which I expand below.

[193]                     Third, my colleague is equivocal and unclear about the legal requirements for a non‑infringing option. Whether such an option exists cannot be, as my colleague states, “a question of fact” (para. 67). There must be some legal requirements or standards that guide courts and the parties to the litigation. It is, and must be, a question of mixed fact and law. I do not deny that the determination of whether a non‑infringing option exists is a factually suffused task that, absent an error of law or an error in principle, is reviewable on a standard of palpable and overriding error (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at paras. 26‑29; Cinar Corporation v. Robinson, 2013 SCC 73, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1168, at para. 78). However, there must be some legal standards that guide the analysis and, in my view, this appeal requires our Court to set out those standards clearly. The approach I endorse regarding how courts are to determine whether a non‑infringing option exists involves consideration of what the infringer could have and would have done but for its infringement.

(b)         A True Consumer Substitute Requirement Distorts the Causation Analysis

[194]                     Limiting non‑infringing options to consumer substitutes (or at least maintaining that the consumer market for the patented product is relevant to determining whether a non‑infringing option exists) distorts the causation analysis. By focusing on the value of the patent in the abstract, the analysis ignores the value that the infringement brought to the infringer. The problem with focusing on the value of the patent in the abstract is that it needlessly disadvantages infringers that could have and would have produced a different product that would not have been a consumer substitute for the patented product. Conversely, it risks incentivizing efficient infringement by benefiting infringers that could not or would not otherwise have produced a consumer substitute for the patented product. I explain this below.

[195]                     A true consumer substitute requirement works to the disadvantage of an infringer that could have and would have produced a non‑infringing product that would have competed in a different consumer market. Without any principled justification, it prevents the application of the differential profit approach. This is a distortion of the causation analysis, as it forces an infringer to disgorge gains that are not causally attributable to its infringement.

[196]                     This distortion can be seen in the present case. The reference judge made specific findings about what Nova could have and would have done but for the infringement. Indeed, with respect to Nova’s PE2 plant where the infringing grades of polyethylene were produced, the judge found as a fact that “Nova could use the PE2 plant flexibly to replace all infringing products with [non‑infringing alternatives]” (para. 86 (emphasis added)). He also found that Nova “would have worked assiduously to fill out the PE2 plant with other products:” and that it “would have sold these other products within North America or to Asian markets” (para. 158 (emphasis added)). Nevertheless, the application of the damages case law, which required a true consumer substitute, prevented the use of the differential profit approach. This distorted the causation analysis by preventing a comparison between Nova’s actual profits and its hypothetical profits had it not infringed.

[197]                     In this case, my colleague’s approach forces Nova to disgorge millions of dollars in profits that have not been shown to be causally attributable to its infringement of Dow’s patent. As the dissenting judge in the Federal Court of Appeal noted, not all of Nova’s profits appear to be causally attributable to that infringement: “To put the issue in context, the total amount ordered to be paid to Dow was approximately $644 million, and according to NOVA the failure to apply an apportionment of profits resulted in inflating the award by more than $300 million” (para. 187). The differential profit approach should have been available, and its proper application would have ensured that Nova disgorged only the profits that were causally attributable to its infringement.

[198]                     While the consequences for Nova in this case are particularly inequitable and harsh, the approach my colleague has endorsed will have the opposite effect for other patent infringers. Indeed, a related causation problem arises with respect to an infringer that could not or would not have produced a non‑infringing option. The theoretical existence of an alternative product that services the same consumers as the patented product allows the infringer to retain profits derived from the breach of the patentee’s statutory monopoly. If anything, this creates the very form of “business insurance for infringers” discussed by my colleague (para. 62). So long as there is a non‑infringing option that is a true consumer substitute, then a would‑be infringer has an incentive to infringe. If caught, it will have to disgorge only the difference between its actual profits and the baseline profits that theoretically could have been earned. This is so even if these theoretical profits are not based on a reasonable hypothetical (i.e. a hypothetical that considers what the infringer could have and would have done but for the infringement). Such an approach to causation permits a would‑be infringer to “efficiently breach” a patentee’s statutory monopoly, thereby rewarding intentional and brazen infringements. This undermines the patent bargain.

[199]                     This distortion in the causation analysis is evident in Federal Court’s decision in Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Rivett, 2009 FC 317, [2010] 2 F.C.R. 93, rev’d in part 2010 FCA 207, [2012] 1 F.C.R. 473. In that case, Mr. Rivett infringed Monsanto’s patent — the same patent at issue in Schmeiser — by planting genetically modified soybean seeds. Mr. Rivett’s evidence was that he had “no choice but to plant the ROUNDUP READY soybean seed as there were no conventional soybeans available at the local co‑op or from the one local farmer whom he asked” (para. 60). The reference judge, whose decision was affirmed on this point on appeal, held that “the fact that conventional soybeans are a non‑infringing alternative to ROUNDUP READY soybeans is sufficient to permit the Court to use that crop as a comparator, whether or not such conventional seed was in fact available to the defendant in 2004” (para. 63). However, if an infringer could not or would not have used a non‑infringing option that would have competed in the same consumer market, why should it benefit from its theoretical existence? While I would not speculate on what the appropriate hypothetical should have been in Rivett, suffice it to say that the unavailability of conventional soybeans means that their use as a comparator was not a reasonable hypothetical.

[200]                     My colleague criticizes my approach, stating that it gives rise to “unacceptable consequences, one being that the quantum of profits to be disgorged would vary with the size of the infringing business and the breadth of its product lines” (para. 63). According to my colleague, this “benefits large corporations”, while “smaller businesses would be disproportionately disadvantaged” (paras. 63‑64). With respect, this is simply not the case. Indeed, it is my colleague’s approach that creates a windfall for Dow, a large corporation, in the case at hand.

[201]                     In any event, the size of the infringer is completely irrelevant. Nowhere in the Patent Act is it indicated that an accounting of profits must ensure that all infringers disgorge the same amount for their respective infringements of a patent. What my approach does is emphasize that, rather than focusing on the value of the patent in the abstract, the court should focus on the individual infringer and the benefits it derives from its infringement of the patent. This is entirely consistent with the gain‑based nature of the remedy. With respect, my colleague’s view about the effect on the remedy on small infringers and large infringers finds no support either in the Patent Act or in the conceptual underpinnings of the accounting of profits remedy. I could not say it better than Stratas J.A.: “. . . some judges start invoking ‘equity’ as a reason to award whatever seems, to them, appropriate and fair. Such an approach is antithetical to a legal system governed by the rule of law that prizes consistent and predictable rulings” (F.C.A. reasons, at para. 9). Although I disagree with Stratas J.A. on the disposition of this appeal, I agree with him on the necessity of applying rules impartially rather than on the basis of irrelevant considerations like the size of the companies involved in the litigation.

[202]                     Ultimately, I am of the view that a rigorous application of “but for” causation is critical to the proper application of the differential profit approach. With respect, my colleague’s approach distorts the causation analysis. By doing so, it both under‑deters and over‑deters. It under‑deters to the extent that it permits an efficient infringement. It over‑deters to the extent that, when there is no consumer substitute for the patented product, it fails to isolate the value attributable to the infringement and instead assumes that all profits are attributable to it.

(2)         How Are Courts to Determine the Reasonable Hypothetical to Be Used in an Accounting of Profits?

[203]                     In my view, the reasonable hypothetical to be used in an accounting of profits must be based on what an infringer could have and would have done but for the infringement. An examination of what the infringer could have done involves an objective assessment of what was feasible in the circumstances, while an examination of what the infringer would have done involves a more subjective assessment of its alternative course of conduct. However, as I will explain, this subjective assessment is tempered and influenced by the infringer’s conduct in the real world.

[204]                     I am not suggesting that there was any discussion in Schmeiser of what the infringer could have done. I readily acknowledge that the Court never referred to what Mr. Schmeiser could have done but for his infringement of the patent. However, the Court did create a general framework that compared actual profits with hypothetical profits, without comprehensively detailing how hypothetical profits were to be determined.

[205]                     In my view, an infringer’s hypothetical profits are most easily and accurately determined by examining what the infringer could have and would have done but for the infringement. The case law subsequent to Schmeiser — both from this Court and from the Federal Court of Appeal — has affirmed this approach. For example, in Cinar, this Court clarified that the “‘differential profit’ approach . . . is generally used in cases where an infringement allows the infringer to commercialize a good in a more profitable manner than he could have without the infringement” (para. 80 (emphasis added)). Since Schmeiser and Cinar, the case law relating to how courts should construct the hypothetical world has continued to evolve. Courts should examine what an infringer could have done and what it would have done. This is not inconsistent with Schmeiser; it is simply a development and refinement of the law that has occurred since that case which I would endorse rather than reject, which I believe my colleague does. The “could have” and “would have” branches of the analysis help courts to create a reasonable hypothetical world in which the infringement did not occur.

(a)           “Could Have” and “Would Have” Branches of the Analysis

[206]                     Since Schmeiser, the Federal Court of Appeal has developed a robust jurisprudence on the construction of reasonable hypotheticals. This jurisprudence clarifies the evidence that is relevant to establishing what the infringer could have and would have done (see, e.g., Lovastatin, at paras. 73‑95; Pfizer (2016), at paras. 47‑52; Cefaclor, at paras. 31‑43; ADIR (2020), at paras. 53‑55 and 90‑127). The “could have” and “would have” branches have been considered both when assessing damages (e.g., Lovastatin) and in the accounting of profits context (e.g., ADIR (2020)).

[207]                     In my view, the case law on how courts are to construct the hypothetical world is relevant and applicable in the accounting of profits context. The only caveat is that the hypothetical world is not limited to true consumer substitutes, as it is in the damages context. To be clear, in an accounting of profits case, the infringer’s best non‑infringing option can be, and likely often will be, a consumer substitute for the patented product. However, being a true consumer substitute is not an essential requirement and is not even legally relevant. The focus should be on what the infringer could have and would have done but for the infringement.

[208]                     The damages case law on constructing the hypothetical world is therefore informative. For example, as the Federal Court of Appeal noted in Lovastatin, at para. 90:

•                        The real world informs our construction of the “but for” world.

 

•                        Conduct in the real world is “very important” to what would have happened in the “but for” world.

 

•                        Findings of fact from the liability decision are relevant to constructing the “but for” world.

 

•                        “Brazen” infringement in the real world makes it very difficult to prove that the defendant would have deployed the non‑infringing alternative in the “but for” world.

[209]                     The real world informs both the “could have” and the “would have” branches of the hypothetical analysis. If the infringer’s best non‑infringing option was not available as an option in the real world, then the infringer could not have pursued that option in the hypothetical world. Similarly, if the infringer brazenly infringed the patent, then this too informs what it would have done in the hypothetical world. If the infringer knowingly had the option of complying with the law but brazenly chose not to do so, it cannot then seek to benefit from the hypothetical profits it could have earned had it obeyed the law — this is not a reasonable hypothetical.

[210]                     I understand brazen infringement to be an intentional infringement committed for the purpose of surreptitiously securing a benefit from the patent. I would not consider an infringement to be brazen simply because the infringer intentionally produced or used a product that it honestly and reasonably believed was not covered by the patent. This could be because (1) the infringer reasonably and genuinely believed the patent was invalid; (2) the infringer was an innocent infringer; or (3) the infringer, while perhaps not innocent, did not intentionally attempt to reap the benefits of the patent surreptitiously.

[211]                     This is consistent with Schmeiser. Mr. Schmeiser could not be classified as an innocent infringer, since he had actively cultivated seeds containing Monsanto’s patented invention. However, while he was not necessarily innocent, there was no finding that he had intentionally infringed the patent, as this was held to be irrelevant to liability (see Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser, 2001 FCT 256, 12 C.P.R. (4th) 204, at para. 115). As well, and importantly, Mr. Schmeiser had not sprayed Roundup after the crop commenced growing.

(b)         Persuasive Burden

[212]                     In an accounting of profits case, the burden of establishing what the infringer could have and would have done logically lies on the infringer itself (ADIR (2020), at para. 51), although both sides can adduce evidence on this point.

[213]                     To the extent that the infringer makes an implausible argument about what it could have and would have done, it risks not satisfying its burden. The infringer does this at its own peril. If the infringer cannot establish its “best non‑infringing option” on a balance of probabilities, then the differential profit approach cannot be used. In these circumstances, the court may properly conclude (after determining that no further apportionment is necessary) that it is appropriate to apply either the full costs approach or the differential costs approach. This is entirely consistent with the notion that the differential profit approach is the “preferred means of calculating an accounting of profits” (Schmeiser, at para. 102). It also addresses my colleague’s concern about “business insurance”.

(3)         Availability of the Differential Profit Approach in the Present Case

[214]                     Dow raises a procedural argument regarding why Nova should be denied the relief it now seeks. Dow argues that, at trial, Nova abandoned its argument that it could have sold non‑infringing products as substitutes for its infringing product, SURPASS. According to Dow, “Nova cannot, on appeal, walk back unequivocal concessions it made at trial and that the trial judge relied on in rendering his decision” (R.F., at para. 9).

[215]                     I disagree with Dow’s characterization of Nova’s concession. That concession needs to be contextualized in light of the post‑Schmeiser case law. The damages case law and accounting of profits case law dealing with non‑infringing options or alternatives became intertwined in the Federal Courts after Schmeiser. Nova — like the reference judge and the Federal Court of Appeal — understood the damages case law on non‑infringing alternatives to be relevant and binding. Lovastatin had been incorporated into the accounting of profits cases, and its requirement that a non‑infringing alternative be a true consumer substitute was viewed as a requirement for the application of the differential profit approach. Indeed, the reference judge held that the differential profit approach requires a comparison with a non‑infringing alternative, which “must be a true substitute or real alternative” (para. 143).

[216]                     Based on this understanding of the law, Nova abandoned its argument about hypothetical profits, believing that the differential profit approach was unavailable. Instead, it suggested that its hypothetical costs could be deducted. On appeal in the Federal Court of Appeal, Nova “cast its apportionment arguments differently” (para. 84). In this Court, Nova once again recast its arguments, asserting that the differential profit approach should have applied.

[217]                     I agree with the Federal Court of Appeal that, although Nova may have recast its legal arguments, it has not “rais[ed] any new legal issu[e]” but rather has “offer[ed] different legal arguments on that same issue” (para. 86). The primary issue, although characterized differently, has always been one of apportionment and causation: to what extent were all of Nova’s profits causally attributable to its infringement of Dow’s patent?

[218]                     Given my conclusion that a non‑infringing alternative does not need to be a true consumer substitute for the purposes of the differential profit approach, Nova’s concession that there were no consumer substitutes is not determinative of the outcome. With respect, the reference judge erred in law by holding that a non‑infringing option needed to be a true consumer substitute for the patented product.

[219]                     Additionally, the differential profit approach is preferred, at least in part, because of the way in which it subsumes any apportionment analysis. Apportionment is simply the manner by which a court separates the profits made as a result of the infringement from those made as a result of something else. The court looks at the different profit drivers and apportions profits based on whether or not they are causally attributable to the infringement. Even though Nova conceded in the courts below that the differential profit approach could not apply, I see no reason why apportionment would have been inappropriate. The differential profit approach is simply a particularly effective and precise form of apportionment analysis. Accordingly, even if that approach could not be applied based on Nova’s concession, the courts below erred by not excluding the profits not causally attributable to its infringement of Dow’s patent.

[220]                     On the record available, this Court cannot determine how to apply the differential profit approach to the facts. Therefore, I would remit the matter to the Federal Court.

C.            Springboard Profits Are Available

[221]                     As I said above, springboard profits are an infringer’s post-patent expiry profits that result from the infringement of the patentee’s statutory monopoly during the life of the patent. By infringing the patentee’s statutory monopoly, the infringer is able to build sales and market share that increase its profits after the expiry of the patent.

[222]                     Nova asserts that springboard profits are not available because a “patent provides a time‑limited monopoly over the patented product” (A.F., at para. 124). Nova argues that “an accounting must end when the patent expires” and that, therefore, there is no basis for a post‑expiry award of springboard profits (A.F., at para. 125).

[223]                     I would reject this argument. Although the patent provided Dow with a monopoly only for a limited period, Dow should be entitled to an accounting of all profits that Nova earned as a result of its infringement. It is of no moment that certain profits causally attributable to Nova’s infringement did not accrue to it until after the patent expired. So long as the profits were causally attributable to its infringement, they remain subject to disgorgement.

[224]                     That said, as I discussed above, the causation analysis for any post‑expiry period must be based on the same hypothetical “but for” reasoning embodied in the differential profit approach.

[225]                     It follows that I do not agree that the springboard profits were properly calculated in this case. The case should be remitted to the Federal Court to determine the post‑patent expiry profits that Nova could have and would have made but for the infringement. These profits should then be compared with Nova’s actual post‑expiry profits.

V.           Disposition

[226]                     For these reasons, I would allow the appeal. I would remit the matter to the Federal Court for determination. The differential profit approach should be available in this case.

[227]                     With respect to costs, Nova is entitled to its costs in this Court and in the Federal Court of Appeal.

                  Karakatsanis J. —

I.               Overview

[1]                             Some of the most pernicious crimes are the hardest to investigate. To draw those crimes into the open, the police, acting undercover, sometimes create occasions for people to commit the very crimes they seek to prevent. Done properly, such techniques may cast new light on covert offending, unveiling harms that would otherwise go unpunished. But taken too far, they may tempt the vulnerable or the morally wavering into criminality, and virtue-test many others, threatening privacy and the public’s confidence in the justice system. They demand caution.

[2]                             The stakes are highest on the Internet. While the medium has made activities more efficient, widespread, and harder to track, it has also allowed state surveillance to become, potentially, ever more expansive. The dilemmas this creates for balancing law enforcement with civil liberties, the rule of law, and the repute of the justice system are ongoing. This appeal, and its companion appeals, raise one of them.

[3]                             Between 2014 and 2017, “Project Raphael”, an online investigation of the York Regional Police (YRP), led to the arrests of 104 men for child luring and related offences. Ads posted by the police on the escort subdirectory of Backpage.com spurred text-message conversations, where an undercover officer, after agreeing to provide sexual services, revealed themselves to be a juvenile. All those who took up the invitation to visit the designated hotel room were arrested. Among them was the appellant in this case, Mr. Ramelson, as well as the three appellants in the related appeals (Mr. Jaffer (R. v. Jaffer, 2022 SCC 45), Mr. Haniffa (R. v. Haniffa, 2022 SCC 46), and Mr. Dare (R. v. Dare, 2022 SCC 47)). They argue they were entrapped.

[4]                             When the police lack reasonable suspicion that the individual is already engaged in criminal activity, the entrapment doctrine forbids them from offering opportunities to commit offences unless they do so in the course of a “bona fide inquiry”: that is, where they (1) reasonably suspect that crime is occurring in a sufficiently precise space; and (2) have a genuine purpose of investigating and repressing crime (R. v. Ahmad, 2020 SCC 11, at para. 20). That test applies to investigations in physical and virtual spaces alike. But as this Court noted in Ahmad, “state surveillance over virtual spaces is of an entirely different qualitative order than surveillance over a public space” (para. 37). There, the Court considered those differences in the context of surveillance that transpired in the investigative “space” of a phone number. This appeal, and the three related appeals, require us to do the same in the context of the Internet.

[5]                             At its core, the entrapment doctrine recognizes that sometimes “the ends do not justify the means” (R. v. Mack, 1988 CanLII 24 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, at p. 938). Given the Internet’s potential reach, there is a strong public interest in ensuring that online police investigations do not unduly intrude on public life. In assessing whether an online space is sufficiently precise to ground the police’s reasonable suspicion, then, the Internet’s unique features must be considered. Being informational rather than geographical, online spaces flout the limitations of physical spaces; they may lead people to behave differently than they do in person; and their use can raise distinct rights concerns, notably over privacy. Unlike physical spaces, an online space’s parameters may say little about whether the space of an investigation was sufficiently precise. Instead, the space must be viewed with particular attention to its functions and interactivity to ensure that the space has been “carefully delineate[d] and tightly circumscribe[d]” (Ahmad, at para. 39). The factors discussed by this Court in Ahmad — in particular, the number of activities and people affected, the interests of privacy and free expression, and the availability of less intrusive investigative techniques — may assist in that assessment. They may be key to ensuring that the purview of an online police investigation was no “broader than the evidence allow[ed]” (para. 41).

[6]                             Applied here, I agree with the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the application judge erred by failing to consider factors beyond the number of people affected by the police investigation. On the correct analysis, the police had reasonable suspicion over a sufficiently precise space and the offences the police offered were rationally connected and proportionate to the offence they reasonably suspected was occurring. Mr. Ramelson was therefore not entrapped. I would dismiss the appeal.

II.            Facts

A.           Project Raphael

[7]                              Like much else, the market for juvenile sex work migrated to the Internet over the past decade. Recognizing a need to adapt their techniques, the YRP became a Canadian leader in efforts to address the issue proactively — by searching for crimes, rather than waiting for them to be reported. Whether those efforts went too far, and crossed from legitimate investigation into entrapment, is the question in this case.

[8]                              Inspector Thai Truong joined the YRP as an officer in 2002, and joined its drugs and vice enforcement unit soon thereafter. From 2008 onward, he investigated the commercial sexual exploitation of young girls and women. That assignment coincided with a shift in the YRP’s approach. With little experience investigating juvenile sex work offences before 2008 — despite the many anecdotal signs that they were occurring — the police realized, in Insp. Truong’s words, “that unless you really look for it, you’re not going to find it” (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 24-25). They began educating themselves on the problem, surveying its prevalence, and, eventually, designing investigations that were adapted to its clandestine nature.

[9]                              Juvenile sex work found many homes on the Internet, and lacking the means to pursue all of them, the YRP’s focus eventually settled on the escort subdirectory of Backpage. As a forum dedicated to the sexual services market, with hundreds of ads per night in the Greater Toronto Area alone, the volume of illegal activity on the platform was immense. And much of it was apparently underage, a reality reinforced for Insp. Truong at every turn, from professional conferences; contacts with community groups and non-governmental organizations; and the dozens of investigations into juvenile sex work — including interviews with hundreds of sex workers — that he assisted in over his career.

[10]                          Proactive investigations into sex work can target either the “seller side” or the “buyer side” of the market. In December 2013, the YRP launched a seller-side vice probe that, in the 2 weeks it was live, identified 31 sex workers in the York Region subpage on Backpage who appeared to be juveniles, 9 of whom were in fact underage. It also found that those who came in contact with the investigation first started selling sex, on average, at 14.8 years old.

[11]                          While insightful, such investigations were, to Insp. Truong’s mind, only a partial success. Because selling sex is not itself illegal, the police depended upon sex worker cooperation. But whether fearing their pimps, anxious for their livelihoods, lacking a home to return to, or refusing to see themselves as victims, sex workers were often reluctant to assist. Locating the juveniles had done little to abate the juvenile sex work market. So, changing course, Insp. Truong devised a buyer-side investigation called “Project Raphael”, which the YRP launched in 2014.

[12]                          With few models to go on, Insp. Truong was inspired by an investigation in British Columbia, where undercover police, posing as juveniles, placed ads on Craigslist offering sex workers aged 18, with descriptors suggesting youth. Project Raphael placed similar ads on Backpage, listing the age as 18 (the minimum the website would permit) and using words like “tight”, “young”, “new” or “fresh” in the ad’s text, emulating common Backpage advertisements for the youngest sex workers (2019 ONSC 6894 (first ruling on entrapment), at para. 11 (CanLII); A.R., vol. II, at p. 135). When potential clients responded, the police, imitating an adolescent’s idiom, arranged a sexual transaction. When the client agreed, the police revealed the sex worker was underage. When the client continued to engage, the police invited them to a hotel room. And when the client opened the door, the police arrested them.

[13]                          The police were aware that this design would capture more than just the most determined sexual predators. As Insp. Truong explained, those who clicked on the police’s ads could be divided into three groups: (1) those “who were looking strictly for adult females”; (2) those who “were not specifically looking but were open to engaging in sex with underage females when the opportunity presented itself”; and (3) those “who contacted the ad specifically looking to have sex with an underage female” (first ruling on entrapment, at para. 14). The project’s focus was on the second and third groups. But the only way to tell which category a buyer fell into, on Insp. Truong’s account, was to communicate with them. And the project never attempted to track or categorize the responses.

[14]                          The investigation occurred in four phases, whose form evolved over time. The first phase, in 2014, listed an email address with the number “16” as a further clue to the poster’s age, but the flood of responses so deluged the officers that they restricted communications to text thereafter. For similar reasons, the police eventually lowered the disclosed age from 16 to 14, to concentrate resources on the most serious offences. Intentionally or not, this had the effect of exposing those caught to more serious charges for luring minors under 16.

[15]                          Although never recorded, the number of responses was “overwhelming”. And the number of arrests was significant. In 2014-15, posing most often as a 16-year-old, the police made a total of 32 arrests in 8 days online. In 2016, with the age lowered to 15, the police made 53 arrests in 8 days. And in 2017, with the age further lowered to 14, the police made 19 arrests in 4 days. In total, Project Raphael led to the arrest of 104 people, all in only 20 days of operation.

B.            Corey Daniel Ramelson

[16]                          Mr. Ramelson was among those arrested in 2017. On March 27, he messaged “Michelle”, aged 18, who was described as a “Tight Brand NEW girl . . . who is sexy and YOUNG with a tight body”, with a “YOUNG FRIEND if your [sic] interested too” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 130). The ad featured three faceless photographs of an undercover officer in her 30s, wearing a t-shirt from a local high school. After 27 minutes of somewhat sporadic conversation, and having agreed to a transaction, the undercover officer (UC) revealed their “true” ages:

[16:28 – UC]: Just so you know we under 18. Some guys freak out and I don’t want problems. We are small and it’s obvious.

 

[16:29 – Ramelson]: I’m cool with it. I’ll be gentle as long as you’re sexy and willing

. . .

 

[16:31 – UC]: We are both willing. We’re 14 but will both be turning 15 this year. That cool? We are buddies and very flexable [sic]??

 

[16:32 – Ramelson]: Should be lots of fun

 

[16:32 – Ramelson]: Are those read [sic] photos from the ads. Those girls look a bit older

 

[16:36 – UC]: They are both us.

 

[16:37 – Ramelson]: Ok. I’m going to leave now

 

(A.R., vol. I, at pp. 133-34; see also first ruling on entrapment, at para. 20.)

[17]                          Arriving at the hotel room two hours later, Mr. Ramelson was arrested. He was charged with three offences:

•         Telecommunicating with a person he believed was under the age of 16 years for the purpose of facilitating the commission of an offence under s. 152 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (invitation to sexual touching) contrary to s. 172.1(1)(b) (child luring under 16);

•         Communicating for the purpose of obtaining for consideration the sexual services of a person under the age of 18 years, contrary to s. 286.1(2) (communicating to obtain sexual services from a minor); and

•         Telecommunicating to make an arrangement with a person to commit an offence under s. 152 (invitation to sexual touching) contrary to s. 172.2(1)(b) (arrangement to commit sexual offences against a person under 16).

[18]                          He was tried and convicted of all three offences in 2019 (2019 ONSC 4061). He then applied to stay proceedings on the basis of entrapment.

III.         Judicial Decisions

A.           Rulings on Entrapment Application, Ontario Superior Court of Justice (de Sa J.)

[19]                          Justice de Sa initially dismissed Mr. Ramelson’s entrapment application in November 2019. While the police lacked reasonable suspicion over Mr. Ramelson specifically, they “had a reasonable basis to believe that individuals” — whether actively seeking juveniles or not — were “routinely involved in the purchase of sexual services from juvenile prostitutes on Backpage.com” (first ruling on entrapment, at paras. 51-52). Project Raphael was thus a bona fide inquiry. He rejected Mr. Ramelson’s further argument that he had been induced.

[20]                          This Court then released its decision in Ahmad, where it considered how the principles of bona fide inquiries apply in virtual spaces. The judge invited the parties to make further submissions. And in separate reasons, issued in October 2020, he revised his conclusion: Mr. Ramelson had been entrapped.

[21]                        Backpage, he now concluded, was too broad a space to support reasonable suspicion. The website was not “dedicated to underage prostitution” — indeed, the “overwhelming majority” of the activity in even its escort subsection did not involve juveniles (2020 ONSC 5030, 67 C.R. (7th) 96 (second ruling on entrapment), at para. 24). Given the age listed, and the photos in the ad, “there would be no reasonable basis to infer the caller contacting the ad would be looking for an underage girl” (para. 27 (emphasis in original)). Nor did any such inference arise from the texts, and the “bait and switch” of announcing the age late in the conversation raised “clear entrapment concerns” (para. 29). Since the language in the ads was “known by police to draw in a much broader pool of individuals than simply individuals looking for ‘underage’ girls” (para. 31), the officer should have done more to confirm that Mr. Ramelson was himself looking for one before inviting him to commit crimes. Lacking reasonable suspicion over the space, or over Mr. Ramelson personally, the police’s offer amounted to entrapment.  

B.            Court of Appeal for Ontario, 2021 ONCA 328, 155 O.R. (3d) 481 (Juriansz, Tulloch and Paciocco JJ.A.)

[22]                          The Crown’s appeal from the application judge’s decision to stay Mr. Ramelson’s conviction was heard together with three defence appeals from conviction (involving the appellants in the companion appeals before this Court in Jaffer, Haniffa and Dare). Concluding that the application judge in Mr. Ramelson’s case had erred in finding Project Raphael was not a bona fide inquiry, the Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal and set aside the application judge’s order. In three separate decisions, the court also dismissed the related defence appeals.

[23]                        In Mr. Ramelson’s matter, Juriansz J.A. explained that it was open to the application judge to find that the police had reasonable suspicion that the criminal activity under investigation was taking place on the escort section of Backpage (the offences under ss. 286.1(2) and 172.1(1)(b)). First, while the YRP lacked detailed statistics, Insp. Truong, who had extensive experience with the offences, gave sufficient evidence to show police had a reasonable suspicion that customers were going onto Backpage to obtain sexual services from persons they knew or believed to be under 18 contrary to s. 286.1(2).

[24]                          And while the same could not be said for the child luring offence in s. 172.1(1)(b), which concerned a person believed to be 16 rather than 18, that offence was nonetheless rationally connected and proportionate to the s. 286.1(2) offence. Given their shared elements, including the use of telecommunication, the police, in posing as a juvenile, would inevitably offer an opportunity to commit a child luring offence under s. 172.1(1) when offering an opportunity to commit the s. 286.1(2) offence. Since the police had reason to believe that juvenile sex workers, on average, first started selling sex under the age of 15, the offences of child luring under 16 (s. 172.1(1)(b)) and child luring under 18 (s. 172.1(1)(a)) were both rationally connected to the s. 286.1(2) offence. And child luring under 16 is not “much more serious”, nor “totally unrelated” to the s. 286.1(2) offence (para. 89). 

[25]                        However, the application judge erred in assessing whether the virtual space was sufficiently precisely defined. In particular, he failed to consider other relevant factors beyond the number of people affected by the investigation: including, the “number and nature of activities affected, the nature and level of the privacy interest affected, and the importance of the virtual space to freedom of expression” (para. 97). Reviewing the relevant Ahmad factors anew, the court concluded that Project Raphael was a bona fide inquiry and Mr. Ramelson had not been entrapped.

IV.         Issues

[26]                          The case raises two broad issues:

•         How does the bona fide inquiry prong of the entrapment doctrine apply in the context of online police investigations?

•         Did the application judge err in concluding that Mr. Ramelson was entrapped?

(i)      Did the police have reasonable suspicion that the s. 286.1(2) offence was occurring in a space defined with sufficient precision?

(ii)   If so, were the police entitled to offer the opportunity to commit child luring offences under ss. 172.1 and 172.2 of the Criminal Code?

[27]                        My reasons proceed as follows. First, I review the law of entrapment and consider how the bona fide inquiry prong accounts for the unique features of online spaces. Those features — in particular, that the Internet’s boundaries are informational rather than geographical; that people behave differently online than they do in person; and that Internet use raises distinct rights concerns — call for greater attention to the functions and interactivity of online spaces when assessing whether that space was sufficiently precise to ground reasonable suspicion.

[28]                        Second, I apply that framework to this case and conclude, like the Court of Appeal, that the application judge erred in failing to consider circumstances beyond the number of people affected by the investigation. On a proper analysis, the police had reasonable suspicion that the criminal activity in question was occurring in a sufficiently precise space and the child luring offences were rationally connected and proportionate to the s. 286.1(2) offence. Project Raphael was thus a bona fide inquiry and Mr. Ramelson was not entrapped.

V.           Legal Framework

A.           The Entrapment Doctrine

[29]                          Whatever their utility in fighting crime, some police techniques are “unacceptable in a free society with strong notions of fairness, decency, and privacy” (Ahmad, at para. 16). Entrapment is one of them. It is not a traditional defence, but a form of abuse of process whose only remedy is a stay of proceedings. It may occur in two ways:

(a) the authorities provide a person with an opportunity to commit an offence without acting on a reasonable suspicion that this person is already engaged in criminal activity or pursuant to a bona fide inquiry;

 

(b) although having such a reasonable suspicion or acting in the course of a bona fide inquiry, they go beyond providing an opportunity and induce the commission of an offence.

 

(Mack, at pp. 964-65)

[30]                          As a form of abuse of process, the entrapment doctrine flows from courts’ inherent jurisdiction to protect the justice system’s integrity, a power necessary to preserve “the respect and support of the community”, upon which the rule of law depends (R. v. Conway, 1989 CanLII 66 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1659, at p. 1667; see Mack, at p. 938). Like abuse of process, the entrapment doctrine censures state conduct that “violates our notions of ‘fair play’ and ‘decency’ and which shows blatant disregard for the qualities of humanness which all of us share” (Mack, at p. 940).

[31]                          Entrapment recognizes that “police involvement in the commission of a crime can bring the administration of justice into disrepute” (Ahmad, at para. 16). When the police offer opportunities to commit crimes without reasonable suspicion, or induce their commission, they may transgress several expectations: that the police will not intrude on privacy; that they will not randomly test the public’s propensity to commit crimes, and still less manufacture them; that they, of all actors, will not act unlawfully for the purpose of entrapping others; and that they will not squander public resources on any of the above (Mack, at p. 958). Violating those expectations reflects poorly on law enforcement, but it may also diminish confidence in the justice system more generally.

[32]                          The remedy for entrapment is a stay of proceedings — the “most drastic remedy a criminal court can order” (R. v. Babos, 2014 SCC 16, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 309, at para. 30) — not because the accused is entitled to an acquittal, but because the Crown “is disentitled to a conviction” (R. v. Jewitt, 1985 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 128, at p. 148; Mack, at p. 944). A stay of proceedings ends prosecutions that infringe basic norms, marking courts’ refusal to “condone or be seen to lend a stamp of approval to behaviour which transcends what our society perceives to be acceptable on the part of the state” (Mack, at p. 942).

[33]                          Yet law enforcement also serves an important public interest. The police must innovate if they are to match offenders’ ingenuity. Some offences, too, are hard to investigate: whether because they are “consensual”; because they “victimize those who are reluctant or unable to report them”; or because they may “lead to such great harm that they must be actively prevented” (Ahmad, at para. 18). And so drastic a remedy as a stay of proceedings calls for some restraint. These realities entitle the police to “considerable latitude” in their investigations (Mack, at p. 917), such that a finding of entrapment should issue only in the “clearest of cases” (p. 976).

[34]                          The doctrine thus strives to balance competing imperatives: “The rule of law, and the need to protect privacy interests and personal freedom from state overreach . . .” on the one hand, and “the state’s legitimate interest in investigating and prosecuting crime” on the other (Ahmad, at para. 22; see Mack, at pp. 941-42). Below, I consider what that balance requires in the context of police investigations into online spaces.

B.            Bona Fide Inquiries and the Internet

(1)         Overview

[35]                        The central issue on appeal is whether Project Raphael was a bona fide inquiry. This has two criteria: the police must have had (1) reasonable suspicion over a sufficiently precise space; and (2) a genuine purpose of investigating and repressing crime (Ahmad, at para. 20). Satisfying those criteria entitles the police to present “any person associated with the area with the opportunity to commit the particular offence” — even without individualized suspicion in the person investigated (R. v. Barnes, 1991 CanLII 84 (SCC), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 449, at p. 463 (emphasis in original)).

[36]                          Bona fide inquiries serve a useful purpose. In some cases, without knowing who might offend, the police may reasonably suspect that certain criminal activity is occurring within a given space. And, depending on the crime investigated, proactive methods may be necessary. The bona fide inquiry prong recognizes the legitimacy of such investigations, even as it seeks to confine them within careful limits.  

[37]                        The Court has twice applied this prong of the entrapment doctrine. In Barnes, the police suspected that considerable drug trafficking was occurring in a six-block area of Vancouver’s Granville Mall. The Court held that since the police’s suspicions were reasonable, they were entitled, acting in good faith, to approach anybody associated with the space with an offer to purchase drugs. In Ahmad, the Court considered two separate appeals in which police suspected that two phone numbers were being used for dial-a-dope operations. But since their suspicion was based on anonymous, unverified and uncorroborated tips, the Court held that the police did not have reasonable suspicion of illegal activity for the phone number itself, and so were not acting under a bona fide inquiry.

[38]                          Barnes loomed large in the courts below. For the Court of Appeal, it was the “archetypical example” of a bona fide inquiry (para. 23), showing that such investigations can potentially target thousands of people (para. 79). And for the application judge in Jaffer, a companion case, “an analogy c[ould] readily be drawn”, in the Internet context, “to the investigation of a geographical area in which specific crimes are known to be occurring to police” (A.R., Jaffer, vol. I, at p. 26).

[39]                        Yet the analogy calls for scrutiny. Physical spaces and actions are inherently limited in ways that virtual spaces and actions are not. The police in Barnes could have interacted with only so many people, approaching them one-by-one. And a physical space confines; it encloses people and things, and exhibits cycles of bustle and calm. Virtual spaces may escape those limits, inviting multitudes at all hours and distances, thus defying the boundaries we take for granted in the physical world. This explains why the Internet “provides fertile ground for sowing the seeds of unlawful conduct on a borderless scale” (R. v. Hamilton, 2005 SCC 47, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 432, at para. 30). And it explains why online police investigations may bear far-reaching implications for state surveillance, civil liberties and the rule of law.  

[40]                          The space of the police investigation in Ahmad — a phone number — was inherently limited: functionally, it only allowed the police to contact the person who could answer the phone. Yet the Court foresaw that privacy would be a major concern in virtual investigations more generally. The “breadth of some virtual places . . ., the ease of remote access to a potentially large number of targets that technology provides law enforcement, and the increasing prominence of technology as a means by which individuals conduct their personal lives”, it wrote, made state surveillance over virtual spaces qualitatively different than surveillance in public spaces (paras. 36-37). The nature of those differences falls to be further considered here, in the context of the Internet.  

[41]                          This appeal, then, requires the Court to apply Ahmad, to further address how virtual and physical spaces differ, and to consider what those differences imply for the law. I look first at online spaces before considering the bona fide inquiry prong in more detail.

(2)         Online Spaces

[42]                          Like any evolving technology, even an expansive definition of the Internet risks a quick obsolescence. And over time, the Internet has proven to be many things: social and anti-social, informative and mis-informative, and marked by clusters of hyperactivity and landscapes of inactivity. Still, some general features can be identified.

[43]                          While sustained by a vast physical infrastructure, the Internet, at least as most users experience it, is first and foremost a network of information and a means of connecting with others. That information is stored on servers but is accessible from an increasing array of devices in many physical locations. To say that individuals gather in online “spaces” means only that people have accessed shared information, wherever they happen to be geographically — which, today, may be from nearly anywhere. 

[44]                          Freed of geographical constraints, online spaces permit unique experiences. They are permeable, allowing users to seamlessly traverse from one space to another. They are often interactive, facilitating that movement and encouraging users to express themselves and engage with content. They can also be coded to enable varying levels of supervision, regulation or control. The Internet can be manipulated in ways that physical spaces cannot.

[45]                          And its information comes in all types. Functionally, the Internet encompasses the most public and the most private human behaviour. It is the largest megaphone or billboard ever conceived, allowing publishers to connect with audiences far vaster than could ever physically congregate. Yet many millions also conduct private activities online, confident that their information — whether touching their work, social or personal lives — will remain as secure from general circulation as if they had transacted in person. 

[46]                          With that range of behaviour comes a range of candour. Some online locations, like search engines, allow people to explore notions that they would be loath to air in public; others, like some forms of social media, allow users to dissimulate behind veneers of their choosing. Still others, like those dedicated to sexual activity, may encompass both poles. Online behaviour, in other words, may be radically transparent, radically disingenuous, or both. People do not always act online as they do in person.

[47]                        This, combined with its ubiquity, helps explain why the Internet raises “a host of new and challenging questions about privacy” (R. v. Spencer, 2014 SCC 43, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 212, at para. 1). Virtual police investigations may produce vast amounts of highly personal information, in contexts where people may be unusually uninhibited, engaged in forms of self-discovery, or seeking anonymity. The mere threat of state intrusion into those spaces may promote self-censorship, or the abstention from those spaces altogether, with costs to free expression and the exchange of ideas so essential in a vibrant democracy.

[48]                          Nor do privacy concerns end with online interactions. The Internet collects traces — information about a user’s physical location, online activity, and more — in ways that in-person interactions typically do not (Spencer, at para. 46). This data collection often occurs without a user’s awareness or consent, and those traces may persist indefinitely. They can spread with prodigious speed and reach, making it still more likely those traces will persist. And they can be compiled, dissected and analyzed to lend new insights into who we are as individuals or populations. As the rights and autonomy implications of those insights have become clearer, the divisions over how data is collected, protected and mobilized have in turn sharpened.  

[49]                        Online spaces, in short, differ from physical spaces in at least three ways: the Internet, being informational rather than geographical, sheds many of the physical world’s limitations in terms of scale and functions; people behave differently when online; and virtual spaces raise unique rights concerns. As Ahmad stated, online spaces are qualitatively different.

[50]                          In my view, the greatest consequence of these differences for bona fide inquiries is that the boundaries of an online “space” only tell part of the story. While intuitive, geographical analogies are imperfect. There is no simple way to compare a six-block area of a city to its online equivalent, except perhaps via those spaces’ functions. And even then, similar functions may conceal deeper differences in experience. In an era when a single Tweet may attract more traffic than an entire mall, the parameters of a virtual space may be a poor proxy for the scope of a police investigation.

[51]                          To respect the entrapment doctrine’s underlying balance of first principles, then, courts assessing whether an online police investigation was bona fide must pay close attention to the space’s functions and interactivity — that is, to the permeability, interconnectedness, dynamism and other features that make the Internet a distinctive milieu for law enforcement. Even tailored online investigations may represent a broad and profound invasion into peoples’ lives. Given the potential of online investigations to impact many more individuals than an equivalent investigation in a physical space, the nature of those impacts deserve scrutiny. How the police act on the Internet may matter as much or more as where they act.

(3)         Bona Fide Inquiries and Reasonable Suspicion

[52]                          The question becomes how the test for bona fide inquiries applies in the context of virtual spaces; a question this Court first addressed in Ahmad. As noted, bona fide inquiries must satisfy two criteria before the police may offer an opportunity to commit an offence: the police must have (1) a reasonable suspicion over a sufficiently precise space; and (2) a genuine purpose of investigating and repressing crime (Ahmad, at para. 20). The second criterion was not raised as an issue in this case. The issue, instead, is whether the police had reasonable suspicion over a sufficiently precise space.

[53]                        Reasonable suspicion is itself a familiar standard, applicable in other contexts (Ahmad, at para. 30). It is not onerous; it requires only the reasonable possibility, not probability, that crime is occurring (R. v. Chehil, 2013 SCC 49, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 220, at para. 27). Yet it still subjects police actions to “exacting curial scrutiny”, to ensure they were founded on objective evidence rather than on profiling, stereotyping or other improper grounds (Ahmad, at paras. 24-25). As an objective standard, it “protects everyone from random testing”, whether they are tempted to commit crimes in the space or not (para. 27 (emphasis in original)).

[54]                          In its application, reasonable suspicion requires “a constellation of objectively discernible facts assessed against the totality of the circumstances” (R. v. Stairs, 2022 SCC 11, at para. 68). It is “fact-based, flexible, and grounded in common sense and practical, everyday experience” (Chehil, at para. 29). It eschews generalities; the suspicion must be “sufficiently particularized” (para. 30). And while it may be informed by an officer’s training and experience, it must be concretely grounded; it cannot rest on hunches, intuition, or mere educated guesses (para. 47).

[55]                          The phrase “random virtue testing” has denoted police investigations that overstep the entrapment doctrine’s limits (see Mack, at p. 956; Barnes, at p. 463). Some degree of “randomness” is inherent in bona fide inquiries: in approaching individuals without suspecting their personal involvement in crime, it is “inevitable” that such investigations “might unfortunately result in attracting into committing a crime someone who would not otherwise have had any involvement in criminal conduct” (Mack, at p. 956). In general, this risk only increases as a space is defined more broadly. And a broadly defined space could also cause an investigation to unduly burden the public’s ability to “go about their daily lives without courting the risk that they will be subjected to the clandestine investigatory techniques of agents of the state” (Ahmad, at para. 39, citing Barnes, at p. 480, per McLachlin J., dissenting).

[56]                          The space where police reasonably suspect crime is occurring must therefore be “carefully delineate[d]” and “defined with sufficient precision”, to “ensure the police have narrowed their scope so that the purview of their inquiry is no broader than the evidence allows” (Ahmad, at paras. 39 and 41). This is all the more critical in virtual spaces, which, lacking the constraints inherent in physical spaces, can be extremely vast in reach. While true of all spaces police may investigate, it is particularly important that online spaces are “defined narrowly and with precision” (para. 43).

[57]                          In Ahmad, the Court listed six factors that may illuminate the assessment of whether the police investigation was properly tailored: (1) the seriousness of the crime in question; (2) the time of day and the number of activities and persons who might be affected; (3) whether racial profiling, stereotyping or reliance on vulnerabilities played a part in the selection of the location; (4) the level of privacy expected in the area or space; (5) the importance of the virtual space to freedom of expression; and (6) the availability of other, less intrusive investigative techniques (para. 41).

[58]                          The Ahmad factors are contextual guides; they are neither exhaustive nor mandatory. And while they help in maintaining the entrapment doctrine’s underlying balance between “the state’s interest in investigating crime and the law’s constraint against unwarranted intrusion into individuals’ personal lives” (para. 63), the factors do not themselves require balancing. All six factors will not always be relevant or helpful — an otherwise overbroad police inquiry, for instance, is not saved by the fact that it did not involve profiling or stereotyping. But nor should one factor be allowed to overwhelm the inquiry. Even those convicted of the most serious offences may have been entrapped; conversely, those acting in the most private spaces will not necessarily be entrapped. The analysis is always contextual.

[59]                          The Court in Ahmad also made clear that the reasonable suspicion analysis turns not only on a space’s physical characteristics, but on whether the police “have narrowed their scope so that the purview of their inquiry is no broader than the evidence allows” (para. 41). This necessarily engages with the nature of the police’s suspicions, including the type and extent of the criminal activity suspected, and the nature of their investigation. Indeed, the factors expressly address the “seriousness of the crime in question” and an investigation’s impacts on people and activities in the time and place in which it occurs (para. 41). This reflects the fact that reasonable suspicion of particular criminal activity, in bona fide inquiries, is not freestanding; it exists in relation to a particular space and justifies the state in offering opportunities to commit certain crimes to “any person associated with the area” (Barnes, at p. 463 (emphasis in original)). The space, the crimes and the nature of the investigation all influence the acceptable purview of the police’s inquiry. The entire context, in short, determines whether the space of an investigation was sufficiently precise.

[60]                          Still, to date, the need for sufficient precision has played relatively little role in this Court’s cases. The investigation in Barnes grew out of suspicion of drug trafficking in the six-block area of a city, and took place in that same broad space, a narrower investigation being “unrealistic” in the circumstances (p. 461). The dial-a-dope investigation in Ahmad, too, both originated in and occurred in the virtual space of a phone number, a space that, functionally, could hardly have been more tailored. And in inherently limited spaces like those, the scope of police actions can typically only extend so far, attenuating the risks that police actions will exceed what the evidence permits.

[61]                          But such scrutiny will often be crucial when the police investigate broader virtual spaces like a website, for at least two reasons.

[62]                          First, in permeable and interactive spaces like websites, which can be subdivided in various ways, the “space” of an inquiry will not necessarily be intuitive. Project Raphael, for instance, grew out of the police’s suspicion that crime was occurring through user-created ads for the youngest sex workers posted in the escort subdirectory of Backpage; yet it was designed to only offer opportunities to those users who entered and responded to police-created ads, which were modeled after those user-created ads. The possibility of creating subspaces like this — such as postings, messages or hyperlinks within a broader website — suggests that the descriptions of online spaces may be more dynamic than those of physical spaces. And it suggests that the ways subspaces are embedded in, or relate to other online spaces may be critical for understanding how the space of an inquiry was “premised upon and tethered to reasonable suspicion” (Ahmad, at para. 20). The space — which both grounds reasonable suspicion and defines the inquiry’s purview — should thus be “carefully delineate[d]” (para. 39). The area of an online police investigation calls for close attention.  

[63]                          Second, whether an online space was sufficiently precise may turn as much on the space’s functions and interactivity as it does on its parameters. As noted, the Internet may allow the police to reach many more people, in more targeted or invasive ways, than equivalent investigations into physical spaces. For instance, the investigation in Barnes (where the police acted as in-person buyers) was unlikely to generate the flood of responses that overwhelmed the YRP in Project Raphael’s first “phase” (where the police acted as online sellers). Nor, without great efforts, could it have produced the same record of users’ personal information, including phone numbers, which was produced automatically through texting. And a website may allow the police to “fabricate identities and ‘pose’ as others to a degree that would not be possible in a public space like the Granville Mall” (Ahmad, at para. 37) — for example by veiling their identities through images or other digital representations.  

[64]                        Such functions may require tailoring the location of an online inquiry to a degree that was unnecessary in either Barnes or Ahmad, where the space’s scope and functions were already limited. They may, for example, require the police to focus on more carefully delineated spaces and target their opportunities to particular subspaces or to particular ways in which users engage with the space. This is especially true in places frequented by vulnerable groups, such as racial, religious or sexual minorities, or in spaces whose use carries important rights implications, where the need for precision is particularly critical (see Ahmad, at paras. 169-70, per Moldaver J., dissenting; D. M. Tanovich, “Rethinking the Bona Fides of Entrapment” (2011), 43 U.B.C. L. Rev. 417, at p. 432; K. Roach, “Entrapment and Equality in Terrorism Prosecutions: A Comparative Examination of North American and European Approaches” (2011), 80 Miss. L.J. 1455, at pp. 1474-75; R. v. Stack, 2022 ONCA 413 (raising but not deciding whether the accused was entrapped on Grindr, a “dating and hookup” app for men seeking men)).

[65]                        A space’s functions may also, in some cases, call for attention to how the space facilitates or inhibits data collection. The Internet’s ability to collect traces may cut in different directions. Because the accused bears the burden of proof in entrapment applications, a lack of data about the scope of an investigation — such as how many people it contacted, and in what ways — could raise fairness concerns. Yet indiscriminate data collection, without appropriate safeguards, would raise clear privacy concerns. Generally speaking, and insofar as an online space permits, police should consider whether to collect and retain data relevant to understanding an investigation’s scope, while taking care to do so in a way that minimizes the costs to privacy.

[66]                        The Ahmad factors, again, may assist. An online space’s functions and interactivity can greatly influence factors like the “number of activities and persons who might be affected”, the “level of privacy expected”, the “importance of the virtual space to freedom of expression” or whether the police’s methods were sufficiently narrow as compared to “other, less intrusive investigative techniques” (para. 41). These, alongside other concerns, may be critical in assessing whether the space was “defined narrowly and with precision” (para. 43).

[67]                        None of this is to say that broad online spaces cannot be sufficiently precise. In Ahmad, the Court explained that “entire websites or social media platforms will rarely, if ever, be sufficiently particularized to support reasonable suspicion” (para. 43). Indeed, multi-functional virtual spaces — perhaps typical of much Internet use — will usually be too broad to support reasonable suspicion. But in other spaces, the criminality may be so pervasive that it supports a reasonable suspicion over the entire area (see R. v. Nelson, 2021 BCCA 192, at paras. 13-19 (CanLII) (trafficking fentanyl and carfentanil on the dark web)). The circumference of a sufficiently precise online location may vary.

[68]                        In sum, the Internet’s unique features are inescapable in assessing whether the location is sufficiently precise to ground reasonable suspicion. Online spaces are qualitatively different (Ahmad, at para. 37) — and those differences must be considered.

C.            Rationally Connected and Proportionate Opportunities

[69]                          A second doctrinal issue arises from the facts of this case. The police suspected that the offence of communicating to obtain sexual services from a minor (s. 286.1(2)) was occurring on Backpage. But the Backpage website prevented the police from directly advertising sexual services by someone under the age of 18; instead, they had to reveal a younger age in conversation. Yet the age they revealed — 14 years — exposed Mr. Ramelson to more serious offences of child luring a person under 16. This raises the further question: what type of link must exist between the offence suspected and the offence offered? 

[70]                        Citing Mack, the Court of Appeal concluded that the child luring under 16 offences were not “totally unrelated” or “much more serious” offences than the s. 286.1(2) offence, which concerned a person under 18 years old (para. 89). Yet the phrases “totally unrelated” and “much more serious” only served in Mack to identify cases that clearly met the standard; they were not the standard itself. That standard remains the one set in Mack: that the crime that police offer must be rationally connected and proportionate to the offence they suspect is occurring.

[71]                        In the companion appeal Haniffa, Mr. Haniffa argues that bona fide inquiries, being inherently broader than investigations into individuals, ought to be restricted to offering opportunities to commit the same offences that the police suspect are occurring. But given the restrictions on bona fide inquiries that I have discussed above, such a distinction is, in my view, unnecessary. And it could unduly hinder the police’s ability to investigate certain offences. I would therefore reject it.

VI.         Application

[72]                          Mr. Ramelson’s appeal raises two issues of application: (1) whether the police had reasonable suspicion over a sufficiently precise space; and (2) if so, whether the child luring offences he was charged with were rationally connected and proportionate to the s. 286.1(2) offence.

[73]                          Like the Court of Appeal (at paras. 96-97), I conclude that the application judge erred by failing to properly consider the broader context beyond the number of people affected by the investigation. On the proper analysis, I conclude that Project Raphael was bona fide and Mr. Ramelson was not entrapped. I consider each issue in turn.

A.           Did the Police Have Reasonable Suspicion in a Sufficiently Precise Space?

[74]                          The police suspected that the s. 286.1(2) offence (communicating to obtain sexual services from a minor) was occurring within ads posted in the escort subdirectory of the York Region Backpage whose content suggested extreme youth. I agree with the Court of Appeal that the application judge erred in finding that space was insufficiently precise to ground reasonable suspicion.

[75]                          Whether the police had reasonable suspicion turns on Insp. Truong’s testimony. In some cases, a single officer’s testimony may fail to support reasonable suspicion, particularly if too closely tied to their own “personal conclusions” rather than objective fact (Ahmad, at para. 24 (emphasis deleted)). But here, it was sufficient. Insp. Truong’s testimony was grounded in his direct and indirect experiences in law enforcement: the YRP had identified 85 juvenile sex workers between 2011 and 2016; the 2013 seller-side initiative, which located 9 juveniles in 2 weeks and found that those investigated entered the industry at 14.8 years old on average; he had participated in many conferences and conversations in his professional circles; and he had interviewed hundreds of sex workers in his several years specializing in sex work-related crimes — all of which pointed to a pervasive problem stemming from a particular type of online ad on Backpage.

[76]                          This, in my view, amply showed the reasonable possibility that the s. 286.1(2) offence was occurring in the space. Indeed, it suggested that the offence was occurring regularly. If the YRP were to address offences related to juvenile sex work, ads in the York Region escort subdirectory of Backpage for the youngest sex workers were places to do so.

[77]                          The question becomes whether the officers’ reasonable suspicion related to a space that was sufficiently precise. Mr. Ramelson submits that the application judge was correct to find that Project Raphael’s scope was overbroad, since the investigation extended to an “entire website”. In stressing the need to click on and respond to the ads, and downplaying the need for closer targeting to those seeking juveniles, the Court of Appeal’s approach will “result in almost any website or social media platform being defined as narrow, even if in practice it is extremely wide” (A.F., at para. 47). And the court further discounted the number of people affected by the investigation, which was significant. The Crown responds that the space was sufficiently precise: the escort section was already limited by nature, and the information in the ads further filtered out potential respondents, to the extent that Backpage’s parameters allowed. The Court of Appeal’s review of the Ahmad factors — which emphasized the seriousness of the crime and the difficulty investigating it — reflected the correct approach.

[78]                        I agree that the application judge erred. While correctly stressing the number of people affected by the investigation, he failed to properly consider the entire context — in particular, the seriousness of the crimes and the difficulty investigating them via alternative techniques. Like the Court of Appeal, a review of the full context leads me to conclude that the online space in which Project Raphael offered opportunities was defined with sufficient precision to ground the police’s reasonable suspicion. I begin with the virtual space’s definition, which must be carefully delineated, including, as I have explained, with a view to the space’s functions and interactivity.

[79]                        At its most general, the YRP’s suspicions arose within the York Region escort subdirectory of the Backpage website. There was, to all appearances, an active hub of crime; specific posts advertising the youngest sex workers appeared daily, and unremittingly, within that broader space. And in designing Project Raphael, the YRP sought to replicate those posts, aiming to attract those who were either actively seeking a juvenile or were at least indifferent to encountering one. The space — grounding reasonable suspicion and defining the investigation’s purview — was the particular type of ads within the York Region escort subdirectory of Backpage that emphasized the sex worker’s extreme youth.

[80]                        To be sure, that space differed markedly from the physical spaces of traditional investigations. First, at a granular level, the location where the police’s suspicions first arose (the user-created ads in that subdirectory) was not identical to the location where the police later offered their opportunities (the police-created ads in the escort subdirectory); indeed, the police-posted ads did not exist until the police created them. Those specific ads, therefore, could not generate the reasonable suspicion upon which Project Raphael was grounded: the reasonable suspicion standard “insists on an objective assessment of the information the police actually had” (Ahmad, at para. 29). That assessment turns instead on the police’s suspicions over a certain type of ad for the youngest sex workers that was arising continually, and without the police’s involvement, within the broader York Region escort subdirectory of Backpage. The relationship between those user-created ads and the police-created ads — both being the same type of ads within the same subdirectory — is thus integral to the space’s definition: it explains how the police-created ads could be “premised upon and tethered to reasonable suspicion” (para. 20).  

[81]                        Second, Project Raphael illustrates how an investigation’s design may shape — and tailor — the nature of an online space according to its functions and interactivity. In modeling Project Raphael on common, independently posted ads for the youngest sex workers, the police consciously designed their ads to be functionally analogous to pre-existing ads, and to draw in a similar audience. And in listing a phone number for users to text message — a step made necessary by their functional inability to communicate through the website with those who merely clicked on the ad — the police shaped how they would interact with users and, ultimately, how they would offer opportunities to commit the offences. The space’s functions and interactivity, in other words, permitted the police to design Project Raphael in a way that narrowed the investigation’s scope.

[82]                          I therefore disagree with Mr. Ramelson that the police’s investigation extended to an “entire website”. Even the escort subdirectory as a whole was not an entire website. And users within that broader space had to take interactive steps to locate the youngest sex workers. Unlike in Barnes, where anybody within the six-block area could have been approached by the police, Backpage users would only encounter the police if they clicked on particular ads, entering police-designed subspaces, and then messaged the listed phone number. While anyone within the escort subdirectory could view the links to those postings, Project Raphael was not designed to interact with everyone within that broader space, let alone within the Backpage website as a whole.

[83]                          As noted, the ads themselves were designed, in word and image, to signal youth. In Mr. Ramelson’s case, the ad called the sex worker a “Tight Brand NEW girl . . . who is sexy and YOUNG with a tight body”, with a “YOUNG FRIEND if your interested too”. The photo featured a faceless woman wearing a t-shirt that bore the name of a local high school. And her stated age was the minimum compatible with the space’s parameters. While online information cannot always be taken at face value, and while other steps could have been taken — in one of the related appeals, Jaffer, the police included the number “16” in an email address, for instance — these were clear hints that the sex worker might have been underage. This further narrowed the space within which the police offered their opportunities.

[84]                        Mr. Ramelson was among those who took things still further: by not only browsing the escort subdirectory, and clicking on the hint-adorned ad, but by messaging the affiliated phone number and arranging an encounter — all before the police mentioned the sex worker’s age. It was at this point — when the police mentioned the sex worker’s age — that they provided him with the opportunity to commit the offences under ss. 286.1(2), 172.1 and 172.2 (see Ahmad, at paras. 63-64; R. v. Ghotra, 2020 ONCA 373, 455 D.L.R. (4th) 586, at paras. 30-31, aff’d 2021 SCC 12). By agreeing to proceed with the transaction, all the elements of the offences were satisfied (R. v. Levigne, 2010 SCC 25, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 23).

[85]                          These features limited Project Raphael’s purview. Still, being an online investigation, the number of people it affected was potentially far greater than an analogous investigation in a physical space, even with users having to take steps to encounter the police. Because the police never kept statistics, there are no precise numbers. But most who responded to the police’s ads, it appears, immediately disengaged once they were told the sex worker’s age (C.A. reasons, at paras. 141-42). This supports an inference that Project Raphael affected many who would not have offended independently. For the application judge, this was a crucial concern. And I agree that that this raises legitimate concerns.  

[86]                          Much of Project Raphael’s breadth lay in the nature of the police’s offer. The point is again made clear through a comparison with Barnes. The police there approached people individually, seeking those with easy access to drugs who were willing sellers. This necessarily limited the number of people who could actually take advantage of the opportunity. Here, by contrast, the investigation occurred online, through ads potentially available to everyone in the escort subdirectory, and sought those who, already intent on a sexual transaction, were willing buyers. This made it more likely that users would avail themselves of the police’s opportunity, and more likely that the investigation would ensnare those who would not have committed the offences on their own.

[87]                          A related issue was Project Raphael’s conscious targeting of those who were only indifferent about the sex worker’s age. This troubled the application judge: he noted that it captured individuals who were not seeking to commit the suspected offence. By definition, such people may not have offended absent the police’s offer, suggesting that their inclusion in Project Raphael may have manufactured crimes that would not have occurred on their own — one of the key risks targeted by the entrapment doctrine (Barnes, at p. 459; Ahmad, at para. 28). 

[88]                        In this specific context, however, I agree with the Court of Appeal that the “merely indifferent” were legitimate targets of the investigation (para. 124). As inchoate offences, the s. 286.1(2) and child luring offences target those who, knowing the person’s age, or being willfully blind to it, decide to pursue sexual activity anyway — regardless of whether they initially sought a juvenile or whether they actually carry out the agreement. Aiming to “close the cyberspace door” before things proceed any further (R. v. Legare, 2009 SCC 56, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 551, at para. 25), the offences embody a particularly proactive approach to crime, criminalizing mere agreements to proceed in the face of certain facts. Capturing the “merely indifferent” only reflects the nature of the offence. It reflects Parliament’s own judgment about when such conversations cross a line, and suggests there is a legitimate law enforcement interest in the police intervening at a relatively early stage.

[89]                        Another key concern was privacy. I agree with the Court of Appeal that Project Raphael “intruded upon an intensely personal privacy interest” (para. 135). The text message communications that followed for users who clicked on the ads and contacted the phone number disclosed intimate details about those users’ sexual preferences, details they would naturally expect would remain confidential from the state.

[90]                        Privacy and free expression interests are often interrelated, since a loss of privacy often precedes self-censorship. The Court of Appeal also concluded that, being illegal and falling outside traditional categories of expression valued in a democratic society, buyers’ expression in this case carried little weight (para. 136). For similar reasons, it concluded that Project Raphael did not intrude on other public activities of value (paras. 127-29). But although crime was apparently pervasive within the types of ads targeted by the investigation, communications in those spaces were not necessarily illegal — a person may communicate with a sex worker without intending to hire them for sex. And the police’s presence in an online space may chill any of the expression in that space, legal or illegal. Still, I agree that Project Raphael did not intrude on public activities of great value and the privacy interests in this case were greatly attenuated.

[91]                          Most importantly, these factors were only part of the context in which police offered the opportunities in Project Raphael. The nature of the offences and the lack of alternative investigative techniques were key factors in this case; yet ones the application judge mentioned only briefly (second ruling on entrapment, at para. 22).

[92]                        The offences were not only apparently prevalent; they were serious and difficult to investigate except through proactive methods. All involved communications to arrange a sexual encounter with a minor, a “very real threat”, for which Parliament, recognizing their gravity, has criminalized preparatory actions to the intended conduct itself (R. v. Morrison, 2019 SCC 15, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 39-40). The difficulty investigating “consensual” crimes of this type has long been recognized, even before those crimes moved online (Kirzner v. The Queen, 1977 CanLII 38 (SCC), [1978] 2 S.C.R. 487, at pp. 492-93; Amato v. The Queen, 1982 CanLII 31 (SCC), [1982] 2 S.C.R. 418, at p. 457, per Estey J., dissenting, but not on this point; Mack, at pp. 916-17; Ahmad, at para. 18). And sting operations have become “an important tool — if not the most important tool — available to the police in detecting offenders who target children and preventing them from doing actual harm to children” (R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, at para. 94). Given the “considerable latitude” police are owed in their investigations (Mack, at p. 917), sting operations like Project Raphael should not be foreclosed lightly.

[93]                        In all the circumstances, I would conclude that ads posted in Backpage’s escort subdirectory emphasizing the sex worker’s extreme youth were a sufficiently precise space to ground reasonable suspicion. Project Raphael carefully tailored the ads in which police provided the opportunity to commit the offences. The broader escort subdirectory was designed to facilitate sex-work related crimes, limiting the targeted audience. Like the user-created ads, the police-created ads indicated extreme youth, including showing the person wearing a t-shirt with the logo of a local high school. Users had to interact with those ads by text message to encounter the police. This was a serious inchoate offence involving juveniles. And it is unclear what alternative methods of investigation the police might have employed — the limitations of a seller-side investigation having already been demonstrated. Although the investigation impacted many individuals, in context, “the purview of the police inquiry [went] no broader than the evidence allow[ed]” (Ahmad, at para. 41).

B.            Were the Offences Rationally Connected and Proportionate?

[94]                          Mr. Ramelson’s final argument is that even if the police had reasonable suspicion that the s. 286.1(2) offence was being committed on the escort subdirectory of Backpage, it did not allow them to offer the opportunity to commit other, more serious offences under ss. 172.1(1)(b) and 172.2(1)(b). In other words, having reasonable suspicion that users were committing offences in respect of those under 18 did not allow them to offer opportunities in respect of those under 16. That “bait-and-switch” exposed Mr. Ramelson to a much longer sentence, for offences that were too remote from the police’s suspicion. 

[95]                          I disagree. While the police indeed lacked reasonable suspicion over the child luring offences, they were nonetheless rationally connected and proportionate to the s. 286.1(2) offence.

[96]                          I note first that the question only arises because of a lack of specificity in the evidence grounding the police’s reasonable suspicion — while the police had reason to suspect that sex workers under 16 were active on Backpage, there was too little evidence that buyers were seeking them specifically. As the Court of Appeal correctly noted, the focus had to be on the buyers’ intentions (para. 73).

[97]                          Some basic features of the offences suggest they are rationally connected. For one, they capture similar conduct, criminalizing telecommunications for the purpose of committing a sexual offence with a person under a specified age. The Court of Appeal noted their shared elements, explaining that the police would inevitably offer the opportunity to commit child luring in the course of offering the opportunity to commit the s. 286.1(2) offence (para. 86).

[98]                          The difference in age is concerning. Yet it rested on an evidentiary basis: those sex workers identified in the YRP’s 2013 seller-side investigation, for instance, first started selling sex at age 14.8 on average. Even small differences in age can, of course, make a big difference in sexual offences. But in light of the facts, it is unsurprising, in my view, that their investigation into juvenile sex work would target buyers looking for those under 16.

[99]                          In my view, offering the opportunity to commit the child luring offences was not disproportionate. To use this Court’s language in Mack, whether child luring is a “much more serious” offence than the s. 286.1(2) offence might be an indicator of proportionality. Granted, luring a person under the age of 16 is more serious and “subject to a longer period of incarceration” than committing the s. 286.1(2) offence in respect of a person under 18 (C.A. reasons, at para. 89). In some cases, differences in seriousness and punishment will go too far. Here, however, luring a person under 16 is not a disproportionately more serious crime than communicating to obtain sexual services from a minor. With a gap of six months separating the offences’ mandatory minimum sentences, they remain comparable.

[100]                     I would therefore not accede to Mr. Ramelson’s argument. The offences were rationally connected and proportionate, such that the police could offer opportunities to commit them given their reasonable suspicion in the s. 286.1(2) offence.  

VII.      Conclusion

[101]                     For these reasons, I conclude that the police had reasonable suspicion in a space defined with sufficient precision, and the offences offered were rationally connected and proportionate to each other. The police’s genuine law enforcement purpose is not at issue. Project Raphael was thus a bona fide inquiry and Mr. Ramelson was not entrapped. I would dismiss the appeal.

                    Appeal dismissed.

                  Karakatsanis J. —

[1]                              The appellant, Muhammad Abbas Jaffer, was 1 of 104 people arrested over the course of “Project Raphael”, an online investigation of the York Regional Police which targeted the buyer side of the juvenile sex work market. His appeal before this Court was heard together with three others, each concerning the doctrine of entrapment in the context of an online police investigation. The companion cases, with reasons released concurrently, are R. v. Ramelson, 2022 SCC 44, R. v. Haniffa, 2022 SCC 46, and R. v. Dare, 2022 SCC 47. Like two of the other three appellants, Mr. Jaffer’s appeal is from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing his conviction appeal and his appeal from the application judge’s dismissal of his entrapment application. His appeal raises two issues: (1) whether the police had reasonable suspicion over him personally, or acted pursuant to a bona fide inquiry when they presented him with the opportunity to commit the offences (thus satisfying the opportunity-based branch of the entrapment doctrine); and (2) whether he was induced.

[2]                              On October 24, 2014, while browsing the escort subdirectory of Backpage.com, Mr. Jaffer messaged “Kathy”, aged 18, who was described as a “Tight Brand New girl” who is “sexy and young with a tight body” (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 13 and 23). The posting listed a phone number and an email address titled “kathyblunt16@gmail.com” (pp. 13 and 23). Communicating by text with Mr. Jaffer, the undercover officer (UC) eventually revealed to him that “she” was 15 years old:

[20:56 – UC]: . . . how old r u

 

[20:57 – Jaffer]: 22

 

. . .

 

[21:00 – UC]: . . . well im not quite 18 yet r u ok with that

 

. . .

 

[21:00 – Jaffer]: Yeah I’m ok . . . but how much younger are u? 17?

 

[21:01 – UC]: im turning 16 on sunday but I look 18

 

[21:02 – Jaffer]: Um . . . ok but how do I know you’re not a cop?

 

[21:02 – Jaffer]: I really don’t want to get in trouble ya know

 

[21:03 – UC]: and i definitely don’t want trouble

 

[21:03 – Jaffer]: Ok can I ask why you’re escorting if it’s ok with u? Usually people your age don’t know about this industry

 

[21:04 – Jaffer]: Just curios

 

[21:04 – UC]: my friend got me into it . . . i just need the money i dont do this all the time its my second time honestly i need the money :)

 

[21:05 – Jaffer]: I see . . . I like that you’re honest. I can trust u then :). So I’ll come then but please please let’s keep this between ourselves

 

(A.R., vol. II, at p. 28)

[3]                              When Mr. Jaffer arrived at the designated hotel room, he was arrested. He was charged and tried with 2 offences: telecommunicating with a person he believed to be under the age of 18 contrary to s. 172.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985,
c. C-46 (child luring under 18), and communicating to obtain for consideration the sexual services of a person under 18 contrary to s. 212(4) (now s. 286.1(2)) (communicating to obtain sexual services from a minor).

[4]                              A jury convicted him on both counts, yet the sentencing judge stayed his conviction on s. 212(4) pursuant to Kienapple v. The Queen, 1974 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. Mr. Jaffer then brought an application for a stay of proceedings, arguing that he had been entrapped.

[5]                              The application judge dismissed Mr. Jaffer’s application. She concluded that Project Raphael was a bona fide inquiry: Inspector Truong — the officer who designed Project Raphael — was well-experienced in sex work-related offences and gave evidence that Backpage was “continually associated” with juvenile sex work; the offences were “challenging to investigate”; and the activity on Backpage “could readily be identified to be within specific geographical areas” (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 27‑28). The police, further, had reasonable suspicion that Mr. Jaffer was engaged in criminal activity when they made the offer.

[6]                              The Court of Appeal dismissed Mr. Jaffer’s arguments on opportunity‑based entrapment for its reasons given in R. v. Ramelson, 2021 ONCA 328, 155 O.R. (3d) 481 (see 2021 ONCA 325, 155 O.R. (3d) 535, at paras. 15-16). And it dismissed his further argument that he had been induced, citing the application judge’s finding that Mr. Jaffer “was determined to purchase sexual services and gave specific consideration to the information as to the age of the purveyor before he acted on his choices” (para. 22).

[7]                              Mr. Jaffer adopts the arguments raised in the companion appeals as they concern opportunity-based entrapment, adding that the police lacked reasonable suspicion over him personally. I have addressed these points in my reasons in Ramelson, where I concluded that Project Raphael was a bona fide inquiry. For the reasons given in that case, I would not accede to these grounds of appeal.

[8]                              Mr. Jaffer’s second argument is that the courts below erred in failing to take his personal circumstances into account when assessing whether he was induced. Mr. Jaffer acknowledges that the police could not have known that he was living with undiagnosed Asperger’s Syndrome, but submits that such personal circumstances are relevant and ought to be considered in the analysis of inducement-based entrapment. Mr. Jaffer explains that the common symptoms of his condition — in particular, a difficulty socializing and rigid rule compliance — put him at a heightened risk for being induced. In addition, that condition, and an earlier interaction he had with police, where he had agreed to provide information about a particular sex worker and her pimp, lent credence to his explanation that he had planned to meet “Kathy” only to gather information and alert the authorities.  

[9]                              The inducement branch of the entrapment doctrine provides that even if the police have reasonable suspicion over an individual or act under a bona fide inquiry, they cannot “emplo[y] means which go further than providing an opportunity” to commit a crime (R. v. Mack, 1988 CanLII 24 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, at p. 966). That assessment may include looking at “whether an average person, with both strengths and weaknesses, in the position of the accused would be induced into the commission of a crime” or whether the police “appear to have exploited a particular vulnerability of a person such as a mental handicap or a substance addiction”, among other factors (p. 966). But the assessment is objective and focuses on the police’s conduct, not on that conduct’s effect “on the accused’s state of mind” (p. 965).

[10]                          In my view, the issue of whether that framework ought to be revised is better left for another case. Whatever the merit of Mr. Jaffer’s legal arguments — a point I do not decide here — the jury, in full knowledge of Mr. Jaffer’s circumstances, rejected his evidence that he had intended to visit the hotel room solely to gather information. In convicting him, the jury did not have a reasonable doubt about the purpose for which he arranged the meeting. Echoing that conclusion, the application judge found that Mr. Jaffer had been intent on a sexual transaction, even after learning the sex worker’s age. No error in those findings has been demonstrated. Nor has Mr. Jaffer pointed to any indication that the police “employed means which go further than providing an opportunity” to commit the offences (Mack, at p. 966). Even if Mr. Jaffer’s subjective circumstances were considered under the legal framework for inducement, then, they could not affect the result. I would not accede to this ground of appeal.

[11]                          For these reasons, Mr. Jaffer was not entrapped. I would dismiss the appeal.

                    Appeal dismissed.

                  Karakatsanis J. —

[1]                              The appellant, Erhard Haniffa, was 1 of 104 people arrested over the course of “Project Raphael”, an online investigation of the York Regional Police which targeted the buyer side of the juvenile sex work market. His appeal was heard together with three others, each concerning the doctrine of entrapment in the context of the Project Raphael online police investigation. The companion cases, with reasons released concurrently, are R. v. Ramelson, 2022 SCC 44, R. v. Jaffer, 2022 SCC 45 and R. v. Dare, 2022 SCC 47. Like two of the other three appellants, Mr. Haniffa’s appeal is from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing his conviction appeal and his appeal from the application judge’s dismissal of his entrapment application.

[2]                              Mr. Haniffa’s appeal concerns the bona fide inquiry prong of the entrapment doctrine in relation to Project Raphael. Because I consider these issues at length in Ramelson and because the disposition of this appeal is necessarily the same, my reasons here are brief.

[3]                              On March 22, 2016, while browsing the escort subdirectory of Backpage.com, Mr. Haniffa responded to an ad purportedly placed by “Jamie”. The ad indicated she was 18 years old (the minimum age allowed by the website), and described her as “YOUNG Shy FRESH and NEW”, “super new to this and pretty shy” and as having a friend who is “young like me” (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 5). Communicating with Mr. Haniffa by text, the undercover officer (UC) eventually revealed to him that “she” was 15 years old:

[11:13 – Haniffa]: U busy?

 

[13:09 – UC]: im free tn after school

 

[13:13 – Haniffa]: What time is school done?

 

[13:19 – UC]: 330

 

. . .

 

[14:35 – UC]: r u ok if im not quite 18 yet?

 

[14:53 – Haniffa]: Is this like a cop thing or something?

 

[14:53 – Haniffa]: Can u call u?

 

[15:00 – UC]: .no silly

 

[15:01 – Haniffa]: How old r u?

 

. . .

 

[16:18 – UC]: im 15 to be hones but I look older hun

 

[16:20 – Haniffa]: Mm

 

[16:20 – Haniffa]: Ok so where will u be working?

 

[16:24 – UC]: why the mm babe

 

[16:27 – Haniffa]: As in mm ok

 

(A.R., vol. VI, at pp. 13-15)

[4]                              When Mr. Haniffa arrived at the designated hotel room, he was arrested. He was charged with 3 offences: telecommunicating with a person he believed to be under the age of 18 years, for the purpose of committing an offence under s. 286.1(2) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (communicating to obtain sexual services from a minor), contrary to s. 172.1(1)(a); telecommunicating with a person he believed to be under the age of 16 years for the purpose of committing an offence under s. 152 (invitation to sexual touching), contrary to s. 172.1(1)(b); and communicating to obtain sexual services for consideration from a person under 18 years, contrary to s. 286.1(2).

[5]                              Mr. Haniffa was convicted at trial of all three counts, but his conviction under s. 172.1(1)(a) was stayed pursuant to Kienapple v. The Queen, 1974 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. He then brought an application for a stay of proceedings on the basis that he had been entrapped.

[6]                              The application judge dismissed the application, concluding that Project Raphael was a bona fide inquiry. The Court of Appeal then dismissed Mr. Haniffa’s appeal for its reasons in R. v. Ramelson, 2021 ONCA 328, 155 O.R. (3d) 481, which addressed the common issue of whether the individuals arrested through Project Raphael were entrapped (2021 ONCA 326, 155 O.R. (3d) 523, at para. 46).

[7]                              In this appeal, Mr. Haniffa adopts the questions in issue as set out in the appellant’s factum in Ramelson, and acknowledges that “the facts of the present case are sufficiently similar, so that the same conclusions must follow” (A.F., at para. 41). Many of his arguments mirror those raised in Ramelson, but he raises some additional points. Inspector Truong’s evidence, he says, was insufficient to ground reasonable suspicion: it was based too heavily on his personal experiences, failed to show the targeted offences were prevalent, and failed to explain how a user would actually locate a juvenile sex worker through the website, given its parameters. And given the potential breadth of investigations into spaces, the police should be limited, in the context of bona fide inquiries, to offering the same offences they suspect are occurring; they should not be entitled to offer those that are only rationally connected and proportionate (see R. v. Mack, 1988 CanLII 24 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, at p. 958).

[8]                              For the reasons given in Ramelson, I would not accede to these arguments. As I explained there, the police had reasonable suspicion over a sufficiently precise space and the Mack standard of “rationally connected and proportionate” applies and was satisfied. Project Raphael was thus a bona fide inquiry. I conclude that Mr. Haniffa was not entrapped.

[9]                              For these reasons, I would dismiss Mr. Haniffa’s appeal.

                    Appeal dismissed.

[1]                              The appellant, Temitope Dare, was 1 of 104 people arrested over the course of “Project Raphael”, an online investigation of the York Regional Police which targeted the buyer side of the juvenile sex work market. His appeal before this Court was heard together with three others, each concerning the doctrine of entrapment in the context of the Project Raphael online police investigation. The companion cases, with reasons released concurrently, are R. v. Ramelson, 2022 SCC 44, R. v. Jaffer, 2022 SCC 45 and R. v. Haniffa, 2022 SCC 46. Like two of the other three appellants, Mr. Dare’s appeal is from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing his conviction appeal and his appeal from the application judge’s dismissal of his entrapment application.

[2]                              Mr. Dare’s appeal concerns the bona fide inquiry prong of the entrapment doctrine in relation to Project Raphael. Because I consider these issues at length in Ramelson and because the disposition of this appeal is necessarily the same, my reasons here are brief.

[3]                              On March 25, 2016, while browsing the escort subdirectory of Backpage.com, Mr. Dare responded to an ad purportedly placed by “Kathy”. The ad indicated she was 18 years old (the minimum age allowed by the website), described her as a “Tight Brand New girl . . . who is sexy and young with a tight body”, and stated that she had a “YOUNG FRIEND” (R.R., vol. IV, at p. 118). Communicating with Mr. Dare by text, the undercover officer (UC) eventually revealed to him that “she” was 15 years old:

[03:26 – UC]: You cool with young?

 

[03:26 – Dare]: Yes

 

[03:27 – Dare]: Am also young

 

[03:27 – UC]: Ok cool. I’m 15 but look bit older.

 

. . .

 

[03:28 – UC]: How old are you if don’t mind me asking?

 

[03:29 – Dare]: Ok am 22

 

(R.R., vol. IV, at pp. 121-22)

[4]                              When Mr. Dare arrived at the designated hotel room, he was arrested. He was charged with 3 offences: telecommunicating with a person he believed to be under the age of 18 years, for the purpose of committing an offence under s. 286.1(2) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (communicating to obtain sexual services from a minor), contrary to s. 172.1(1)(a); telecommunicating with a person he believed to be under the age of 16 years for the purpose of committing an offence under s. 152 (invitation to sexual touching), contrary to s. 172.1(1)(b); and communicating to obtain sexual services for consideration from a person under 18 years, contrary to s. 286.1(2).

[5]                              The jury convicted Mr. Dare on all three counts, but his convictions under ss. 172.1(1)(b) and 286.1(2) were stayed pursuant to Kienapple v. The Queen, 1974 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. Mr. Dare then brought an application for a stay of proceedings, arguing that he had been entrapped.

[6]                              The application judge dismissed the application, concluding that Project Raphael was based on the police’s reasonable suspicion that the offences were occurring within a sufficiently precise space. Since the police did “everything possible within the confines of Backpage” to limit the pool of people who would select the ad to those interested in obtaining the sexual services of a young person, the police conduct did not amount to random virtue testing (A.R., vol. I, at p. 8). The Court of Appeal then dismissed Mr. Dare’s appeal for its reasons in R. v. Ramelson, 2021 ONCA 328, 155 O.R. (3d) 481, which addressed the common issue of whether the individuals arrested through Project Raphael were entrapped (2021 ONCA 327, 155 O.R. (3d) 516, at para. 28).

[7]                              In this appeal, Mr. Dare adopts the appellant submissions made in Ramelson and Haniffa, stating that “the facts in the present case are sufficiently similar, so that the same conclusions ought to follow” (A.F., at para. 23). For the reasons I have given in Ramelson, where I concluded that Project Raphael was a bona fide inquiry, I would not accede to Mr. Dare’s grounds of appeal. He was not entrapped. I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

                    Appeal dismissed.

                  Kasirer J. —

I.               Overview

[1]                              An accident occurred when a commercial flight from Toronto landed in Halifax. A number of people were hurt. Property, including the aircraft, was damaged. Some of the passengers commenced a class action alleging that negligence on the part of the airline, its pilots, the aircraft manufacturer, the airport and others had caused them harm.

[2]                              In an exercise unrelated to the civil action, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (“Board”), an independent federal agency, investigated the accident pursuant to its statutory mandate to advance transportation safety. The Board released a report to the public indicating the causes or contributing factors of the accident and the safety measures to be taken by those concerned. In keeping with its role, the Board did not assign blame for the incident.

[3]                              One of the defendants in the class action, Airbus S.A.S., brought an interlocutory motion before the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia seeking an order that the Board release the cockpit voice recorder (“CVR”) containing the flight crew’s communications — part of the so‑called “black box” from the aircraft — as well as the transcripts made of the recorded data. The Board, a stranger to the litigation, had the only copy of the CVR and used it in the preparation of its report. The defendant Airbus, the aircraft manufacturer, said the release of the device was necessary for a fair trial, in particular to resolve the causation issue that would be central to the civil action. The motion alleged that what happened on landing, key to determining who was responsible for the alleged losses, was not clear from the pilots’ testimony on discovery and this missing evidence was otherwise unobtainable. The Board opposed the motion for disclosure. It was joined in this by the defendant airline, Air Canada, and its pilots, who are alleged to have acted negligently. For the Board, the CVR was subject to a statutory privilege and consequently could not be produced in evidence in the civil action.

[4]                              As an “on‑board recording”, the CVR is indeed privileged under s. 28 of the Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board Act, S.C. 1989, c. 3 (“Act”).[1] No one can be required to produce the CVR or give evidence relating to it in legal proceedings, except with the authorization of a court or coroner.

[5]                              After listening to the CVR in camera, the chambers judge decided it was reliable and relevant evidence that was necessary to resolving the dispute. He ordered the Board to release the privileged recording to the parties, subject to what he called “very stringent conditions” to protect its confidentiality. In the judge’s view, production of the CVR was permitted because, according to the test set forth in the Act, the public interest in the proper administration of justice outweighed in importance the privilege attached to the on‑board recording. His interlocutory judgment was confirmed on appeal. The Board appeals to this Court to assert the statutory privilege. It says, in essence, that Parliament’s purposes in establishing the privilege — protecting pilot privacy and promoting public safety in air transportation — would be undermined if the CVR were disclosed in the class action.

[6]                              Where a person seeks to exclude relevant evidence in a civil action on the strength of a statutory privilege, they pit the search for truth — what this Court called “the cardinal principle in civil proceedings” in Imperial Oil v. Jacques, 2014 SCC 66, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 287, at para. 24 — against matters of public policy, distinct from the trial process, that the legislature has seen fit to protect by preventing disclosure of information before the courts. The truth‑seeking function of the law of evidence in a civil trial is thus in “tension” with these other values that the legislature has chosen to champion by statute in establishing the privilege (I borrow the term [translation] “tension” in this context from scholar Julien Fournier, “Les privilèges en droit de la preuve: un nécessaire retour aux sources” (2019), 53 R.J.T.U.M. 461, at p. 468). Often, the legislature will stipulate how this tension should be resolved, for example by directing that the privilege is absolute, or by recognizing discrete exceptions, or again by providing a decision‑maker with the discretion to decide whether or not the truth‑seeking should give way to the privilege. Subject to constitutional constraints, the courts should abide by the choice reflected in a statutory privilege and recognize that, where the legislature has given pride of place to a privilege, otherwise relevant and trustworthy evidence that might advance the just resolution of a civil trial will be excluded by “overriding societal interests” (S. N. Lederman, M. K. Fuerst and H. C. Stewart, Sopinka, Lederman & Bryant: The Law of Evidence in Canada (6th ed. 2022), at ¶14.1).

[7]                              This appeal invites the Court to consider the circumstances in which Parliament has said that the privilege over the CVR should take precedence over the presumably relevant and trustworthy evidence that the CVR might provide at trial on the merits of the class action. The outcome of the appeal turns on the will of Parliament as to how this tension should be resolved under the Act. In my view, the courts should not impose their own sense of when evidence should be produced where, by valid statute, the legislature has said how values other than the truth‑seeking function of the law of evidence should take precedence in civil, administrative or criminal proceedings.

[8]                              As I shall endeavour to explain, in this instance, Parliament has tempered its preference that the CVR be inaccessible to civil litigants. The privilege it created is [translation] “discretionary”, as opposed to a non‑discretionary statutory privilege with or without fixed exceptions (see Fournier, at p. 495). Unlike absolute statutory privileges, for which a court has no power to weigh the relative merits of the societal interests against the search for truth in a civil trial, a discretionary privilege typically tasks a decision‑maker with weighing the public interest reflected in the privilege against the truth‑seeking role of the law of evidence according to identifiable criteria. On the contrary, where the legislature chooses to create or recognize a non‑discretionary privilege, the decision‑maker does not have a weighing function. Rather, the decision-maker must apply the privilege, as the statute directs, subject to any exception recognized by law.

[9]                              By creating a privilege under s. 28 of the Act that excludes the CVR from production and discovery in proceedings before a court or coroner, Parliament recognized that the values of pilot privacy and aviation safety presumptively outweigh the values underlying the administration of justice, such as trial fairness. But Parliament has invested courts and coroners with the power to order the production of the CVR where “the public interest in the proper administration of justice outweighs in importance the privilege attached to the on‑board recording by virtue of this section”. Unlike certain other statutory privileges, Parliament has not expressly set out the criteria for the exercise of this discretion. This appeal turns on the identification and application of those criteria. A court or coroner seized of a request for production and discovery of an on-board recording pursuant to s. 28(6)(c) is charged with deciding whether the public’s stake in the administration of justice — ultimately rooted in trial fairness — outweighs in importance the interests Parliament sought to protect in establishing the privilege. In this balancing exercise, the decision‑maker must place two competing public interests on the scales: on one side, the relevance, probative value and necessity of the on-board recording to the fair resolution of the dispute and, on the other, the effects of disclosure on pilot privacy and aviation safety.

[10]                          For the reasons that follow, I would uphold the chambers judge’s discretionary decision to permit production and discovery of the CVR at trial and dismiss the appeal. First, the chambers judge correctly identified, as a matter of law, the underlying purposes of pilot privacy and public safety in air transportation relevant to weighing the “importance of the privilege” as recognized by Parliament. Second, he did not adopt an interpretation of the counterweighted “public interest in the proper administration of justice” that undermined the statutory privilege bearing on the CVR. He did not, for example, suggest that the importance of the privilege could be outweighed merely because the CVR was relevant and trustworthy. The judge was satisfied that the information in the privileged on‑board recording could not be produced in evidence by any other reasonable means. He thus ordered disclosure of the CVR not just because it was highly probative but, first and foremost, because it was necessary to resolve the civil action. To exclude it could have precluded a fair trial on a matter central to the dispute.

[11]                          Mindful of the constraints on his task, the chambers judge exercised the discretion afforded to him by Parliament. He ordered the release of the CVR subject to conditions that would, notwithstanding disclosure, assure a measure of confidentiality and, as Parliament directed, prohibit the use of the on‑board recording in certain other proceedings (s. 28(7) of the Act). In my view, the judge’s discretionary choice deserves deference on appeal; that was Parliament’s intention under the Act when it created a discretionary privilege.

[12]                          I would also reject the Board’s argument that, as a general proposition, the Act provides it with the right to make submissions on the scope of the privilege privately with the judge and in the absence of other parties. Properly interpreted, the Act provides no such general entitlement. While Parliament does not preclude a court or coroner from asking the Board for assistance with its in camera review of the on‑board recording, the chambers judge made no error in refusing the Board’s request as such submissions were not, in his view, necessary in this case.

II.            Background

[13]                        The accident occurred when Air Canada Flight AC624 landed in wind and snow late on a March night in 2015 at Nova Scotia’s Halifax Stanfield International Airport. The Airbus Industrie A320-211 was carrying 133 passengers and 5 crew members. On descent, the aircraft struck the ground about 740 feet short of the runway before sliding to an eventual stop. A number of people were injured, including 25 who were taken to local hospitals. While there was no post‑impact fire, the aircraft was later destroyed.

[14]                        The Board has a statutory mandate to advance transportation safety by conducting independent investigations into “transportation occurrences” (s. 2 of the Act; the French‑language equivalent, “accident de transport”, is arguably more telling than “transportation occurrence”). The Board undertook an investigation into the Halifax accident in order to make findings, as charged by s. 7(1) of the Act, as to its causes and contributing factors, to identify and reduce or eliminate safety deficiencies evidenced by the event and to report on the investigation to the public. In keeping with its mandate, the Board’s purpose in conducting and reporting on the investigation was not to assign fault. Its findings cannot be construed as assigning fault or used to determine civil or criminal liability (s. 7(2), (3) and (4)).

[15]                        The Board collected two flight recorders from Flight AC624 following the accident. The CVR contains sounds in the cockpit, including conversations among members of the flight crew. The flight data recorder (“FDR”) records flight parameters, including altitude and airspeed. After retrieving the CVR, the Board downloaded the data electronically. It then erased the material before returning the recorder to the aircraft owner.

[16]                        Drawing on a range of materials, including interviews with the flight crew and the CVR, the Board prepared a report of the occurrence that was subsequently released to the public. According to affidavit evidence produced by Mr. Jean L. Laporte, the Board’s Chief Operating Officer, investigators reviewed the CVR and used it along with the data in the FDR to “recreate the cockpit environment on descent and landing” (A.R., at p. 1862, para. 57).

[17]                        While the CVR is privileged, the Board may make such use of the recording as it considers necessary in the interests of transportation safety (s. 28(4) of the Act). The Board’s report in this case includes references to and quotations from the CVR contents. The first page of the report notes that the Board is not permitted to communicate the contents of the CVR on matters unrelated to the causes or contributing factors of the accident or to the identification of safety deficiencies. It also states that the CVR information included in the report has been “carefully examined in order to ensure that it is required to advance transportation safety” (Transportation Safety Board of Canada, Aviation Investigation Report A15H0002 (2017), at p. 1).

[18]                        According to the Board’s reported findings as to the causes and contributing factors of the occurrence, the aircraft touched down in advance of the runway because of low visibility, airline standard operating procedures and inappropriate decisions made by the flight crew, including a failure to monitor the angle of the aircraft while it was descending. Among the other factors mentioned, the Board also concluded that the lighting conditions on the runway were inadequate.

[19]                        Following the accident, a class action was commenced on behalf of certain passengers seeking damages against Air Canada (the air carrier responsible for the flight and employer of the pilots), Airbus (the aircraft manufacturer), Halifax International Airport Authority (the airport operator), NAV CANADA (the air navigation service provider), the Attorney General of Canada (representing Transport Canada as the owner and occupier of the airport), and John Doe #1 and #2 (the Captain and First Officer). The plaintiffs allege that the injuries and financial losses they suffered as a result of the accident were caused by the negligence of the defendants, including the negligence of the flight crew, inadequate training of the flight crew, inadequate runway lighting and landing systems, as well as inadequate weather observations and communications and inadequate safety precautions taken in anticipation of landing.

[20]                        The plaintiffs’ claim against Air Canada and the flight crew is of particular relevance to this appeal. In addition to allegations that Air Canada provided substandard training for the flight crew, the plaintiffs allege that the airline improperly managed the risks associated with the procedure for landing the aircraft used by the flight crew and adopted an approach procedure that lacked an adequate margin of safety. They also say that Air Canada is vicariously liable, as employer, for loss caused by the flight crew’s negligence, which they allege includes not complying with regulatory minimums for visibility prior to approach, choosing not to abort the landing and divert to another airport, not requesting updated weather information from air traffic control, not following the instructions of air traffic control, not declaring an emergency in a timely manner, and operating the aircraft without due care and skill. The other defendants, Airbus, the Attorney General of Canada, NAV CANADA, and Halifax International Airport Authority, filed cross‑claims against Air Canada and the flight crew on the same basis as part of their defences. Air Canada denies negligence on its part or on the part of its employees and similarly cross‑claims against its co‑defendants.

[21]                        The Board is not a party to the proceedings. The class action was certified in 2016. Pleadings are now closed and disclosure and discovery are complete.

[22]                        As part of its defence and cross‑claim, Airbus filed an interlocutory motion pursuant to s. 28(6) of the Act for disclosure of the audio and transcript of the CVR from the Board. In its application, which is at the origin of this appeal, Airbus stated that it does not seek release of portions of the CVR that contain purely personal discussions amongst members of the flight crew. It only seeks the flight crew’s utterances that are directly relevant to a matter in issue. Airbus noted several key questions essential to resolving the liability of Air Canada and the flight crew that require release of the CVR. These include whether the flight crew noticed that the airplane diverted from the pre‑set descent path; why they failed to notice the divergence or, if they noticed the divergence, why they did not take steps to avoid the accident; and whether they had sufficient visual cues to continue with the landing. Airbus noted, too, that this evidence could not be obtained from the flight crew, as they could not remember crucial details when questioned at examination on discovery. Without the CVR to fill these evidentiary gaps, says Airbus, a fair trial of the class action would not be possible because there are no other reliable or admissible sources for much of this evidence. Noting that the Board relied on the CVR for its report, Airbus alleges that it is plain that the Board needed this material to supplement information received from the pilots in order to understand what happened on the flight. At paragraph 55 of its motion, Airbus states:

In short, the CVR recording contains unique information that is highly relevant to the claims and defenses and may reveal crucial evidence that is absent from the current evidentiary record. It is evidence that cannot be obtained from any other sources, and is necessary to ensure the parties obtain a fair trial.

 

(A.R., at p. 1300)

[23]                        Furthermore, Airbus proposed that the production of the CVR be subject to stringent conditions to protect the confidentiality of the on‑board recording. Airbus’s application was supported by the plaintiffs and several other defendants, who generally expressed agreement that production of the CVR is necessary to the success of their respective positions.

[24]                        The Board remains in possession of the CVR. It was granted intervener status and permitted to make submissions before the chambers judge. The Air Canada Pilots’ Association (“ACPA”) was also granted intervener status. They both argued against disclosure of the CVR. Air Canada and the flight crew opposed disclosure before the chambers judge. They continue to support the position advanced by the Board but made no written or oral submissions before our Court.

III.         Decisions Below

A.           Supreme Court of Nova Scotia

(1)         Decision Rendered Orally on September 4, 2019 (Duncan J.)

[25]                        In advance of the hearing on the production of the on‑board recording before the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, the Board wrote the court, with copies to all the parties to the class action litigation, requesting to make “ex parte representations to the [c]ourt with respect to the contents of the CVR” (A.R., at p. 1511). It argued that the reference to “in camera” in s. 28(6)(b) of the Act meant that the Board should have a reasonable opportunity to make submissions relating to disclosure both in camera and ex parte. In other words, the Board should be able to make representations as to the admissibility of the CVR in the absence both of the public and of the other parties and interveners. The Board said it intended to make submissions on two points: first, on the CVR’s contents and the availability of alternative sources for the information it contained and, second, on certain technical aspects of the CVR in order to help the court understand the materials. Speaking to either of these matters in open court would, said the Board, reveal confidential information and undermine the very protection Parliament intended when it put the privilege in place.

[26]                        In reasons rendered orally, the chambers judge refused the Board’s request to make further submissions in the absence of the other parties. After listening to the CVR in private and considering the evidence and the open court submissions of all counsel, including those of the Board, he found that he had no difficulty understanding the materials and how they related to the pleadings on the determination of liability in the principal action. In the circumstances, the further submissions the Board sought to make were therefore not needed, and accordingly, it was unnecessary to resolve the question of whether the Act permitted the Board to make representations in the absence of the public and the parties.

[27]                        The chambers judge also announced his decision to grant the motion for production of the CVR, with written reasons to follow. In the interval, counsel on all sides could make submissions as to whether it would be appropriate, out of an “abundance of caution and having regard to the statutory privilege”, to redact or otherwise limit the publication of the written reasons to ensure compliance with the confidentiality requirements under the Act (A.R., at pp. 9‑10).

(2)         Reasons for Decision, 2019 NSSC 339, 45 C.P.C. (8th) 124 (Duncan J.)

[28]                        In his written reasons ordering the Board to produce the CVR and transcripts, the chambers judge concluded that the recording contained information that was reliable, relevant and material to the determination of causation, an issue that was central to civil liability in the class action (paras. 29, 31 and 50). Specifically, he wrote that the flying officers’ perceptions and decision‑making in electing to land how and where they did was “central to the action of the plaintiffs” (para. 23). He found that the pilots could not remember many key details of the events leading up to the accident. The discovery evidence of these two flight officers was “necessary to answering important questions” and, since the pilots themselves could not fill the evidentiary gaps, the CVR represented the “only way” to get that information (para. 48). The chambers judge was satisfied that the CVR had important evidentiary value and was “necessary” to resolve the litigation (para. 49).

[29]                        The chambers judge relied on the law as stated by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Société Air France v. Greater Toronto Airports Authority (2009), 85 C.P.C. (6th) 334, aff’d on this point 2010 ONCA 598, 324 D.L.R. (4th) 567, in which Strathy J. (as he then was) examined the history and purpose of s. 28 of the Act and ordered the production of an on‑board recording. In particular, the chambers judge agreed with Strathy J. that the public interest in the administration of justice protects the ability of the parties to make out their case and meet the case against them and preserves the integrity of the judicial fact‑finding process (para. 51). These concerns apply to the current circumstances because “there are issues of trial fairness and fulfillment of the objectives of class proceedings present” (para. 52).

[30]                        He also relied on Air France for the conclusion that the purposes of the statutory privilege are to protect pilot privacy and to protect public safety by encouraging free and uninhibited communications between the pilots (para. 54). The chambers judge held that the pilot privacy and public safety interests in this case were similar to those in Air France, but he did note two factual differences. First, although there were gaps in the pilots’ evidence, the CVR was not used to refresh their memories, unlike in Air France. Second, the pilots in this case opposed the motion for disclosure, while in Air France the pilots did not object to the CVR’s release. Given the gaps in the evidence here and the fact that the pilots had been unable to provide important information, the CVR “has the potential to assist the trier of fact in its truth‑seeking function” (para. 57).

[31]                        The chambers judge balanced the two interests referred to under s. 28(6)(c) and found that the importance of the recording to the administration of justice in the class action outweighed the importance of the statutory privilege. The release of the CVR was necessary to resolve the civil dispute. Disclosure would not interfere with aviation safety, damage relations between pilots and their employers, or impede the investigation of accidents. Moreover, the CVR did not contain private or scandalous material (paras. 63‑68).

[32]                        The chambers judge directed the Board to produce a copy of the CVR and transcript to counsel for use in the class action “under . . . very stringent conditions”, specifying that disclosure would be limited to the parties and their experts, consultants, insurers and lawyers in order to preserve confidentiality (paras. 68‑69).

B.            Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, 2021 NSCA 34, 70 C.P.C. (8th) 142 (Bryson, Derrick and Beaton JJ.A.)

[33]                        The Board was granted leave to appeal from the interlocutory judgment ordering disclosure. It argued that the chambers judge erred in law by failing to allow the Board to make ex parte submissions prior to his decision authorizing disclosure of the CVR. Further, the chambers judge erred in interpreting s. 28(6)(c) when he held that the public’s interest in the proper administration of justice outweighed the importance of the statutory privilege associated with the CVR.

[34]                        On the first issue, Bryson J.A., writing for the court, observed that “in camera” and “ex parte” have different meanings. The term “ex parte” means “in the absence of other parties to litigation” as opposed to the exclusion of the public. Section 28(6)(b) only refers to “in camera”. He considered the English version of s. 28(6)(b) and the relevant portion of the French version of s. 28(6) before concluding that the provision created no ambiguity. Plainly read, the Act authorizes the court, not the parties, to listen to the CVR in camera. The Board, which is not a party in the ordinary sense, is then given an opportunity to make representations, but it is not entitled to do so either in camera or ex parte.

[35]                        On the facts of the case, the Board had not demonstrated that ex parte submissions would have had any impact on the court’s analysis. Moreover, the chambers judge found that he did not need any assistance in understanding the recording. If there were alternative sources for the information contained in the CVR that could address the gaps identified by Airbus, the Board failed to identify them.

[36]                        On the second issue, Bryson J.A. concluded that the chambers judge did not err by ordering disclosure. The chambers judge did not apply the wrong test by relying on Strathy J.’s reasons in Air France rather than Wappen-Reederei GmbH & Co. KG v. Hyde Park (The), 2006 FC 150, [2006] 4 F.C.R. 272. The criteria in Hyde Park are largely subsumed in the Air France analysis. As for a “possibility of a miscarriage of justice”, alluded to in Hyde Park (at para. 74) as a threshold requirement for admitting the CVR, this criterion is not mentioned in the Act and was not retained in Air France. A term more commonly associated with criminal law, a “miscarriage of justice” is a retrospective test that is ill‑suited to the prospective analysis for balancing under s. 28(6)(c). As a bar, it is too high. In any event, the recordings in Hyde Park were not “crucial” and the information contained in them would have been available from other sources. The chambers judge found otherwise here. Hyde Park is thus distinguishable on its facts (para. 60).

[37]                        Bryson J.A. was satisfied that the chambers judge did not “emasculat[e]” the statutory privilege by reducing the balancing test in s. 28(6)(c) to one of simple relevance (para. 85). Instead, the chambers judge found that the information contained in the flight crew’s communications was relevant to causation, was necessary for answering important questions central to the dispute, and could be obtained only through the CVR (para. 67, citing paras. 48 and 50 of the N.S.S.C. reasons). The chambers judge weighed the public interest in the administration of justice against the purpose of the privilege and concluded, after reviewing all the evidence, that disclosure was warranted. The Board identified no legal error or clear and material error in his consideration of the evidence. The discretionary decision of the chambers judge to order disclosure of the CVR was thus entitled to deference.

IV.         Issues

[38]                        There are two issues on appeal. First, is the Board entitled to make submissions in the absence of other parties and the public pursuant to s. 28(6)(b) of the Act? Second, did the chambers judge commit a reviewable error when he ordered the disclosure of the CVR pursuant to s. 28(6)(c)?

[39]                        Insofar as the Board alleges that the chambers judge erred in his interpretation of s. 28(6)(b) by denying it the right to make submissions in the absence of the public and the parties, the first question engages a question of law reviewable on a standard of correctness. If, however, the chambers judge had the discretionary authority to invite or to refuse such submissions, his choice is deserving of deference on appeal.

[40]                        The parties disagree on the standard of review for the second issue. The Board argues that the standard is correctness, as it relates to whether the chambers judge applied the correct legal test. Some of the respondents disagree. They say that the Board is, instead, asking this Court to reweigh the factors and to revisit findings of fact, which are entitled to deference.

[41]                        The disagreement is more apparent than real. A discretionary decision, such as the one contemplated by Parliament in s. 28(6)(c), is generally entitled to deference and may only be interfered with if there is a legal error (considered to be an error in principle), a palpable and overriding factual error (viewed as a material misapprehension of the evidence) or a failure to exercise discretion judicially (which includes acting arbitrarily or being “so clearly wrong as to amount to an injustice”) (Canada (Attorney General) v. Fontaine, 2017 SCC 47, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 205, at para. 36, quoting P. (W.) v. Alberta, 2014 ABCA 404, 378 D.L.R. (4th) 629, at para. 15). An error in the interpretation of s. 28(6)(c) of the Act plainly raises a question of law reviewable on correctness. Thus, if the chambers judge applied the wrong test in weighing the public interest in the administration of justice, or misunderstood the privilege in law by misidentifying its statutory purpose, as the Board alleges, he erred in law (see Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 27; Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc., 1997 CanLII 385 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748, at para. 36). I would add that such an error would preclude affording the deference that is ordinarily given to a judge who undertakes the fundamentally discretionary exercise of weighing interests provided for by the Act. Should it be determined that, due to a misapprehension of the law, the chambers judge put the wrong weights on the scales, his balancing would be inherently flawed. If, on the other hand, the chambers judge correctly identified the factors to be weighed but, in his appreciation of the evidence, assigned different weights than the Board would have wished, the alleged error should be understood as one that attacks the discretionary character of the balancing contemplated by s. 28(6)(c). Absent a palpable and overriding error in his appreciation of the evidence, or proof that the chambers judge did not exercise his discretion under the Act judicially, his decision on the production and admissibility of the CVR deserves deference.

V.           Analysis

[42]                          Before considering whether the chambers judge erred in refusing the Board the opportunity to make submissions on the CVR in the absence of the public and the parties (B) and whether he erred in weighing the interests in play when he chose to set the privilege aside (C), I turn first to an overview of the statutory scheme (A).

A.           The Statutory Scheme

[43]                        Section 28 of the Act is the provision most directly engaged by this appeal. Section 28(2) sets out the statutory privilege, s. 28(6)(b) speaks to the Board’s entitlement to make submissions to the chambers judge and s. 28(6)(c) provides for the discretionary authority to order disclosure of the CVR. Under the heading “Privilege”, s. 28 provides:

Definition of on‑board recording

28 (1) In this section, on-board recording means the whole or any part of

(a) a recording of voice communications originating from, or received on or in,

(i) the flight deck of an aircraft,

(ii) the bridge or a control room of a ship,

(iii) the cab of a locomotive, or

(iv) the control room or pumping station of a pipeline, or

(b) a video recording of the activities of the operating personnel of an aircraft, ship, locomotive or pipeline

that is made, using recording equipment that is intended to not be controlled by the operating personnel, on the flight deck of the aircraft, on the bridge or in a control room of the ship, in the cab of the locomotive or in a place where pipeline operations are carried out, as the case may be, and includes a transcript or substantial summary of such a recording.

 

Privilege for on-board recordings

(2) Every on-board recording is privileged and, except as provided by this section, no person, including any person to whom access is provided under this section, shall

(a) knowingly communicate an on-board recording or permit it to be communicated to any person; or

(b) be required to produce an on-board recording or give evidence relating to it in any legal, disciplinary or other proceedings.

 

Access by Board

(3) Any on-board recording that relates to a transportation occurrence being investigated under this Act shall be released to an investigator who requests it for the purposes of the investigation.

 

Use by Board

(4) The Board may make such use of any on-board recording obtained under this Act as it considers necessary in the interests of transportation safety, but, subject to subsection (5), shall not knowingly communicate or permit to be communicated to anyone any portion thereof that is unrelated to the causes or contributing factors of the transportation occurrence under investigation or to the identification of safety deficiencies.

 

Access by peace officers, coroners and other investigators

(5) The Board shall make available any on-board recording obtained under this Act to

(a) [Repealed, 1998, c. 20, s. 17]

(b) a coroner who requests access thereto for the purpose of an investigation that the coroner is conducting; or

(c) any person carrying out a coordinated investigation under section 18.

 

Power of court or coroner

(6) Notwithstanding anything in this section, where, in any proceedings before a court or coroner, a request for the production and discovery of an on-board recording is made, the court or coroner shall

(a) cause notice of the request to be given to the Board, if the Board is not a party to the proceedings;

(b) in camera, examine the on-board recording and give the Board a reasonable opportunity to make representations with respect thereto; and

(c) if the court or coroner concludes in the circumstances of the case that the public interest in the proper administration of justice outweighs in importance the privilege attached to the on-board recording by virtue of this section, order the production and discovery of the on-board recording, subject to such restrictions or conditions as the court or coroner deems appropriate, and may require any person to give evidence that relates to the on-board recording.

 

Use prohibited

(7) An on-board recording may not be used against any of the following persons in disciplinary proceedings, proceedings relating to the capacity or competence of an officer or employee to perform the officer’s or employee’s functions, or in legal or other proceedings, namely, air or rail traffic controllers, marine traffic regulators, aircraft, train or ship crew members (including, in the case of ships, masters, officers, pilots and ice advisers), airport vehicle operators, flight service station specialists, persons who relay messages respecting air or rail traffic control, marine traffic regulation or related matters and persons who are directly or indirectly involved in the operation of a pipeline.

 

Definition of court

(8) For the purposes of subsection (6), court includes a person or persons appointed or designated to conduct a public inquiry into a transportation occurrence pursuant to this Act or the Inquiries Act.

[44]                        Under the Act, the Board’s object is to advance transportation safety by several designated means. Section 7 sets forth the Board’s mission in service of that object, which includes “conducting independent investigations . . . into selected transportation occurrences in order to make findings as to their causes and contributing factors” and to report publicly on its findings (s. 7(1)(a) and (d)). The Board is also charged with identifying “safety deficiencies” that come to light following accidents and making recommendations designed to eliminate or reduce those deficiencies (s. 7(1)(b) and (c)).

[45]                          In conducting investigations, the Board does not assign fault or determine civil or criminal liability (s. 7(2) to (4)). The purpose of the Board is not to “arrive conclusively at a cause” but instead to “make recommendations with respect to aviation safety” (Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board Act Review Commission, Advancing Safety (1994), at p. 145, quoting Estey report respecting the Arrow Air accident at Gander, Newfoundland, Dec. 12, 1985 (July 21, 1989), at p. 28).

[46]                          Although the Board’s findings cannot be used to establish liability, blame “might be inferred by others from the Board’s findings” (Advancing Safety, at p. 143). The Board need not “concern itself with what outsiders may speculate about who was at fault” when publishing its report as to the causes of an accident (Advancing Safety, at p. 144). Yet Parliament contemplates that the Board’s investigators, its reports, and the evidence it gathers may have information relevant to legal proceedings. Importantly, s. 7(2) explicitly recognizes the possibility of an overlap between the Board’s findings on investigation of an occurrence and matters relating to fault or liability where it states that “the Board shall not refrain from fully reporting on the causes and contributing factors merely because fault or liability might be inferred from the Board’s findings”.

[47]                        The Act puts many of the sources of the Board’s findings on the causes of accidents beyond the reach of litigants, criminal prosecutors and employers. Investigators are not competent or compellable in legal proceedings, except in special circumstances, nor are their opinions admissible in evidence (ss. 32 and 33). Similarly, some of the Board’s investigative sources, notably the CVR and witness statements, are presumptively privileged and can only be disclosed in limited circumstances (ss. 28 and 30). Air traffic control records, while not privileged, cannot be used in designated legal proceedings (s. 29).

[48]                        The rules bearing on aircraft accident investigations were significantly reviewed in the 1980s, following the publication of the Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Aviation Safety in 1981 (“Dubin Report”). After public criticism of an investigation into an aircraft accident in British Columbia, Justice Charles L. Dubin was appointed to chair an inquiry relating to the management of air transportation and to recommend changes to the legislative scheme to improve air safety (Dubin Report, at pp. 1-10).

[49]                        The Dubin Report recommended that on‑board recordings be protected by a new statutory privilege (p. 258). It did so for two reasons. First, CVRs presented the risk of a “unique invasion of [pilot] privacy” (p. 235). The Dubin Report noted that pilots complained “that no other employees are subjected to electronic eavesdropping in their work place” (p. 225). It recognized that pilots have a right to be protected against invasions of privacy except when safety or the administration of justice require otherwise (pp. 235‑36). Second, the Dubin Report documented a widely held conviction amongst accident investigators that “confidentiality is essential to the effectiveness of their work” (p. 147). The Dubin Report recorded concerns that information obtained could be used in litigation to the benefit of the Crown, which might result in investigators being viewed as “partisan” and cause their information sources to dry up (p. 147).

[50]                        While the Dubin Report recognized the important interests supporting some form of confidentiality over such recordings, it also acknowledged that the information contained in these recordings could be relevant for other legal proceedings, including civil actions (see pp. 234‑37). The Dubin Report recommended against granting an absolute privilege over on‑board voice recordings such as CVRs, as that would effectively prevent their use in other proceedings and would “decide, once and for all, against the public interest in the administration of justice” (p. 234). This might deprive an injured person of the only evidence that could establish the cause of, or liability resulting from, an accident (p. 234). As a result, the Dubin Report proposed a middle ground between an absolute statutory privilege and the unlimited accessibility of CVRs under the ordinarily applicable rules for the production of evidence. Recordings should be presumptively privileged and only available for use by the Board in investigations. However, a discretionary power should be established for setting the privilege aside in civil proceedings where the public interest in the administration of justice outweighs the importance of the reasons for the privilege (pp. 236‑37).

[51]                        Soon after the publication of the first volume of the Dubin Report, Parliament enacted the precursor to the present Act, the Canadian Aviation Safety Board Act, S.C. 1980-81-82-83, c. 165 (“CASB Act”), to implement the recommendations. On second reading of the bill, the federal Minister of Transport noted that many of the recommendations in the Dubin Report were adopted and that Parliament had never “gone against what Dubin had recommended” (House of Commons Debates, vol. XXIII, 1st Sess., 32nd Parl., June 28, 1983, at p. 26842). The CASB Act established an independent aviation safety board to investigate aviation accidents (see House of Commons Debates, at p. 26841). In setting down the procedure for investigations, Parliament accepted the Dubin Report’s recommendation to provide a statutory privilege for evidence obtained by Board investigators, including a privilege over CVRs (see Dubin Report, at pp. 258‑61; CASB Act, ss. 26 to 28).

[52]                        Transportation safety was again significantly reformed in 1989 with the introduction of the Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board Act. The Act established a multimodal scheme for oversight of aviation, marine, railway and pipeline occurrences (s. 3). The Act did not significantly change the mechanics of the statutory privilege attached to CVRs and witness statements, although more modes of transportation are now covered by the legislative scheme.

[53]                        The privilege in the Act still largely accords with what was recommended by the Dubin Report. An on‑board recording is privileged and may only be disclosed for use in litigation if, on request, a court or coroner concludes that the public interest favours disclosing the recording. If disclosure and production are ordered, appropriate restrictive conditions may be put in place (s. 28(6)(c)). Significantly, the use of the on‑board recording is prohibited in certain legal settings, for example in proceedings against air traffic controllers (s. 28(7)).

[54]                        The use of evidence gathered by accident investigators has also been the subject of attention by international bodies charged with aviation safety. The international sources, while not decisive for the interpretation of s. 28(6), generally align with the recommendations in the Dubin Report. Section 16 of the Act requires the Board to “take all reasonable measures” to ensure that its investigation practices are consistent with international agreements and conventions to which Canada is a party. This underscores Parliament’s intention that the Act conform to Canada’s international obligations. Annex 13 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, Can. T.S. 1944 No. 36 (“Chicago Convention”), ratified by Canada, provides that certain accident investigation records (including CVRs) should not be made available for purposes other than investigation unless, following an exercise of balancing interests, “their disclosure or use outweighs the likely adverse domestic and international impact such action may have on that or any future investigations” (International Civil Aviation Organization, Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation: Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation (12th ed. 2020), at p. 5-5, standard 5.12). Further, Appendix 2 of Annex 13 recognizes that disclosure of such records in proceedings or to the public “can have adverse consequences for persons or organizations involved in accidents and incidents, likely causing them or others to be reluctant to cooperate with accident investigation authorities in the future” (p. APP 2-1). Further, CVRs and other recordings “may be perceived as constituting an invasion of the privacy of operational personnel if disclosed or used for purposes other than those for which the recordings were made” (p. APP 2-2).

[55]                        These materials confirm the purposes of the statutory privilege. First, it protects pilot privacy by preventing access to the CVR except when requested by investigators. Second, it protects transportation safety by “encourag[ing] full, accurate, and objective communication between flight crew members” and by protecting potential witnesses who may otherwise decline to provide statements to the Board out of fear of repercussions (see Laporte Affidavit, A.R., at pp. 1871-72, paras. 83‑85). Importantly, the privilege is not absolute. Parliament contemplated that it may be set aside when warranted in the interests of justice on a discretionary basis and charged courts and coroners with making that decision. Even when on-board recordings are disclosed, they may be subject to restrictions as deemed appropriate by the court or coroner. And, as noted, their use is prohibited outright in some legal proceedings.

B.            Can the Board Make Submissions Without the Other Parties or the Public Present?

[56]                        Before presenting arguments as to whether production was properly ordered in this case, the Board raises a preliminary issue about the nature of its entitlement to make submissions to the chambers judge. As the Board observes, Parliament has provided it with “heightened participatory rights” in proceedings where disclosure of an on‑board recording is sought, including the right to receive notice of a proceeding (s. 28(6)(a) and (b); A.F., at para. 40). It recalls that even when it is not a party to proceedings, such as the class action in this case, s. 28(6)(b) requires that it be given a reasonable opportunity to make representations with respect to an on‑board recording where a request for disclosure has been made before a court or coroner.

[57]                        Section 28(6)(b) provides that when a request for production and discovery of an on‑board recording is made, the court or coroner shall “in camera, examine the on‑board recording and give the Board a reasonable opportunity to make representations with respect thereto” (in French, s. 28(6) provides: “examine celui-ci à huis clos et donne au Bureau la possibilité de présenter des observations à ce sujet”). The Board argues that a contextual and purposive interpretation of s. 28(6)(b) confirms that Parliament’s intent in enacting this rule was to allow the Board to make submissions with respect to the CVR in the absence of the public and of the other parties. Both courts below are said to have misinterpreted the text as only permitting the Board to make submissions in open court, following a review of the CVR by the judge in private. The Board says that this does not take proper account of the purpose of the Act to advance transportation safety and fails to consider the object of the Board in service of that goal. Because the Board is the only actor who can meaningfully assist the court with the CVR’s contents, it should have the right to make submissions in private and in the absence of the other parties. By concluding otherwise, the courts below have left the Board in the “untenable position” of either undermining the privilege by making submissions in open court or refraining from making proper submissions on the contents altogether (A.F., at para. 34).

[58]                        The Board also says its reading of s. 28(6)(b) aligns with the plain meaning of the provision. Relying principally on the English version of the Act, the Board says the expression “in camera”, followed by a comma, qualifies all the words of para. (b) of s. 28(6). Thus, “in camera” applies both to the examination of the CVR by the decision‑maker and to the Board’s submissions. Moreover, the Board argues that, in this context, “in camera” means not just in the absence of the public but in the absence of the other parties. In this regard, the Board acknowledges that it has changed the position that it took before the courts below where it expressly sought to make “ex parte” submissions before the chambers judge (A.R., at pp. 1511 and 1518). It now says that ex parte means “without notice” and that the sense of “in the absence of the parties” is, in this context, properly conveyed by the term “in camera” in s. 28(6)(b) (A.F., at para. 42).

[59]                        For the respondents, the Board’s arguments are not supported by the text, purpose or context of s. 28(6)(b) or by its legislative history. Not only is the term “ex parte” not used, the words “in camera” (or “à huis clos” in the French text of s. 28(6)(b)) only refer to the judge listening to the recording at the step prior to the weighing of interests. The terms do not apply to the setting in which the Board makes its submissions. They argue that the Board is ostensibly seeking to make ex parte submissions, as it argued in the courts below, in the sense often given to that term, i.e. “without the other parties”. This is different than the meaning this Court gave to in camera in C.B. v. The Queen, 1981 CanLII 213 (SCC), [1981] 2 S.C.R. 480, at p. 493, quoting Jowitt’s Dictionary of English Law (2nd ed. 1977): “. . . when the judge either hears it in his private room, or causes the doors of the court to be closed and all persons, except those concerned in the case, to be excluded”.

[60]                        The respondents contend that this is confirmed by the plain meaning of the French text. There, the term “à huis clos” is used, which conforms to the ordinary meaning of “in camera” in the English text, and it is not followed by a comma. Insofar as there may be a discordance between the two linguistic texts, the French should be preferred as it is both unambiguous and reflects the shared meaning. The Attorney General of Canada adds that the legislative history of the provision does not support the right to make in camera and ex parte submissions. Airbus argues that it is a rule of natural justice that a party be heard and be able to hear the other side in open court. This principle may only be set aside when there is statutory authority or inherent jurisdiction to do so.

[61]                        I agree with the respondents that the reference to “in camera” and “à huis clos” in s. 28(6) only applies to a court or coroner’s examination of the recording and not to the Board’s reasonable opportunity to make submissions. Section 28(6)(b) is silent on the specifics of the manner and form by which the Board should make its submissions. Here, s. 28(6)(b) neither grants the Board the right to make submissions in the absence of the public or the other parties nor does it preclude the court or coroner from asking for them should they be necessary to decide the issue.

[62]                        First, the Board’s argument that s. 28(6)(b) gives it a general entitlement to make submissions “in the absence of the other parties” cannot succeed (A.F., at para. 5). The request to make submissions in the absence of other parties is not in substance, as the Board argues, “a request to make submissions in camera” (A.F., at para. 45). It is, instead, a request to make submissions both in camera and effectively ex parte, in the sense of [translation] “without a party” (A. Mayrand, Dictionnaire de maximes et locutions latines utilisées en droit (4th ed. 2007), at p. 168). An in camera hearing is one held in the absence of the public, either in the judge’s private chambers or in a courtroom (C.B., at p. 493; Mayrand, at p. 214). This ordinary, legal meaning of an “in camera” hearing is, barring clear indication to the contrary, to be preferred. As Cromwell J. wrote in R. v. D.L.W., 2016 SCC 22, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 402, “[w]hen Parliament uses a term with a legal meaning, it intends the term to be given that meaning” (para. 20). Proceedings held in the absence of other parties are not in camera proceedings and are often held in open court (see Ruby v. Canada (Solicitor General), 2002 SCC 75, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 25-26, speaking to ex parte proceedings taken “without notice to or argument by any adverse party”).

[63]                        The Board argues that it is not, strictly speaking, seeking an opportunity to make ex parte submissions because ex parte proceedings are conducted without notice to adverse parties. It says that it does not seek to proceed without notice to the other parties, but instead simply to make submissions in their absence, with notice.

[64]                        The term “ex parte” is often defined as a proceeding undertaken without notice to an adverse party (see, e.g., Ruby, at para. 25; Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada v. 960122 Ontario Ltd., 2003 FCA 256, 26 C.P.R. (4th) 161, at para. 29; Hover v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 1999 ABCA 123, 91 Alta. L.R. (3d) 226, at para. 22; see also Nova Scotia Civil Procedure Rules, r. 23.14(1)(b) (the moving party on an ex parte motion must explain “why it is appropriate for the judge to grant the order without notice to another person”)). But even on this understanding of the term, I disagree with the Board that providing notice to adverse parties converts what would otherwise be a hearing held in the absence of the parties into one held in camera. Properly understood, “in camera” refers to the exclusion of the public from a proceeding, not the exclusion of parties. A proceeding in which an adverse party is aware of the hearing but is prevented from making submissions is not an in camera proceeding (see, e.g., R. v. Basi, 2009 SCC 52, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 389).

[65]                        Second, I agree with the respondents that the words “in camera” in the English text, like the equivalent expression “à huis clos” in the French text of s. 28(6), only refer to the judge’s examination of the recording and not to the Board’s ability to make submissions.

[66]                        The legislative history supports the respondents’ interpretation of s. 28(6)(b). The predecessor to the Act as it appeared in the 1985 Revised Statutes of Canada, the Canadian Aviation Safety Board Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑12, contained a provision similar to s. 28(6)(b), but stated slightly differently. In s. 34(1) of the Canadian Aviation Safety Board Act, the decision‑maker was required to,

(b) in camera, examine the cockpit voice recording, and

(c) give the Board a reasonable opportunity to make representations with respect thereto . . . .

These requirements were separated into two paragraphs, thereby indicating that “in camera” in the English text only applied to the decision‑maker’s examination of the recording and not to the Board’s representations. The English text of the present s. 28(6)(b) of the Act maintains the use of subparagraphs but combines paras. (b) and (c) of s. 34(1). The comma following “in camera” in the English text remains in place.

[67]                        It is true that there is a presumption that legislative changes are to be viewed as purposive. However, this presumption can be displaced where the change to the law was not so intended (see R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at § 23.02; P.-A. Côté and M. Devinat, Interprétation des lois (5th ed. 2021), at paras. 1470 and 1767). This is, in my respectful view, just such a case. In a clause‑by‑clause overview of the present Act prepared when the bill was introduced, Transport Canada observed that s. 28(6) “allows a court or coroner in any proceedings to examine in camera an on‑board recording” (Bill C-2: Transportation Accident Investigation Board — Clause by Clause, at p. 33, reproduced in the Attorney General of Canada’s book of authorities, at p. 76). Transport Canada noted that the new bill contained the “[s]ame privileged conditions for information as in [the] CASB [Act]” (TAIB Act — C-2: Overview of Bill, reproduced in the Attorney General of Canada’s book of authorities, at p. 68). I agree with the Attorney General of Canada that the history of s. 28(6) suggests that the amendments did not change the underlying meaning of the section from the law as it was stated in s. 34(1) of the Revised Statutes version it replaced. Parliament did not seek to extend to the Board an opportunity to make submissions in the absence of the other parties when it made largely formal changes to s. 28(6). Rather, the legislative history demonstrates Parliament’s continuous intention that the words “in camera” in the English version of the text apply only to the court or coroner’s review of the on‑board recording.

[68]                          I also reject the Board’s argument that s. 28(6)(b) is ambiguous based on a discordance between the English and French texts. The two texts should be read together, as befits the interpretation of federal statutes given that they are equally authoritative expressions of Parliamentary intention (see, e.g., Reference re Manitoba Language Rights, 1985 CanLII 33 (SCC), [1985] 1 S.C.R. 721; M. Doucet, “Le bilinguisme législatif”, in M. Bastarache and M. Doucet, eds., Les droits linguistiques au Canada (3rd ed. 2013), 179, at pp. 224‑25). While Parliament presented the French text in a single subsection rather than in separate paragraphs, neither text uses terminology that would suggest that the Board’s submissions should be made in the absence of the other parties. It is clear that the words “in camera” and “à huis clos” speak to the decision‑maker’s examination of the on‑board recording in the absence of the public and not the Board’s opportunity to make submissions in the absence of the other parties. I disagree with the view that the presence of a comma following the term “in camera” in the English text, which is absent from the French, creates a consequential discordance of meaning. To my mind, both “in camera” and “à huis clos” refer to the same idea. The comma in the English text does not suggest that the English text, unlike the French, is “reasonably capable” of meaning something different, namely that the Board’s submissions are to be made in the absence of the other parties (see R. v. Daoust, 2004 SCC 6, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 217, at para. 28, quoting Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 29).

[69]                          The Board is right that the comma in the English text of s. 28(6)(b) cannot be ignored in the interpretation of the Act. Punctuation is “an integral part of the legislative text, to be taken into account in every case” (Sullivan, at § 14.07). However, while comma placement may sometimes assist in discerning the scope of qualifying phrases, Professor Ruth Sullivan observes that Canadian courts are “unwilling to place much reliance on [punctuation] as an aid to interpretation” due to its “inherent unreliability”. She writes that “[m]any of the conventions governing punctuation, especially comma placement, are fluid and unstable.” Professor Sullivan recalls the comments of L’Heureux‑Dubé J. in Laurentide Motels Ltd. v. Beauport (City), 1989 CanLII 81 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 705, at p. 755: “A debate on punctuation cannot take the place of an interpretation based on the legislative context and ordinary meaning of words. The reliability of punctuation as a tool of interpretation has indeed been questioned . . .” (§ 14.07).

[70]                          Professors Pierre-André Côté and Mathieu Devinat are of a comparable view. They write that punctuation is part of a statute and say that commas can serve in interpretation (para. 260). But like Professor Sullivan, they note the [translation] “unreliability” of punctuation as an instrument of communication and cite examples in which courts rely on other indicia of statutory meaning “to reject arguments based on punctuation”, including what they call the “misplaced comma” (para. 262).

[71]                          The comma in the English text of s. 28(6)(b) cannot therefore be ignored, but neither can the absence of its grammatical equivalent in the French text. The legislative history of the English text of s. 28(6)(b), canvassed above, suggests that this punctuation may well be, as Professors Côté and Devinat say, a [translation] “misplaced comma”. Moreover whatever import, in a literal sense, one might be inclined to give to the comma, it does not change the sense of in camera from “1. privately; not in public. 2. Law in a judge’s private room” (Canadian Oxford Dictionary (1998), at p. 204) to “without notice to or in the absence of the other parties”, which is confirmed by its pairing with “à huis clos”. The French phrase “à huis clos” means [translation] “[1.] with all doors closed. [2.] Law. Without the public being admitted” (Le Grand Robert de la langue française (2nd ed. 2001), vol. 3, at p. 1935). Paradoxically, the Board seems to ask us to read the comma literally, so that it governs the interpretation of s. 28(6)(b), but, at the same time, read the consecrated expression “in camera” in a non‑literal sense.

[72]                          Finally on this point, even if the comma following “in camera” created a true disparity between the French and English texts, their shared meaning aligns with the unambiguous French text here (see, e.g., R. v. Mac, 2002 SCC 24, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 856, at para. 6; Daoust, at paras. 29 and 44). Where, as here, one linguistic version is ambiguous and the other is unequivocal, the shared meaning that should be preferred, a priori, is the meaning of the version that is free from ambiguity (Côté and Devinat, at para. 1130). Moreover, the French text would be preferred on the basis that it has a narrower meaning (Medovarski v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 SCC 51, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 539, at para. 25; Côté and Devinat, at para. 1131).

[73]                          The phrase “à huis clos” follows “examine celui-ci” and comes before the balance of the sentence, which speaks to the Board’s opportunity to make submissions, separated by the word “et”. The French text thus clearly indicates that the court or coroner examines the recording in private and the court or coroner then provides the opportunity to make submissions. The French text plainly and unambiguously indicates that it is the court or the coroner — not the parties or the Board — who is authorized to listen to the recording in camera. As counsel for Airbus submitted, to respect the presumptive confidentiality of the recording at this stage, the decision‑maker must listen to it in the absence of the parties (s. 28(2); transcript, at p. 80). Thereafter, submissions, including those of the Board, are made in open court (C.A. reasons, at para. 42). In short, insofar as the comma in the English text of s. 28(6)(b) creates an ambiguity, it would be resolved by the plainer and narrower meaning of the French text (see, e.g., R. v. S.A.C., 2008 SCC 47, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 675, at para. 15).

[74]                          Isolating the shared meaning is, of course, only an indication of legislative intent. In some circumstances, that indication might be revealed to be imperfect by other valid methods of interpretation (see, e.g., Doré v. Verdun (City), 1997 CanLII 315 (SCC), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 862, at para. 25; Côté and Devinat, at para. 1141). The Board argues here that whatever the shared meaning, the purpose of the Act is compatible with the English version which, in its view, grounds its entitlement to make submissions in the absence of the other parties. I agree with the Board that one of the purposes of the Act is to advance transportation safety and that the Board has a duty, to that end, to defend the privilege. This justifies, as I have noted, a heightened role for the Board in litigation such as the class action here where it would otherwise be a stranger to the dispute. But while the Board’s statutory mission justifies giving it a reasonable opportunity to make submissions, it does not give it the extraordinary right to make those submissions in the absence of the public and of the other parties. To be sure, the Board has a duty to protect the privilege over the CVR. But, it should be recalled, Parliament did not intend for the CVR to be protected by an absolute privilege, but rather by a discretionary one. It makes sense to interpret the rule on the Board’s entitlement to make submissions in light of the balance that Parliament sought to strike between the public interests at stake. And, of course, the Board is not deprived of the opportunity to make submissions inter partes, in which setting it can make representations concerning pilot privacy and public safety. As I note below, the Board would also be able to argue that the court or coroner needs its assistance, in the form of private submissions, to understand the CVR.

[75]                        While s. 28(6)(b) does not therefore provide the Board with a general entitlement to make submissions in the absence of the public and the other parties, can the decision‑maker faced with a disclosure request nevertheless invite such submissions if they would be useful? The purpose and scheme of the Act suggest that, notwithstanding the absence of a general rule allowing for such submissions, there must be a way for the Board to make representations about the content of a recording without defeating the privilege entirely. Parliament chose to give the Board heightened participatory rights when production of an on‑board recording is requested (s. 28(6)(a) and (b)). It would be absurd for Parliament to create such rights but also prevent the court or coroner tasked with reviewing the recording from doing so without defeating the privilege. Thus, the answer to the question of whether a decision‑maker can request, where it perceives the necessity, submissions from the Board in the absence of the public and of the parties, notwithstanding the statute’s silence on the issue, must be yes.

[76]                        To facilitate the proper adjudication of the request for production and discovery of the presumptively privileged recording, the court or coroner must, as a first step, examine the recording in private (s. 28(6)(b)). The Board must also be afforded a “reasonable opportunity” to make submissions, in the presence of the other parties who have no access to the on‑board recording, in relation to the privilege. When the Board is making submissions, the privilege established in s. 28(2) still governs and the Board still has a statutory duty to safeguard the contents of the CVR.

[77]                        In particular, as the Board notes, there may be instances in which the court or coroner does not understand the technical contents of the recording that it has examined in camera. The Board will already have reviewed the recording and, of course, has the expertise to elucidate its technical aspect. There may be other narrow instances in which, after exploring alternatives, the Board shows that adverting to the contents of the recording is both necessary and unavoidable for its submissions on production.

[78]                        In such circumstances, the court or coroner must have an ability to seek assistance from the Board without defeating the privilege. In other words, the decision‑maker must have an ability to ask for submissions from the technically expert Board, in the absence of other parties and the public, “before the question of . . . disclosure is decided [as that] might well render the whole process utterly useless and frustrate the end result of the proceedings” (Hunter v. Canada (Consumer and Corporate Affairs), 1991 CanLII 8251 (FCA), [1991] 3 F.C. 186 (C.A.), at p. 202). Indeed, it would be absurd to read the statute in a way that precludes a court or coroner from receiving the Board’s submissions with other parties and the public excluded if such submissions cannot otherwise be made without defeating the privilege. To read the Act in such a way as to preclude the very work that s. 28 asks the court to undertake would have the effect of undermining Parliament’s plain intent at this stage of the proceedings.

[79]                        Despite the statute’s silence on this issue, the authority to receive submissions from the Board in the absence of other parties and the public may be “practically necessary” to accomplish the goal of the section (see ATCO Gas and Pipelines Ltd. v. Alberta (Energy and Utilities Board), 2006 SCC 4, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 140, at para. 51; Sullivan, at ch. 12). As a result, the authority to receive submissions from the Board in the absence of the public and of the other parties, including on technical matters, must be necessarily implicit in the statutory scheme. It is not an entitlement of the Board, but the Act does not preclude the decision‑maker from calling for or obtaining such assistance, when otherwise unavoidable. The Act does not, and logically cannot, preclude the decision‑maker from seeking this assistance where it is necessary to decide on the motion for disclosure. In this case, it suffices to say that the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia had the discretion to hear additional submissions from the Board on the contents of the CVR privately and in the absence of other parties.

[80]                        To be clear, the general rule is that the Board should make the submissions contemplated in s. 28(6)(b) in open court and in the presence of other parties. Exceptionally, should the decision-maker determine that assistance from the Board is needed in order to decide on the motion for disclosure, the decision-maker may permit or ask the Board to make further submissions in the absence of the public, in the absence of other parties, or both, so that the recording can be properly reviewed without defeating the privilege. Should the Board seek to make such submissions, the request may be allowed, if the decision‑maker concludes that excluding other parties and restricting court openness is necessary and unavoidable in order to protect the privilege. Such submissions should be done in a manner that would be fair to all parties, by providing them with notice.

[81]                        In this case, the chambers judge concluded that he was not prepared to receive submissions from the Board in the absence of the other parties. He noted that he “had no difficulty in understanding the privileged materials and how they relate to the pleadings”, including the determination of liability in the class action (A.R., at p. 8). He decided that, having regard to the evidence and submissions already received, as well as the questions that must be answered to determine the motion, it was not appropriate or necessary to receive such submissions (A.R., at pp. 8‑9).

[82]                        Before our Court, the Board argued that the chambers judge erred in refusing to hear these further submissions. The Board said that it could have provided the chambers judge with a chart containing alternative non‑privileged sources for the privileged information on the CVR. This, it said, would have assisted the judge in determining whether the information on the CVR could be obtained from non‑privileged sources.

[83]                        I am not satisfied that it was necessary for the Board to make such submissions in this case. The chambers judge found that the parties could not obtain information from non‑privileged sources. This finding was made on the strength of a chart provided by one of the defendants, which detailed gaps in the discovery evidence of the Captain and First Officer related to details of the flight that they could not remember and compared those gaps with excerpts from the Board’s report. The information detailed in the report, which was gathered from many sources, including the CVR, suggested that some of the gaps could be filled using data contained on the CVR.

[84]                        The Board was more than capable of refuting this chart by showing that all the information contained in it could have been obtained from non‑privileged sources, without disclosing the contents of the CVR or defeating the statutory privilege. Indeed, that is exactly what the Board attempted to do. The chambers judge found that, although the Board had shown that some of the evidentiary gaps could be filled with other evidence, the CVR was the only way to obtain important information to fill gaps in the flight crew’s testimony (para. 48). The Board has not provided any basis to conclude that this finding was in error.

[85]                        As a result, I agree with Bryson J.A. that the chambers judge made no reviewable error in not allowing the Board to make the submissions it requested. This was a discretionary decision that is entitled to deference.

C.            The Test for Production Under Section 28(6)(c)

[86]                        Following the recommendation of the Dubin Report, Parliament enacted a balancing test for the production of on‑board recordings. The privilege would be discretionary rather than absolute, similar to some, but not all, statutory privileges (Dubin Report, at pp. 258‑59). As noted, the approach adopted by Parliament aligns with the Chicago Convention, which similarly proposes a balancing test for disclosure of accident records, like CVRs, for use outside of accident investigation (Annex 13, at pp. 5-5 and 5-6, standard 5.12). Under s. 28(6)(c), an on‑board recording must only be disclosed for production and discovery if, upon request, a court or coroner is satisfied that the “public interest in the proper administration of justice outweighs in importance the privilege attached to the on‑board recording by virtue of this section”. Notably, the public interest informs both sides of the balance: the public has an interest in the proper administration of justice as it does in ensuring transportation safety.

[87]                        The statutory privilege in this case, like with all privileges, “block[s] the flow of potentially relevant and even highly reliable and important information into the truth‑finding mechanism of the trial” (S. C. Hill, D. M. Tanovich and L. P. Strezos, McWilliams’ Canadian Criminal Evidence (5th ed. (loose-leaf)), at § 14:1). A statutory privilege thus can exclude relevant evidence, preferring other values or interests designated by the legislature as superior. The author Fournier has observed that [translation] “these values or interests protected by privileges are generally external to the objectives of the judicial system . . . . [A] privilege under the law of evidence represents a limit on the search for truth by courts or parties” (pp. 471 and 474). In the case of the privilege over the CVR, s. 28 of the Act recognizes that the Parliamentary goals of safeguarding pilot privacy and advancing transportation safety can justify, in some circumstances, the non‑disclosure of the on‑board recording notwithstanding its potential relevance to the search for truth at trial. The balancing model used by Parliament in s. 28(6)(c) directs that non-disclosure applies by default; it falls to the party seeking production to explain why the privilege should not apply, as an exception to the default rule (see, e.g., R. v. Gruenke, 1991 CanLII 40 (SCC), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 263, at p. 286). To that extent, Parliament has indicated a preference for non‑disclosure insofar as the CVR is presumptively privileged. That presumption can, however, be rebutted by the party seeking disclosure. The test for production under s. 28(6)(c) invites the court or coroner to undertake a discretionary balancing of the interests at stake, in a manner similar to the test used for case‑by‑case privileges (Lizotte v. Aviva Insurance Company of Canada, 2016 SCC 52, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 521, at para. 32; R. v. National Post, 2010 SCC 16, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 477, at paras. 53 and 58). Unlike some other statutory privileges, the privilege in s. 28(6)(c) is thus a discretionary one rather than an absolute privilege, with or without exceptions (see, e.g., Babcock v. Canada (Attorney General), 2002 SCC 57, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 17 and 23).

[88]                        As a point of comparison, it is useful to refer to the statutory privilege bearing on journalistic sources set out in s. 39.1 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5 (“CEA”), which is similar in substance to s. 28 of the Act. Before the enactment of s. 39.1 of the CEA, the confidentiality of journalistic sources was protected on a case‑by‑case basis: it was a journalist’s burden to show that the disclosure of information might reveal the identity of a source (National Post, at paras. 50‑69; Globe and Mail v. Canada (Attorney General), 2010 SCC 41, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 592, at para. 22). The legislative scheme in s. 39.1 enhanced protection for journalistic sources by shifting the burden of proof: once the court is satisfied that the definitions of “journalist” and “journalistic source” are met, non‑disclosure is the starting point. It is up to the party seeking to obtain the information to rebut this presumption by demonstrating that, following a balancing exercise, the public interest in the administration of justice outweighs the public interest in protecting the source (see CEA, s. 39.1(7); Denis v. Côté, 2019 SCC 44, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 482, at paras. 33‑34; Fournier, at p. 490). Section 28 of the Act invites a comparable analysis here. As noted in the Dubin Report, prior to the enactment of the Act, a privilege over CVRs would have been asserted either under Crown privilege or on a case‑by‑case basis (pp. 231‑32). In either situation, the burden was on the Crown or the party claiming privilege. Like s. 39.1 of the CEA, s. 28(6) reverses the presumption: the burden of proof falls to the party seeking disclosure since, under the Act, the privilege presumptively applies until the party seeking disclosure has shown that the public interest in protecting the CVR from disclosure has been displaced by the public interest in the administration of justice. In this sense, disclosure of a recording is the exception to the rule.

[89]                        The Board advances two types of arguments in its submissions on the application of s. 28(6)(c) to this case. First, it says that the courts below “distorted” the test for balancing required under the section. The inevitable result of the test used by the chambers judge, it says, is to order disclosure whenever relevance is made out. The chambers judge thereby erred in law by failing to apply the correct test for production. This represented a failure to account for Parliament’s intent when it enacted the privilege, specifically a failure to identify properly Parliament’s goals in establishing the privilege. The chambers judge erred, it says, by following the reasoning of Air France, which similarly failed to give weight to the purpose behind the statutory privilege and instead gave too much importance to the reliability of the CVR and its relevance to the class action. Drawing on Hyde Park, it says that the proper test is whether there is a possibility of a miscarriage of justice. Second, the Board says that the judge also failed to attribute the proper weight to Parliament’s purpose, even if the purpose was correctly identified, thereby erring in fact. The Board is supported by the ACPA, which argues that the courts below gave too little weight to the privacy interests that the privilege is meant to protect.

[90]                        The other respondents argue that the chambers judge applied the proper test for production. Airbus contends that the Air France test is consistent with the text of the statute and the Dubin Report recommendations. It also notes that the chambers judge considered all of the factors raised by the Board, including privacy and safety. While the Board may disagree with the weight he assigned to different factors, his findings and exercise of discretion were well supported by the evidence and deserve deference on appeal.

[91]                        I turn now to the test for production, the purposes behind the statutory privilege and the balancing undertaken by the chambers judge under s. 28(6)(c).

(1)         The Public Interest in the Proper Administration of Justice

[92]                        What Parliament has designated as the public interest in the proper administration of justice concerns a party’s right to a fair trial and to present all relevant evidence that is necessary to resolve the dispute (see Dubin Report, at p. 234; International Civil Aviation Organization, Manual on Protection of Safety Information, Part I — Protection of Accident and Incident Investigation Records, Doc. 10053 (1st ed. 2016), s. 3.3.37.1; Hyde Park, at para. 74; Air France, at paras. 121 and 138). At its core, this relates to the question of whether withholding evidence would interfere with the fact‑finding process to such an extent that it would undermine a party’s right to a fair trial and, consequently, public confidence in the administration of justice. But relevancy and trustworthiness are not absolute values; the very existence of the privilege suggests that Parliament is prepared to subordinate the truth‑finding function of a civil trial to what it sees as potentially higher values.

[93]                        It follows, then, that in assessing the public interest in the proper administration of justice, a decision‑maker must consider the CVR’s relevance, its probative value, and its necessity to the proceedings, including whether the evidence is available from other, non‑privileged sources. The more important the contents of the CVR are to establishing or defending an action, the greater the risk that withholding the CVR would threaten trial fairness. If the CVR contains evidence that is relevant and probative but available from other sources, withholding production generally will not interfere with the fact‑finding process or put the administration of justice at risk. The burden is on the moving party to establish that the CVR may contain relevant, probative but also necessary evidence, in that it is not obtainable elsewhere. Although identifying the necessity component in particular may be challenging without having access to the CVR, the moving party in this instance correctly relied on the Board’s report, which included multiple references to data contained on the CVR, to demonstrate its importance to resolving the underlying dispute.

[94]                        The Board argues that the test in Hyde Park, rather than Air France, ought to be followed because Hyde Park better reflects the balancing required under s. 28(6)(c). It argues that the balancing done in Air France, relied upon by the courts below, “departs from the high threshold for setting aside privilege . . . and debilitates the very privilege enacted by Parliament” (A.F., at para. 55). It says that Air France essentially imposes a simple relevance test to outweigh the privilege in the name of the public interest in the administration of justice, which is too low a bar for disclosure.

[95]                        In response, Airbus argues that the standards proposed by the Board — either a “possibility of a miscarriage of justice” or insufficient evidence to make out a case — do not reflect the correct test, which calls for a weighing exercise. Airbus recalls that the statute does not fix a single factor. Indeed, it requires that a decision‑maker exercise their discretion to balance the public interest in the administration of justice against the privilege attached to the recording.

[96]                        In my view, the Board’s characterizations of both Air France and Hyde Park lack nuance. Contrary to the Board’s assertion, Air France did not reduce the interest in the administration of justice to a consideration of mere relevance. Strathy J. found that the CVR in Air France captured communications that were “central to liability” and that the evidence available from the flight crew was not without concern (paras. 116 and 119‑20).

[97]                        Properly understood, the Hyde Park test does not stand in substantial opposition to Air France. In Hyde Park, Gauthier J. (as she then was) identified a non‑exhaustive list of four factors that would be relevant to assessing whether to set aside the statutory privilege (para. 74). She noted, quite rightly, that the privilege should not be set aside too readily:

As it is the case in respect of other statutory privileges which are subject to a similar balancing exercise, the Court must give appropriate weight to the privilege and avoid routinely allowing disclosure simply because of the probative value normally attached to audio recordings of events. In all cases, the Court must consider among other things:

 

(i) the nature and subject-matter of the litigation;

 

(ii) the nature and probative value of the evidence in the particular case and how necessary this evidence is for the proper determination of a core issue before the Court;

 

(iii) whether there are other ways of getting this information before the Court;

 

(iv) the possibility of a miscarriage of justice. [Emphasis added.]

 

[98]                        Gauthier J. was right that disclosure should not be routinely authorized simply because audio recordings offer reliable or trustworthy evidence. She was also right to highlight, in items (ii), (iii), and (iv) of her list, that necessity is an essential component of the analysis. While some criticism has been visited upon the “possibility of a miscarriage of justice” factor in the courts below and in Air France, in my view, these comments unfairly ignore the inherently prospective “possibility” qualifier. In making this statement, Gauthier J. was not drawing upon the purely criminal law idea of a miscarriage of justice. Instead, I understand her to be saying that the risk of judicial error increases when highly relevant, probative and necessary evidence related to a key issue is withheld from the fact‑finding process. Where evidence is crucial to a central issue in the case, its exclusion on any basis may threaten trial fairness. The more central the evidence, the higher the risk of distorting fact‑finding to the point of civil justice being improperly thwarted. Similarly, on the facts of Air France, Strathy J. concluded that there was a “real risk” that without disclosure, the parties would be deprived of evidence related to the central issue in the case (para. 138). In practice, the factors and balancing articulated in Air France and Hyde Park are not as discordant as the Board suggests.

[99]                        In Air France, Strathy J. also considered the nature of the proceeding, as did the chambers judge here (N.S.S.C. reasons, at paras. 51‑52 and 66; Air France, at para. 127). They both concluded that the public interest in the adjudication of class actions, given their potential for broad‑based behaviour modification, as well as the high monetary value of the claims, pulled in favour of production. While the concern for the fair adjudication of a class action is legitimate, I would respectfully resist the view that it is relevant to balancing here. The public interest in the administration of justice and a fair trial is not materially different in a class action in a manner that affects weighing under s. 28(6)(c). Achieving a “fair and efficient resolution” to a dispute is a goal of all civil proceedings, and there is a public interest in the fair and efficient resolution of all disputes. Isolating class actions as having heightened significance in the weighing exercise could inappropriately upset the balancing process and devalue the importance Parliament has attributed to the privilege.

[100]                     But the chambers judge did not treat this factor as decisive here, nor did Strathy J. in Air France. Strathy J. described it as “another aspect” distinct from that associated with trial fairness (at para. 127), and the chambers judge drew a similar distinction (para. 52). Moreover, in Air France, as in this case, a key consideration was the risk to trial fairness that arises when evidence that is necessary to the resolution of the dispute is blocked by the privilege. Notwithstanding his comments on the importance of behaviour modification by class action, the chambers judge recognized the necessity of the CVR for a fair trial as a matter of negligence law. As he observed, the communication between the flight officers, particularly just before the descent, “is central to liability” (para. 50). His reasoning on the causation issue would not have changed had the representative plaintiffs sought damages for their losses on an individual basis rather than as representatives of a class, nor would this issue have been any less central to liability. The public interest in trial fairness on its own, in both Air France and this case, justified the decision to order disclosure as a necessity to resolve the liability issues at trial. What mattered was the fact that the CVR was necessary to the fair prosecution of the civil action, regardless of whether it was pursued on a class basis. The chambers judge’s comments on class actions have not been shown to have had a material effect on the ultimate decision to order production and discovery and thus do not amount to a fatal error.

[101]                     I note, without commenting further, that the nature of the proceeding may be relevant to the final balancing, in that criminal or disciplinary proceedings may engage different interests (see, e.g., Dubin Report, at pp. 234‑35, which stated that the considerations that apply to criminal and disciplinary cases may differ from civil proceedings). There are also additional procedural protections that limit the use of CVR evidence, including a firm prohibition on the use of CVRs in disciplinary proceedings against pilots or proceedings related to the competency of pilots, in addition to other legal proceedings involving, in particular, air traffic controllers (s. 28(7)). The chambers judge did not lose sight of this, recalling the prohibition in s. 28(7) explicitly in making his order (para. 69).

(2)         The Privilege Attached to the On-Board Recording by Virtue of Section 28

[102]                     The court or coroner must decide if, in the circumstances of the case, the public interest in the proper administration of justice outweighs in importance the privilege attached to the recording by virtue of s. 28. The Board argues that there are two purposes relevant to the importance, for Parliament, of the statutory privilege: first, to protect pilot privacy and second, to protect safety, by reducing adverse impacts on disclosure in future investigations. Privacy and safety were recognized in the Dubin Report and the International Civil Aviation Organization’s recommendations, and I accept that these two principles animate the statutory privilege.

[103]                     Privacy was a primary concern of the Dubin Report. It was a key factor behind the recommendation to provide privilege over on‑board recordings, as the Dubin Report recognized the unique invasion of privacy that a CVR can represent to the flight crew in particular (pp. 233‑37). I generally agree with Strathy J.’s careful analysis of privacy in Air France. First, purely personal conversations between pilots immaterial to resolving the civil dispute ought not to be disclosed, and judicial screening should prevent the disclosure of those conversations (Air France, at paras. 131‑32). Sterile cockpit rules, which prevent discussion of personal matters in the cockpit when the plane is below an altitude of 10,000 feet, will also limit the disclosure of purely personal conversations (see N.S.S.C. reasons, at para. 43).

[104]                     Pilots’ general privacy interest must be considered when determining whether to produce a CVR. Strathy J. concluded, in considering general privacy interests, that the publication of a Board report that discusses the content of the CVR can be a more serious invasion of a pilot’s privacy than the disclosure of the CVR to parties to litigation (Air France, at para. 133).

[105]                     Drawing on a broad range of sources, Strathy J. did recognize that the statutory privilege served an important purpose in supporting pilot privacy and specifically said so at various points in his reasons (see, e.g., paras. 71, 112-13 and 130‑31). His comment that the concern for pilots’ general interest in privacy is “largely illusory” in para. 133, when read in context, is neither a dismissal nor an erroneous discounting of privacy as a purpose protected by s. 28 of the Act. Instead, Strathy J. merely observed that the concern for privacy would already be met because disclosure of purely personal communications, or those made “in agony” prior to a crash, would not be in the public interest. He observed, quite rightly, that “judicial vetting of the CVR”, as well as sterile cockpit rules, would bar non‑operational communications “in any event” (para. 131). Otherwise, he noted, the Board would have already disclosed the substance of communications in many instances when it published its report. In that sense, the pilots’ concern for their privacy was, for Strathy J., one that could properly be accounted for in the balancing regime established in s. 28(6)(c). Importantly, too, Strathy J. rightly recognized that the privacy interests in Air France were diminished, as the airline and the pilots did not oppose disclosure on the facts of that case. Finally, Strathy J. was not wrong to say that pilots are unlikely to prize personal privacy over the safety of their passengers. The decision in Air France did not, in my view, unfairly discount pilot privacy as a legitimate purpose for which the privilege was enacted.

[106]                     On the second purpose of the privilege, the Dubin Report recognized investigators’ concerns that disclosure of investigative materials could have negative consequences for witness cooperation in future cases (see pp. 147 and 231) and that disclosure of CVRs to the public could mean the “cause of aviation safety would be prejudiced” (p. 235). The International Civil Aviation Organization’s Manual on Protection of Safety Information states that when records have been collected for the purpose of conducting an investigation and advancing safety, their disclosure or use for other reasons may “cause persons or organizations to refuse to provide information or be reluctant to cooperate with accident investigation authorities” (s. 3.1.2). Similarly, the affidavit from the Board’s representative, Mr. Laporte, speaks to the importance of the privilege in ensuring that the flight crew is able to communicate freely in the cockpit, despite the continuous recording of their conversations.

[107]                     The Board takes this a step further. It argues that the safety implications of disclosure must be taken into account because if disclosure is too routine, pilots may intentionally erase CVR data to make it unavailable to investigators. Mr. Laporte noted that, in recent years, investigators have observed “a number” of cases where pilots may have erased or overwritten CVR data, although it is unclear whether this was done intentionally (A.R., at p. 1874, para. 88). The Board points to the experience of New Zealand, where flight crews may have disabled CVRs in response to a court ruling.

[108]                     This argument should be rejected. I agree with the Dubin Report’s conclusion that it would be “undesirable to create a privilege on the ground that those seeking it would otherwise not obey the law” (p. 234). The risk of intentional erasing or sabotage of a CVR cannot legitimately support the statutory privilege. This supposed justification runs counter to the Act’s goal of improving transportation safety and is predicated on the implausible and undocumented premise that professional pilots would wilfully put aircraft at risk. Strathy J. correctly dismissed the concern of intentional sabotage as incapable of supporting the privilege (Air France, at para. 135).

[109]                     However, safety considerations exist beyond the presence of a risk of sabotage of recording devices. I recognize that there is merit to the pilots’ argument that they may speak less freely if they sense that on‑board recordings will be more routinely disclosed. This is what some have referred to as a “chilling effect” associated with disclosure. But this consideration should not be overemphasized. In another context, this Court noted that it is “very easy to exaggerate [the] importance” of the risk to candour that disclosure may pose (Carey v. Ontario, 1986 CanLII 7 (SCC), [1986] 2 S.C.R. 637, at p. 657). In that case, La Forest J. observed that, while communications may be better conducted in private, there is doubt that “the candidness of confidential communications would be measurably affected by the off-chance that some communication might be required to be produced for the purposes of litigation” (p. 657). I note, too, that “assurance that disclosure will be ordered only where clearly necessary and then only to the extent necessary” may also assist in ensuring that pilots feel less inhibited from speaking freely in the cockpit (see M. (A.) v. Ryan, 1997 CanLII 403 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 157, at para. 35, in the context of a case‑by‑case privilege). I do not take Strathy J.’s statements at paras. 135‑36, relied upon by the chambers judge, as rejecting aviation safety and its relevance as a factor in the analysis. Instead, Strathy J. was properly relying upon the Dubin Report when he concluded that there was no evidentiary basis for the risk of sabotage of the CVR (paras. 135‑36). The chambers judge’s reliance on these portions of Air France was not an error. When his reasons are read as a whole, it is plain that the chambers judge recognized the importance of aviation safety to the statutory privilege and the importance of considering the adverse impact that the CVR’s release might have on aviation safety (see, e.g., Air France, at paras. 80, 129 and 138(4)).

(3)         Balancing the Interests

[110]                     As stated in the Dubin Report, if CVRs were unobtainable and absolutely privileged, an injured or deceased passenger could be “deprived of the only evidence available with respect to the cause of the accident”, which would “decide [the matter], once and for all, against the public interest in the administration of justice” (p. 234). Although the statutory privilege protects important interests and advances transportation safety, s. 28(6)(c) recognizes that, in some circumstances, this privilege must give way in order to ensure that courts can make findings of fact and deliver justice for litigants. Indeed, by setting up a balancing mechanism, Parliament signalled its intention that, sometimes, the truth‑seeking function of civil proceedings will take precedence over the privilege. Parliament could have chosen an absolute privilege, but it preferred a discretionary one.

[111]                     The ultimate balancing requires the court or coroner to identify the relevant factors and decide whether, in light of all of the circumstances, the public interest in the administration of justice commands production and discovery of the CVR, notwithstanding the weight accorded to the privilege by Parliament. When measuring the public interest in the administration of justice, the decision-maker should consider the recording’s relevance, probative value and necessity to resolving the issues in dispute as factors that point to the importance of the recording to a fair trial. On the privilege side of the scale, the decision-maker should consider the effect of release on pilot privacy and on transportation safety, as fostered by free communications in the cockpit. Air France and Hyde Park correctly identified most of these factors as relevant to the balancing exercise.

[112]                     All parties recognize that the test for production is not a simple relevance test. Care should be taken to not order production merely because the CVR would be helpful and provide complete evidence, something that Gauthier J. in Hyde Park rightly brought to light (para. 74). As the ACPA notes, testimony from the pilots will often have gaps. That is the nature of memory and live testimony. A court must consider not only the existence or number of gaps in the evidence but also the significance of the gaps in relation to the facts and legal issues in dispute. Other ways of filling gaps, including by refreshing pilots’ memory using the Board’s report or through witness statements, should also be considered (see Laporte Affidavit, A.R., at p. 1877, para. 99). A party seeking to set aside the statutory privilege must undertake reasonable measures to obtain the necessary information from other non‑privileged sources. A similar idea is expressed in the journalistic source privilege: disclosure is only possible where the “information or document cannot be produced in evidence by any other reasonable means” (CEA, s. 39.1(7)(a); see also National Post, at para. 66, on the “alternate sources” principle).

[113]                     As provided in s. 28(6)(c), the nature and scope of a production order can also include conditions on disclosure that limit the adverse effects on the policy pursued by Parliament in establishing the privilege. The decision-maker may impose the restrictions or conditions it deems appropriate to preserve pilot privacy and to inhibit free communications in the cockpit as little as possible. For example, a decision‑maker may choose to redact irrelevant material recorded on a CVR that could trench on privacy if disclosed, limit the persons to whom disclosure is made, require undertakings from those with access to the recording, or require the recording’s destruction once the legal proceedings have ended, as the chambers judge did in this case (Duncan J.’s order, December 18, 2019, reproduced in A.R., at pp. 25‑28). Other restrictions may also be tailored to the circumstances of the case to protect the interests of pilots and transportation safety.

[114]                     As the decision to order or refuse production is a discretionary one, the chambers judge’s conclusion is entitled to deference, insofar as the proper test and the relevant factors to be weighed were identified and applied in an appropriate manner. Importantly, it is not enough to state the test and the conclusion without undertaking a fact‑driven weighing exercise, as contemplated by the discretionary mechanism in s. 28(6)(c). When the chambers judge’s reasons are read as a whole, it is evident that he applied the correct test by properly identifying the two competing interests and how they are relevant on the facts of this case, and weighing the competing interests against each other. Importantly, he considered all of the evidence supporting the statutory privilege, including affidavit evidence provided by the Board and the ACPA.

[115]                     The Board argues that the chambers judge placed too much weight on relevance and reliability and did not consider whether there were other ways that the parties could obtain the evidence. I disagree. The chambers judge’s analysis centred on the necessity of the recording to the resolution of the dispute. In coming to the view that disclosure was necessary to fill the evidentiary gaps, he plainly understood that the relevance and reliability of the evidence that the CVR might provide was not enough. The importance of necessity to the analysis was recognized in Hyde Park, a case the Board contends was correctly decided, which considered the evidence’s “necessity to determine a core issue” and “other ways of getting the information before the [c]ourt” as key factors (A.F., at paras. 81‑82; see also Hyde Park, at para. 74).

[116]                     Respectfully, it is best to acknowledge, as Airbus did at the hearing in this Court, that the chambers judge’s reference to information being important to having a “complete understanding of the crew’s awareness”, in para. 67 of his reasons, is mistaken. It is not a useful description of the evidence required by the component of the test that relates to the public interest in the administration of justice. A civil trial will rarely have evidence adduced that provides a “complete understanding” of a matter in dispute and, given the standard of proof required in civil trials, this cannot be the measure under s. 28(6)(c).

[117]                     But the judge did not order the production of the CVR to achieve a “complete understanding” of the pilots’ role in the accident. As a result, he did not err in a material way by considering an irrelevant factor. Instead, he rightly said that the production of the CVR was “necessary” (para. 49) and that the CVR “represents the only way” to fill the gaps in the pilots’ discovery evidence (para. 48). Had completeness been the judge’s true measure for disclosure, he would have had no need to consider whether the CVR was necessary to resolve the dispute.

[118]                     Thus, insofar as the chambers judge may have misspoken in alluding to evidence that provides a “complete understanding” of a matter in dispute, this was not the test he applied in deciding to make the order. His conclusion that the disclosure of the CVR was necessary in order to fill the gaps in the evidence that were central to liability was plainly open to him.

[119]                     Before the chambers judge, Airbus prepared a chart in which it identified a number of matters that the flight crew could not remember about the events leading to the crash, including whether they had received weather updates or if they had discussed landing on a different runway or diverting the flight after receiving reports that visibility had decreased. Airbus also noted that the Board relied on audio captured by the CVR in its own report and that this evidence was otherwise unobtainable. Insight into the pilots’ decision making during landing is, of course, important to resolving the question of whether they operated the aircraft with due care and skill.

[120]                     The chambers judge considered the Board’s findings in its report, in particular the flight officers’ “perceptions, observations, considerations and decision making” in electing to land how and where they did (para. 27). On the basis of his review of the CVR, the chambers judge wrote that “it [was] evident” that the Board had taken information from the flight officers’ communications when it reported on the causal factors of the accident (para. 30; see also para. 46). He found that the evidence was not available from other sources for the purposes of the civil action (para. 48). This was the basis for his decision that the CVR, used by the Board in its report, was not just relevant and reliable evidence but was necessary to determining the causation and related issues in the action for civil liability (para. 49). After having considered the pleadings, evidence and submissions, the chambers judge concluded that the CVR was the only way to fill important gaps.

[121]                     The connection the chambers judge made between the findings in the Report, based in part on the CVR, and the issues at stake in the civil action was again open to him. There is a possible overlap between the issues of causation germane to the findings in the Report and causation as an element of the cause of action in the civil suit. As noted above, the possibility of such an overlap is recognized in s. 7(2) of the Act. For the chambers judge, the CVR was necessary to resolving the civil action because of the failings in the pilots’ recollections of the descent. Plainly, the chambers judge’s chain of reasoning was based on his understanding of all the evidence, the submissions of the parties, his in camera review of the CVR and the Board’s use of it in the Report. His decision to order disclosure deserves deference on appeal.

[122]                     Finally, the chambers judge considered the affidavit evidence provided by the Board and the ACPA relating to the public interest in upholding the privilege, including privacy interests and the potential chilling effect that could occur if production were ordered too readily (N.S.S.C. reasons, at paras. 34‑35). He acknowledged that pilot privacy and encouraging free communications in the cockpit were the two purposes behind the privilege (para. 54, quoting Air France, at para. 130). The chambers judge was also alive to important differences between Air France and this case, which affected the importance of the privilege. For example, unlike in Air France, the flight crew here opposed the CVR’s release (paras. 57‑58). In the end, after considering all of the evidence, he found that placing strict conditions on the release of the CVR would properly protect pilot privacy, as he was entitled to do (para. 69). In doing so, he expressed agreement with Strathy J.’s conclusion that, notwithstanding the privacy and safety concerns animating the privilege, disclosure of the CVR “in this case” would not have a detrimental effect on either privacy or safety (paras. 54‑55, quoting Air France, at para. 135). He concluded by finding that production in this case would not erode the privilege and that court oversight over the production would “hono[ur] the privilege to the extent that is necessary” (para. 60). Thus, the chambers judge did not fail to consider a relevant factor, nor did he err in his balancing by assigning no weight to a relevant factor. Ultimately, he considered both purposes behind the privilege, weighed those purposes against the public interest in the administration of justice, and concluded that Parliament’s goals would not be unduly harmed by disclosure in this case.

[123]                     The overall weighing of the factors by the chambers judge was fact‑driven and discretionary. Based on the evidence and the strength of his findings of fact, he was entitled to conclude that limited production should be ordered. Others might have balanced differently by assigning more weight to some of the factors and less to others in the circumstances. But absent an error of law, a palpable and overriding error of fact or proof that discretion has been abused, the chambers judge’s balancing should not be disturbed. No basis for intervention has been shown.

VI.         Conclusion

[124]                     The appeal is dismissed. The appellant did not seek costs and asked that no costs be awarded against it. The class action plaintiffs seek costs, as they note that the Board’s appeals have “delayed the prosecution of the class action for over two years” (R.F., at para. 141). Airbus and the Halifax International Airport Authority also request costs. The remaining respondents either seek no costs or take no position on costs.

[125]                     I acknowledge that appeals to the Court of Appeal and this Court, initiated by the Board, may have delayed the prosecution of the underlying class action. However, all parties in this dispute have a stake in safe air transportation; they share a stake in the public interest in the administration of justice and the public interest concerns underlying the statutory privilege. The Board, in bringing appeals of the chambers judge’s decision, sought legitimate clarification on how these shared public interests must be balanced. In such circumstances, I would thus not order costs against it in this Court or disturb the Court of Appeal’s decision to award no costs. That said, I would not interfere with the discretion the chambers judge exercised to award costs as he did at first instance.

The reasons of Côté and Brown JJ. were delivered by

 

                  Côté J. —

I.               Overview

[126]                     I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of my colleague Kasirer J. As my colleague outlines, there are two principal issues in this appeal, both of which involve the interpretation of the Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board Act, S.C. 1989, c. 3 (the “Act”). The first issue is procedural in nature. It relates to whether s. 28(6)(b) of the Act entitles the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (the “Board”) to make submissions in the absence of the public and the other parties. The second issue is substantive in nature. It relates to whether the chambers judge erred in his articulation and application of the legal test when he ordered production of the contents of the privileged on‑board cockpit voice recorder (the “CVR”) pursuant to s. 28(6)(c) of the Act.

[127]                     With respect to the procedural issue, I disagree with my colleague’s conclusion that the Board’s request to make submissions in the absence of the public and the other parties is, in substance, a request to make ex parte submissions. In my view, the Board’s request to make submissions in the absence of the public and the other parties is more accurately characterized as a request to make submissions in camera (“à huis clos” in French). Moreover, I am of the view that a textual and purposive interpretation of s. 28(6)(b) indicates that the Board has a statutory right to make submissions in camera. In order to uphold the Board’s statutory duty to protect the privilege attached to the CVR in a manner that preserved the Board’s right to make meaningful submissions, the chambers judge should have permitted it to make its submissions in camera.

[128]                     With respect to the substantive issue, my colleague and I part company on two main points. First, I agree with much of what my colleague says about the test for production under s. 28(6)(c) of the Act. However, I disagree with his application of the standard of review. Even on my colleague’s generous reading, the chambers judge’s reasons disclose numerous errors of law. His discretionary decision to order production of the CVR is fundamentally tainted by these errors and is owed no deference. I am particularly concerned that by endorsing the chambers judge’s decision, my colleague is undermining the more rigorous and nuanced test he sets out. Second, my colleague attempts to get around various errors of law by relying heavily on the chambers judge’s findings of fact. By doing so, he appears to conduct the discretionary balancing of considerations himself. However, this Court is not in a position to conduct the balancing exercise required to order disclosure under s. 28(6)(c): the CVR is not part of the record and no member of this Court has listened to it or read the transcript of its contents. In the circumstances of this case, only a decision maker who has examined the contents of the CVR is in the position to weigh the relevant factors appropriately.

[129]                     Therefore, and with respect, I cannot agree with parts of my colleague’s reasons and with his disposition of this appeal. For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal and remit the matter to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.

II.            Analysis

A.           Can the Board Make Submissions Without the Public and the Other Parties Present?

[130]                     Section 28(6)(b) of the Act states that where a request for the production and discovery of an on‑board recording is made, “the court or coroner shall . . . in camera, examine the on‑board recording and give the Board a reasonable opportunity to make representations with respect thereto”. The Board submits that the expression “in camera”, followed by a comma, is intended to qualify all the words that follow. According to the Board, the court shall (i) examine the on‑board recording in camera; and (ii) provide the Board with a reasonable opportunity to make representations with respect to the on‑board recording in camera.

[131]                     In the lower courts, the Board framed its request using the words “ex parte” rather than “in camera”. In this Court, however, the Board altered its language, arguing that it has a statutory right to make in camera submissions. Despite this change in language, the Board has consistently sought the same outcome: it wants to make, at least in part, submissions in the absence of the other parties and the public. In other words, it wants, to the extent necessary, to make private and confidential submissions (transcript, at pp. 37‑38).

[132]                     Contrary to my colleague’s conclusion, I agree that the Board is properly seeking to make in camera, rather than ex parte, submissions. In Ruby v. Canada (Solicitor General), 2002 SCC 75, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 3, this Court explained that “[e]x parte, in a legal sense, means a proceeding, or a procedural step, that is taken or granted at the instance of and for the benefit of one party only, without notice to or argument by any adverse party” (para. 25 (emphasis added)). Ex parte proceedings are therefore distinct from in camera proceedings. Some proceedings, by their nature, must be both ex parte and in camera — that is, they must be conducted in private and without notice to or submissions by the adverse party. However, ex parte proceedings need not be held in camera, as “ex parte submissions are often made in open court” and “an order will still be considered ex parte where the other party happens to be present at the hearing but does not make submissions” (Ruby, at para. 26).

[133]                     I respectfully disagree with my colleague’s conclusion (at para. 60) that the Board’s request to make its submissions in the absence of the public and the other parties is, in substance, a request to make ex parte submissions. In my view, given that the Board agreed to provide notice to the other parties as well as to provide them with a non‑privileged summary of its submissions, its request to make its submissions in the absence of the public and the other parties cannot be characterized as a request to make ex parte submissions; rather, it is more properly characterized as a request to make in camera submissions. My colleague emphasizes that Parliament could have used the term “ex parte”, as it did in s. 19(3) of the Act, but that it chose not to do so. With respect, the use of the term “ex parte” in s. 19(3) of the Act is consistent with my definition of “ex parte”, as this section relates to an ex parte application — that is, one made without notice and without submissions from the adverse party. Accordingly, had Parliament used the phrase “ex parte” in s. 28(6)(b), as my colleague implies that it could have done, then the Board would either not be required to provide notice of its submissions or the adverse parties would not be permitted to make arguments related to the production of the CVR.

[134]                     As well, I agree with the Board’s statutory interpretation argument. In my view, a textual and purposive interpretation of s. 28(6)(b) leads to the conclusion that the Board is entitled to make its submissions in camera — that is, in the absence of the public and the other parties.

[135]                     For the reasons set out below, I agree with the Board’s submission that the expression “in camera”, at the beginning of the provision, followed by a comma, means that “in camera” qualifies all of the words that follow. Therefore, both the examination of the CVR by the court as well as the Board’s “reasonable opportunity” to make representations concerning the CVR are to be in camera.

[136]                     First, the presence or absence of a comma may indicate whether an adjective or qualifier is intended to apply only to the nearest word or all the words that follow it or precede it, as the case may be. As Professor Ruth Sullivan explains,

[a] comma before the qualifying words is sometimes taken to indicate that they are meant to apply to all antecedents while the absence of a comma indicates that they are meant to apply to the last antecedent alone.

 

(The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at p. 463)

[137]                     The case Re Associated Commercial Protectors Ltd. and Mason (1970), 1970 CanLII 912 (MB KB), 13 D.L.R. (3d) 643 (Man. Q.B.), aff’d (1970), 1970 CanLII 889 (MB CA), 16 D.L.R. (3d) 478 (C.A.), provides an example of how the above principle was relied upon to interpret a statutory provision, s. 78 of Manitoba’s Consumer Protection Act, S.M. 1969 (2nd Sess.), c. 4:

78(1) The director may refuse to grant a licence as a vendor, direct seller, or collection agent

 

(a) to any person who has been convicted of any offence against the Criminal Code (Canada) or against this Act, or of any other offence committed in Canada, that, in the opinion of the director, involves a dishonest act or intent on the part of the offender;

 

Relying on punctuation to resolve the ambiguity in the provision, Nitikman J. stated:

I take the view that the concluding words “involves a dishonest act or intent on the part of the offender” qualify all the offences mentioned in the clause and not merely the last‑mentioned category “any other offence committed in Canada”, because if it were not so then a comma would not be required after the words “committed in Canada”. [p. 644]

[138]                     Put differently, with some of the irrelevant words omitted, the section without the comma would read as follows:

. . . who has been convicted of any offence against the Criminal Code (Canada) or against this Act, or of any other offence committed in Canada that involves a dishonest act or intent . . . .

[139]                     This change shows the relevance of the comma. Once the comma is omitted, the words “involves a dishonest act or intent on the part of the offender” would apply only to the phrase “any other offence committed in Canada” and not to offences in the Criminal Code or the Consumer Protection Act. The same reasoning can be followed in the case at bar.

[140]                     In s. 28(6)(b) of the Act, the comma following the expression “in camera” qualifies the words subsequent to it. “In camera” applies to everything after the comma because of the comma. By contrast, when the comma is omitted, s. 28(6)(b) reads as follows:

in camera examine the on‑board recording and give the Board a reasonable opportunity to make representations with respect thereto;

Without the comma, “in camera” applies only to the word “examine”. This, however, lacks grammatical sense. One does not “in camera examine” something. It is therefore plainly obvious that “in camera”, as a qualifier, only makes sense when followed by a comma. Had Parliament intended for “in camera” to apply only to “examine”, the Latin expression would follow the term “examine” — “examine in camera”.

[141]                     Second, the structural difference between the former s. 34(1) of the Canadian Aviation Safety Board Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑12 (“CASB Act”), and s. 28(6)(b) of the Act is relevant in discerning legislative intent. Under s. 34(1) of the CASB Act, the decision maker was required to

(b) in camera, examine the cockpit voice recording, and

(c) give the Board a reasonable opportunity to make representations with respect thereto . . . .

 

 

By comparison, s. 28(6)(b) of the Act reads as follows:

 

 

(b) in camera, examine the on‑board recording and give the Board a reasonable opportunity to make representations with respect thereto;

[142]                     This structural change should not be overlooked. As my colleague notes, s. 34(1) of the CASB Act separated the requirements now set out in s. 28(6)(b) of the Act into two paragraphs, “thereby indicating that ‘in camera’ in the English text only applied to the decision‑maker’s examination of the recording” (para. 66). On that point, he is plainly right; the words “in camera” could not apply to a paragraph which they were not a part of. However, drawing on extrinsic evidence, my colleague concludes that “[t]he legislative history supports the respondents’ interpretation of s. 28(6)(b)” (para. 66).

[143]                     With respect, the problem with this conclusion is that it disregards the text of s. 28(6)(b) as enacted. While it is true that the words “in camera” in s. 34(1)(b) of the CASB Act applied only to the decision maker’s examination of the recording, the text of the current provision has changed significantly. As previously noted, former paras. (b) and (c) were combined, and the comma after the word “recording” was removed, thereby bringing the phrase “opportunity to make representations” within the scope of the “in camera” qualifier. It follows that any ambiguity under the former provision has now been resolved by collapsing paragraphs (b) and (c) and by removing the comma after “recording”. In my view, all of this rather indicates that the English version of the text has one meaning, and only one meaning, contrary to the ambiguity which my colleague nevertheless seems to detect (para. 73).

[144]                     Another problem that arises from my colleague’s argument is that it conflicts rather strongly, given the structural change and removal of the comma, with the presumption that changes to the law are purposeful. As Laskin J. explained in Bathurst Paper Ltd. v. Minister of Municipal Affairs of New Brunswick, 1971 CanLII 176 (SCC), [1972] S.C.R. 471, the presumption must be that Parliament intended to bring about some change in the manner of the law’s application:

There is another consideration that is equally telling. Legislative changes may reasonably be viewed as purposive, unless there is internal or admissible external evidence to show that only language polishing was intended. [pp. 477‑78]

[145]                     It follows that meaning ought to be given to Parliament’s choice of combining paras. (b) and (c) in s. 28(6) of the Act. In this instance, the only plausible interpretation is that “in camera” was intended to apply both to the examination of the recording and to the opportunity to make representations.

[146]                     Readily citing and deferring to the observations of Transport Canada, my colleague concludes that the presumption of purposeful change is displaced in this case (para. 67). In my respectful view, the legislative history surrounding the enactment of s. 28(6) cannot trump the plain meaning of the text. The law, as duly enacted by Parliament, is the law. It does not matter what Transport Canada said; what matters is what Parliament did. Here, Parliament clearly made a substantive change to the law, as revealed by the text of the provision. Put simply, what someone, at some time, says about the law is not the law.

[147]                     I acknowledge that the French version of the provision has a fundamentally different structure than the English version. The relevant portion of the French version provides as follows:

(6) Par dérogation aux autres dispositions du présent article, le tribunal ou le coroner qui, dans le cours de procédures devant lui, est saisi d’une demande de production et d’examen d’un enregistrement de bord examine celui-ci à huis clos et donne au Bureau la possibilité de présenter des observations à ce sujet après lui avoir transmis un avis de la demande, dans le cas où celui‑ci n’est pas partie aux procédures.

[148]                     In my view, the text of the English version indicates that submissions are to be made in camera, whereas the text of the French version is silent on the nature of the Board’s submissions. My colleague’s understanding of the French version, however, may be accepted, and it may be readily acknowledged that the French version has one meaning and the English version another. In any case, there is a discordance between the two versions, which justifies having recourse to the purposive approach rather than looking for a shared meaning that is simply absent.

[149]                     My colleague concludes that, even if there is a true disparity between the two provisions, their “shared meaning aligns with the unambiguous French text” (para. 72). With respect, even if the shared meaning aligns with the French text, the analysis does not end there. As Bastarache J. instructed in R. v. Daoust, 2004 SCC 6, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 217, the next step is to “determine whether the common or dominant meaning is, according to the ordinary rules of statutory interpretation, consistent with Parliament’s intent” (para. 30). As I will explain below, only the English version is consistent with a purposive interpretation of the provision. For this reason, it should be preferred.

[150]                     My colleague recognizes that “[t]he purpose and scheme of the Act suggest that, notwithstanding the absence of a general rule allowing for such submissions, there must be a way for the Board to make representations about the content of a recording without defeating the privilege entirely” (para. 75). Yet, despite recognizing that the broader meaning of the provision is supported by the purpose and scheme of the Act, he rejects that interpretation in favour of the narrower one. With respect, I see no principled reason for presuming that the narrower version is the clearest expression of legislative intent when that interpretation is refuted by a purposive analysis.

[151]                     A purposive interpretation of s. 28(6)(b) supports the Board’s position that it has a right, to the extent necessary, to make in camera submissions about the contents of the CVR. Pursuant to s. 28(6)(b), the Board must be provided with a “reasonable opportunity to make representations” regarding the request for production of the CVR. In my view, the Board’s right to make reasonable representations must be interpreted in light of the Board’s statutory object as well as Parliament’s decision to create a statutory privilege.

[152]                     First, as outlined in s. 7(1) of the Act, the object of the Board is to advance transportation safety by conducting independent investigations, identifying safety deficiencies, making recommendations, and reporting publicly on its investigations. The CVR is used in the course of the Board’s investigation, and it is privileged to protect the privacy of pilots and to aid the Board in fulfilling its mandate. Moreover, the Board has a statutory obligation to protect and maintain the privilege, as it is prevented from knowingly communicating the contents of the CVR or permitting them to be communicated to any person (s. 28(2)(a)).

[153]                     Second, Parliament’s choice to create a statutory privilege over the CVR must be given effect. If the Board is limited to open‑court submissions, it cannot go into any detail about the contents of the CVR without risking breaching the privilege it is duty‑bound to uphold. The Board is uniquely positioned to assist the court in determining whether, pursuant to s. 28(6)(c) of the Act, “the public interest in the proper administration of justice outweighs in importance the privilege attached to the on‑board recording”. The Board has technical expertise in transportation safety and is the only entity (besides the court) in possession of the CVR. The Board is therefore uniquely positioned to assist the court in understanding the contents of the CVR as well as identifying other, non‑privileged sources that may duplicate important information in the CVR.

[154]                     In conclusion, to the extent that it is necessary to protect the privilege, I agree with the Board that it has a right to make submissions in camera. Such an interpretation furthers the object of the Act and helps to protect the privilege, ensuring that it yields only when it is truly in the public interest to do so.

[155]                     In any event, I note that even on my colleague’s interpretation, the court, by necessary implication, retains the discretion to permit the Board to make submissions in the absence of the other parties. In my view, given the Board’s expertise and statutory obligation to protect the privilege, sufficient weight must be given to its request to make private or confidential submissions.

[156]                     It follows that the chambers judge erred by refusing to permit the Board to make submissions in camera.

B.            Test for Production Under Section 28(6)(c)

(1)         The Chambers Judge’s Reasons Disclose Legal Errors and Are Owed No Deference

[157]                     The test for production under s. 28(6)(c) of the Act requires the court to assess whether “the public interest in the proper administration of justice outweighs in importance the privilege attached to the on‑board recording by virtue of this section”. There are two sides to the scale that must be assessed and weighed: (i) the public interest in the proper administration of justice; and (ii) the importance of the statutory privilege attached to the CVR. This weighing — and the corresponding decision about whether to order production of the CVR — is discretionary.

[158]                     With respect, I disagree with my colleague’s assertion that the test for production of the CVR as articulated in Société Air France v. Greater Toronto Airports Authority (2009), 85 C.P.C. (6th) 334 (Ont. S.C.J.), aff’d on this point 2010 ONCA 598, 324 D.L.R. (4th) 567, “does not stand in substantial opposition to” (para. 97) the test as articulated in Wappen‑Reederei GmbH & Co. KG v. Hyde Park (The), 2006 FC 150, [2006] 4 F.C.R. 272. The test as articulated in Air France, and as adopted by the chambers judge in this case, places the wrong weights on both sides of the scale. On the side relating to the public interest in the administration of justice, Air France overemphasizes irrelevant factors, such as the existence of a class action, thereby inappropriately inflating the need to ensure that the evidence before the court “is as complete and reliable as possible” (Air France, at para. 127). On the other side of the scale, regarding the importance of the privilege, Air France diminishes the privacy and safety goals that animate the privilege conferred by Parliament, thereby eviscerating the privilege. In my view, Air France effectively reduces the test for production of the CVR to a consideration of relevance and reliability. With respect, much more is required.

[159]                     The CVR will almost always provide a more reliable account of what the pilots said than the pilots’ own memory of the cockpit discussions. By recording real‑time events in the cockpit, the CVR provides a contemporaneous recording of the cockpit discussions as well as other sounds captured by it. Similarly, in litigation relating to an aviation accident, the CVR will almost always — if not always — be relevant to various issues in the litigation.

[160]                     As such, a party seeking production of the CVR must establish more than relevance and reliability. Indeed, requiring only that relevance and reliability be established — without otherwise requiring proof that production of the CVR is necessary to the resolution of a core issue in the litigation — would be fundamentally inconsistent with the creation of a privilege in the first place: “Unlike most other rules of exclusion, privilege rules are not designed to facilitate the truth-finding process. They operate where there is an overriding public policy interest in excluding relevant, reliable evidence . . .” (D. M. Paciocco, P. Paciocco and L. Stuesser, The Law of Evidence (8th ed. 2020), at p. 287). I accept that Parliament created only a partial privilege that, when necessary, must yield to the public interest in the administration of justice. However, in my view, in order for the public interest to outweigh the privilege, much more is required than mere relevance and reliability.

[161]                     Accordingly, when considering the side of the scale relating to the public interest in the administration of justice, the court should focus on “the nature and probative value of the evidence in the particular case and how necessary this evidence is for the proper determination of a core issue before the [c]ourt” (Hyde Park, at para. 74). Conversely, when balancing the importance of the privilege, the court should “give appropriate weight to the privilege”, including both the privacy and the safety considerations that animate the privilege, in order to “avoid routinely allowing disclosure simply because of the probative value normally attached to audio recordings of events” (Hyde Park, at para. 74).

[162]                     This was not the test that the chambers judge applied. He therefore erred in law and his decision to order production of the CVR is owed no deference. It is trite law that deference is generally owed to discretionary decisions. However, appellate courts do not blindly adopt a deferential posture: deference is owed when the first instance judge has considered and weighed all relevant considerations and where the exercise of discretion is not based on an erroneous principle (Canada (Attorney General) v. Fontaine, 2017 SCC 47, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 205, at para. 36). No deference is owed when the judge errs in principle, considers irrelevant factors, or fails to consider relevant factors. These are errors of law that are reviewed on a correctness standard (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 27).

[163]                     Although I largely agree with my colleague’s description of the standard of review, I cannot endorse his application of it. With respect, the chambers judge’s reasons, which closely follow the law as articulated in Air France, illustrate that he erred when considering both sides of the scale. The chambers judge applied the wrong test, as he effectively reduced the test for production to a test of relevance and reliability. To borrow my colleague’s apt description of the standard of review, the chambers judge put the “wrong weights on the scales”. His balancing is therefore “inherently flawed” (para. 41). Given the legal errors, the chambers judge’s discretionary decision to order production of the CVR is owed no deference.

(a)           Public Interest in the Administration of Justice

[164]                     On the public interest side of the scale, the chambers judge considered irrelevant factors. The chambers judge based his analysis on a specific consideration of the policies and objectives of class actions. As my colleague correctly notes, the public interest in the administration of justice is the same in class actions as it is in other civil proceedings. Indeed, I completely agree with my colleague that “[i]solating class actions as having heightened significance in the weighing exercise could inappropriately upset the balancing process and devalue the importance Parliament has attributed to the privilege” (para. 99). Yet, this is exactly what the chambers judge did. He took into account the behaviour modification goal of class actions when considering the public interest in the administration of justice. By doing so, he incorrectly considered an irrelevant factor, adding undue weight to the public interest side of the scale. I find that the chambers judge’s improper statement of the law amounts to a reviewable error.

[165]                     The standard of review that applies when a lower court considers irrelevant or erroneous factors is clearly stated in para. 35 of Housen:

Stated differently, the lower courts committed an error in law by finding that sub‑delegation was a factor identifying a person who is part of the “directing mind” of a company, when the correct legal factor characterizing a “directing mind” is in fact “the capacity to exercise decision-making authority on matters of corporate policy”. This mischaracterization of the proper legal test (the legal requirements to be a “directing mind”) infected or tainted the lower courts’ factual conclusion that Captain Kelch was part of the directing mind. As this erroneous finding can be traced to an error in law, less deference was required and the applicable standard was one of correctness. [Emphasis added.]

[166]                     My colleague suggests that an incorrect legal finding must be “decisive” to the overall outcome in order to taint a discretionary decision (para. 100). I respectfully disagree with this formulation of the inquiry. The exercise of judicial discretion is governed by “legal criteria,” and consequently, “their definition as well as a failure to apply them or a misapplication of them raise questions of law which are subject to appellate review” (British Columbia (Minister of Forests) v. Okanagan Indian Band, 2003 SCC 71, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 371, at para. 43). Be it as it may, if a judge considers an irrelevant factor and gives it any weight whatsoever, he or she has effectively applied the wrong legal test, and any conclusion that follows is inherently flawed. Although I acknowledge that, in principle, a judge may misspeak and name a factor without considering it per se, thereby not tainting the overall conclusion, I do not believe this is what happened in this case.

[167]                     If my understanding of my colleague’s reasons is accurate, he rejects the idea that the chambers judge’s ultimate factual conclusion can be traced to his incorrect legal finding. My colleague writes that “[n]otwithstanding his comments on the importance of behavior modification by class action, the chambers judge recognized the necessity of the CVR for a fair trial as a matter of negligence law” (para. 100). As a result, he concludes that the chambers judge’s consideration of class actions (based on Air France, at para. 127) was not “decisive” (para. 100). In other words, he states that consideration of this factor did not have “a material effect on the ultimate decision to order production and discovery and thus do[es] not amount to a fatal error” (para. 100).

[168]                     I respectfully disagree. Even applying my colleague’s test of “decisiveness”, I would still find that the judge erred. This factor had a material impact on the ultimate result and to conclude otherwise ignores that the chambers judge effectively said so himself. Indeed, he relied heavily on the decision of Strathy J. (as he then was) in Air France, as revealed by the extensive and numerous excerpts he cites from that case. The chambers judge quoted the following passage from Air France:

There is another aspect of the public interest in the administration of justice that is particularly applicable to class proceedings litigation such as this. Behaviour modification is an important goal of class actions. Just as the [Board] serves an important function in exposing shortcomings in the transportation system and making recommendations to correct them, so too the class action identifies the causes of a mass wrong and encourages those responsible to modify their behaviour. It seems to me that there is a public interest in ensuring that the information available to the court, in the performance of this important responsibility, is as complete and reliable as possible. [Emphasis added.]

 

(2019 NSSC 339, 45 C.P.C. (8th) 124, at para. 51, quoting Air France, at para. 127.)

[169]                     The chambers judge “accept[ed] this as a correct statement of law and principle relating to the public interest” (chambers judge’s reasons, at para. 52). Moreover, when subsequently summarizing his rationale for finding that the public interest outweighed the privilege, the chambers judge reiterated the behaviour modification objective of class actions, claiming that “[t]his too provides a public interest rationale for transparency in the litigation process” (para. 66).

[170]                     In my view, the judge wholeheartedly endorsed the above passage from Air France and relied upon it not once but twice in his balancing exercise. This, in turn, added undue weight to the public interest side of the scale and tainted his overall conclusion. In this context, if the chambers judge explicitly says that an irrelevant factor “appl[ies] to the current circumstances” (para. 52), what more is needed for his factual conclusion to be traceable to this incorrect legal finding? The inescapable conclusion is that his mischaracterization of the legal test tainted his overall balancing exercise. Correctness should therefore prevail.

[171]                     With regard to the public interest in the administration of justice, my colleague states at para. 112 of his reasons that “[c]are should be taken to not order production merely because the CVR would be helpful and provide complete evidence”. Once again, I agree with him.

[172]                     However, the chambers judge did not adhere to this approach. To the contrary, he wholly endorsed the law as stated in Air France, which emphasized that the information available to the court for determining liability in a class action should be “as complete and reliable as possible” (para. 51, quoting Air France, at para. 127). Later in his reasons, the chambers judge again stated that disclosure of the CVR was needed to have “a complete understanding of the crew’s awareness and response to factors that were significant to the decision to land the aircraft in the conditions existing at that time” (para. 67 (emphasis added)). Thus, rather than taking care not to order production simply because the CVR would provide complete evidence, the chambers judge explicitly ordered production for this very reason.

[173]                     My colleague attempts to downplay these errors, stating that when the reasons are read as a whole, it is evident that the chambers judge applied the correct test (Kasirer J.’s reasons, at para. 114). With respect, there is no basis to conclude, as my colleague does, that the chambers judge misspoke on two separate occasions. Ultimately, the chambers judge’s reasons disclose multiple legal errors in his discussion of the public interest in the administration of justice. These errors improperly tipped the scales in favour of disclosure.

(b)         Importance of the Privilege — Privacy and Safety

[174]                     On the side of the scale relating to the importance of the privilege, again, the chambers judge’s reasons disclose multiple errors. I agree with my colleague that the protection of privacy and the protection of safety are the two principles that animate the statutory privilege. However, I respectfully disagree with my colleague’s reading of Air France regarding these principles.

(i)            Privacy

[175]                     My colleague states, correctly in my view, that the publication of a report by the Board does not mean that the concern for pilot privacy is “largely illusory” when the court is considering whether the CVR should be released under s. 28(6)(c). However, in Air France, Strathy J. came to the opposite conclusion, stating that the concern for pilot privacy was “largely illusory” or “generally illusory” in light of the fact that a summary of the pilots’ conversations may have been disclosed in the Board’s publicly available report (Air France, at para. 133). To be clear, Strathy J. was of the view that judicial vetting of the CVR and sterile cockpit rules already addressed pilot privacy concerns. According to his reasoning then, there is no need to account for privacy concerns in the balancing test given that those concerns are addressed by other mechanisms. With respect, I say that is not the law. Nevertheless, the chambers judge in this case “adopted Chief Justice Strathy’s reasons to reject the suggestion that privacy interests will be inappropriately invaded” (chambers judge’s reasons, at para. 59), writing that he “could not state this better” (para. 55).

[176]                     This is an error of law. I agree with my colleague that the concern for pilot privacy does not become “largely illusory” simply because the Board releases a report that may document in some manner what the pilots said. However, this more nuanced understanding of privacy was not adopted in Air France or by the chambers judge in this case. In my respectful view, my colleague’s discussion overlooks what the chambers judge actually stated, as his statement of the law on the importance of privacy is manifestly inconsistent with my colleague’s view of the law.

(ii)         Safety

[177]                     With respect to safety, I once again agree with my colleague’s statement of the law. As my colleague notes, the Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Aviation Safety (1981) recognized “investigators’ concerns that disclosure of investigative materials could have negative consequences for witness cooperation in future cases . . . and that disclosure of CVRs to the public could mean the ‘cause of aviation safety would be prejudiced’” (para. 106 (citations omitted)). There is therefore “merit to the pilots’ argument that they may speak less freely if they sense that on-board recordings will be more routinely disclosed” (Kasirer J.’s reasons, at para. 109). I similarly agree that concerns about pilots intentionally erasing the CVR cannot legitimately support the statutory privilege (Kasirer J.’s reasons, at para. 108).

[178]                     Yet, and once again with respect, this is not the law as articulated in Air France or by the chambers judge in this case. Indeed, it is worthwhile to quote the exact passage from Air France that was wholly “endorse[d]” by the chambers judge (chambers judge’s reasons, at para. 55). The judge quoted the following passage from Air France:

As I stated above, I have great difficulty in accepting that the disclosure of the CVR in this case would have a “chilling” effect on communications between pilots. This argument carried no weight with the Dubin Commission, which concluded that the CVR could be released by the court, in appropriate cases, without impairing aviation safety. As I have noted, the transcripts are released as a matter of course in some countries. The Review Panel has recommended that the [Board] be permitted to disclose the CVR record in its reports. The suggestion of a chilling effect has no evidentiary basis and is nothing more than speculation.

 

The public places a great deal of trust in pilots. I am certain that pilots take this responsibility very seriously indeed and that they deserve the public’s trust. I cannot imagine that pilots would curtail critical communications, endangering their own safety and the safety of their passengers, simply because those communications might be disclosed in some future legal proceedings in the event of an accident. [Emphasis added.]

 

(Chambers judge’s reasons, at para. 54, citing Air France, at paras. 135‑36.)

[179]                     My colleague writes that he does “not take Strathy J.’s statements at paras. 135‑36, relied upon by the chambers judge, as rejecting aviation safety and its relevance as a factor in the analysis” (para. 109). With respect, this interpretation is inconsistent with what was said in Air France and endorsed by the chambers judge. Indeed, after quoting the above passage from Air France, the chambers judge’s reasons are notably silent on any potential safety considerations, other than a conclusory statement that he was “not convinced” that the release of the CVR with conditions would “interfere with aviation safety, damage relations between pilots and their employers, or would impede investigation of aviation accidents” (para. 68). In my view, this demonstrates that the chambers judge rejected aviation safety as a factor to be considered. He thus erred in law.

(2)         This Court Cannot Reweigh Based on Conclusory and Vague Findings

[180]                     For the reasons discussed above, I am of the view that the chambers judge’s decision is owed no deference. Nonetheless, my colleague attempts to sidestep the chambers judge’s legal errors by emphasizing various findings of fact made by him.

[181]                     In my respectful view, the chambers judge’s findings are incomplete and conclusory. For example, he found that there were gaps in the flight crew’s discovery evidence (paras. 46‑48). While “some questions” could be answered by other means, his “overall observation” was that disclosure of the CVR was “necessary to answering important questions” (para. 48). He then concluded that the “CVR has important evidentiary value and is necessary” (para. 49).

[182]                     However, these findings do not provide sufficient information for this Court to conclude, as my colleague does, that production of the CVR was “necessary to resolving the dispute” (Kasirer J.’s reasons, at para. 5; see also paras. 10, 28, 31 and 121). No finding was made that it was necessary to resolve the dispute; rather, the chambers judge made a vague finding that production of the CVR was necessary to answer important questions. There is nothing in the chambers judge’s reasons that indicates what questions or how many questions from the flight crew’s discovery evidence can be answered only with the disclosure of the CVR. The nature and probative value of the evidence in this particular case and how necessary this evidence is for the proper determination of a core issue before the court are therefore unclear.

[183]                     Moreover, to the extent that the chambers judge found that production of the CVR was “necessary” (para. 49), this needs to be understood in light of his statements — made two separate times in the reasons — that it was important to have “complete” information before the court (see paras. 51 and 67). With respect, these erroneous statements cast doubt on the chambers judge’s purported finding of “necessity”. Was disclosure of the CVR “necessary” to ensure that the court had complete information before it, or was disclosure of the CVR “necessary” for the court to determine the ultimate issue of liability?

[184]                     In my view, given that no member of this Court has heard the CVR or read the transcript of its contents, this Court is simply not in a position to reweigh the evidence and conduct the discretionary balancing required under s. 28(6)(c) of the Act. This Court should not selectively overemphasize some of the chambers judge’s conclusory and ambiguous findings while discounting other statements from his reasons that disclose a misapprehension of the legal test. Doing so reduces the discretionary test under s. 28(6)(c) to a perfunctory consideration of factors on a checklist rather than a judicious weighing of factors in an exercise of discretion.

III.         Disposition

[185]                     For the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal and remit the matter to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to be heard by a different judge.

[186]                     The Board did not seek costs. I would therefore order no costs in this Court.

                    Appeal dismissed without costs, Côté and Brown JJ. dissenting.

JUDGMENT

 

The appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, Number CACR3188, 2022 SKCA 36, dated March 17, 2022, was heard on November 30, 2022, and the Court on that day delivered the following judgment orally:

 

 

Karakatsanis J. — We agree with Justice Leurer, in dissent, that a specific Hibbert type instruction (R. v. Hibbert, 2002 SCC 39, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 445) was required in the circumstances of this case. The appeal is allowed, substantially for the reasons of Justice Leurer. The conviction is set aside and a new trial ordered.


2022 SCC 50

JUDGMENT

 

The appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador, Number 202001H0011, 2022 NLCA 2, dated January 7, 2022, was heard on December 1, 2022, and the Court on that day delivered the following judgment orally:

 

Rowe J. — This is an appeal as of right from a decision of the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal setting aside acquittals and ordering a new trial in a case of sexual assault, among other offences.

 

The accused is the grandfather of the complainant, who was between 7 and 10 at the time of the alleged offences. There was evidence that the complainant was happy to see the accused and exhibited no avoidant behaviour toward him. From this, the trial judge inferred that the complainant had a “strong and normal” relationship with the accused, which caused the trial judge to doubt the credibility of her testimony regarding the alleged offences. Writing for the majority, Hoegg J.A. observed that the trial judge “rested his reasonable doubt on his conclusion . . . that their strong and normal relationship meant that her grandfather could not have been sexually abusing her” (para. 34 (CanLII)).

 

 

 

We agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that this inference by the trial judge was rooted in stereotypical reasoning, rather than the entirety of the evidence, and that this constituted an error of law. While the trial judge set out other lines of reasoning relating to the complainant’s credibility, his reliance on stereotypical inferences undermines his assessment of her credibility and, thus, his verdict. The majority of the Court of Appeal decided, correctly in the circumstances, that the trial judge’s stereotypical reasoning had a material effect on the acquittal of the accused (see para. 61 and the heading for that paragraph).

 

 

 

Accordingly, we would dismiss the appeal and order a new trial.

                  Kasirer J. —

I.               Overview

[1]                             The outcome of this appeal turns on whether the Ontario courts should exercise jurisdiction over the merits of a custody dispute involving an international child abduction. The dispute stems from the wrongful retention in Ontario by the appellant, the “Mother”, of two very young children who habitually reside in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”). The children are retained in the province without the consent of the respondent, the “Father”, who remained in Dubai. What is at issue on appeal is not who, as between the parties, should be awarded the disputed custody rights in respect of the two children but instead which court — the Ontario court or a court in the UAE — should decide the matter.

[2]                             The proceedings commenced with an application for an order under s. 40 of the Children’s Law Reform Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.12 (“CLRA”), brought by the left‑behind parent. The Father has asked the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for an order to return the children to the UAE, a country that, unlike Canada, is not a party to the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, Can. T.S. 1983 No. 35 (“Hague Convention”). The Mother answered that she would not return to Dubai and asked the court to take up jurisdiction over custody on the merits.

[3]                             Where a child who is wrongfully removed to or retained in Ontario habitually resides in a country that is not a party to the Hague Convention, Ontario law provides that, but for exceptional circumstances, courts will refrain from exercising jurisdiction and leave the merits to the foreign jurisdiction with which the child has a closer connection. One such exception is set forth in s. 23 of the CLRA: a court can exercise jurisdiction to make a parenting order where a child is physically present in Ontario and, on a balance of probabilities, the court is convinced that the child would suffer “serious harm” if removed from the province.

[4]                             In opposing the application, the Mother recalls that, like her, the children are Canadian citizens. She says that these two young children would suffer serious harm if separated from her, their primary caregiver. The Mother also argues they would suffer serious harm because, under UAE law, custody would not be decided pursuant to the principle of the best interests of the child as understood in Ontario.

[5]                             After an 11‑day trial, the Ontario court declined jurisdiction because it was not satisfied that the children would suffer serious harm if sent home to Dubai. A majority of the Court of Appeal confirmed the return order. The dissenting judge was of the view that the trial judge had erred in his assessment of serious harm under s. 23 and that the Ontario court should exercise jurisdiction.

[6]                             In this Court, the Mother argues that the trial judge failed to properly identify and apply the best interests of the child principle to the relevant provisions of the CLRA. She says that the return of the young children to Dubai will necessarily separate them from her, their primary caregiver, because her residency status there is wholly dependent on the will and cooperation of the Father. This presents a plain risk of serious harm should these young children be ordered to return. Further, the gender inequality between mothers and fathers that characterizes UAE family law means that custody will not be decided there in accordance with the best interests of the children. By ordering the return of the children, the trial judge failed to apply the best interests principle based on the comprehensive measure set out in s. 24 of the CLRA, which should have led him to refuse the application given the serious harm return would cause to the children.

[7]                             The Mother is right to say that the lower courts were bound to apply the principle of the best interests of the child to the problem at hand and to do so from the child’s‑eye point of view. But she misconstrues, in my respectful view, how the Ontario legislature has directed courts to apply the best interests principle to the question of jurisdiction over children who are wrongfully retained in Ontario.

[8]                             Section 19 sets the objectives for the law relating to decision‑making responsibility and parenting time in Part III of the CLRA, including applications for the return of wrongfully removed children to countries party to the Hague Convention (s. 46(2)) and non‑Hague Convention countries (s. 40). In addition to discouraging child abduction, the legislature seeks to ensure that the child’s best interests are paramount to the making of ultimate parenting orders and that parenting determinations be made in the place to which the child has the closest connection, barring exceptional circumstances.

[9]                             The return order procedure in s. 40 of the CLRA thus starts from the premise that the best interests of the child are aligned with their prompt return to their habitual place of residence so as to minimize the harmful effects of child abduction. Returning the child to the jurisdiction with which they have the closest connection is also understood to be in the child’s best interests. The analysis of the jurisdictional questions contemplated in s. 40, including the risk of serious harm in s. 23, starts from this ordinary alignment of best interests and focuses on factors that would tend to establish, as an exception, serious harm if the child was returned. Contrary to the Mother’s position, the assessment is not a comprehensive comparison of the child’s life in the two jurisdictions or a broad-based best interests test as is conducted for a parenting order on the merits.

[10]                        The approach advocated for by the Mother risks conflating decisions on jurisdiction with custody decisions on the merits and would encourage forum‑shopping in future cases. This would reduce these decisions, as Hourigan J.A. wrote in the Court of Appeal, “to a means for Ontario courts to prefer this province’s system of justice over those of foreign jurisdictions under the guise of child safety” (2021 ONCA 614, 158 O.R. (3d) 481, at para. 79). Worse still, it would invite wrongful abductions to the province for the purpose of grounding jurisdiction there which, as Chamberland J.A. once wrote in a Quebec case, would encourage parents [translation] “to take the law into their own hands and go to another jurisdiction in the hope, whether conscious or not, that the courts there will be more receptive” (Droit de la famille — 3451, [1999] R.D.F. 641 (Que. C.A.), at p. 647, cited with approval in a non‑Hague Convention abduction case in Droit de la famille — 131294, 2013 QCCA 883, [2013] R.J.Q. 849, at para. 46). While the trial judge did not find in this case that the Mother’s disinclination to return was itself the cause of serious harm, it bears recalling that, in both Hague and non‑Hague Convention settings, the courts recognize that a parent should not be allowed to create a situation that is potentially harmful to the child and then rely upon it to establish a risk of harm to the child (see Ojeikere v. Ojeikere, 2018 ONCA 372, 140 O.R. (3d) 561, at para. 91). Finally, the Mother’s characterization of UAE law as an inherent source of serious harm must be rejected. Expert evidence accepted by the trial judge led him to conclude that the best interests principle would apply to the ultimate custody decision before a UAE court. As Hourigan J.A. observed, “the rather provincial view that unless Ontario law is applied, children will suffer serious harm” could have the unwitting effect of turning Ontario into a haven for child abduction (para. 83; see also para. 136, per Brown J.A., concurring).

[11]                        The trial judge was called upon to decide the fact‑specific, highly individualized question as to whether these two children would suffer serious harm if removed from Ontario. He understood that the separation of children from their primary caregiver typically gives rise to emotional distress for very young children. But he found, on the basis of the evidence, that this distress did not rise to the higher level of serious harm. Based on expert evidence relating to the differences between Ontario and UAE law, the judge determined the best interests of the two children will be the paramount consideration for determining custody in a UAE court. In the absence of a reviewable error, his decision that the serious harm threshold was not met is entitled to deference, as explained by the majority of the Court of Appeal. The custody dispute — undecided here — should be resolved by the courts in the UAE, where the children have their closest connection.

[12]                        Finally, I note the allegations of serious harm faced by the children in this case do not relate to domestic violence or abuse of any kind, but rather to the risk that the Mother, as primary caregiver, will be separated from the children should they be ordered home to Dubai where she has no independent residency status and does not wish to reside. The trial judge was aware of the risk of separation due to the precariousness of the Mother’s residency status. In making the return order, the judge took into account undertakings made by the Father in a “with prejudice” settlement offer that would alleviate that precariousness and thereby facilitate the Mother’s return with the children.

[13]                        Insofar as the Mother’s residency status presents a risk that she will be separated from the children, the undertakings would remove an obstacle to her return to Dubai, should she wish to do so. While undertakings made by a left-behind parent before the Ontario courts may present problems of enforceability before foreign courts, they are well-known and relied upon protective measures in international abduction cases around the world, including in this Court (Thomson v. Thomson, 1994 CanLII 26 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 551, at p. 599). Here, the undertakings that are directed at easing the Mother’s precarious residency status were, for the trial judge, protective measures that promoted the best interests of the children in the event that the Mother did decide to return. But at the end of the day, the trial judge found that whether or not the Mother returned, and independently of the undertakings, sending the children back home to Dubai would not cause them serious harm within the meaning of s. 23 and would be in their best interests. In this case, the judge did not rely on the view that the Mother’s conduct was the source of serious harm. Nor did he rely on the idea that the Mother was obliged to accept the Father’s offer to secure her residency status in Dubai.

[14]                        The terms of the Father’s offer also do more than just remove potential barriers to the Mother’s return. As Hourigan J.A. observed, the Father has also promised that the Mother will remain the primary residential parent, and that major parenting decisions will be made jointly by the two parents (para. 16). Further, the proposed settlement agreement would — if the Mother accepted it — see her retain custody of the children until they are 18, whether or not she chooses to remarry (A.R., vol. XI, at pp. 310‑11, cls. 3/1 and 3/2). The trial judge found that these promises could be made part of an enforceable order in the UAE courts.

[15]                        When the trial judge asked counsel to make submissions on how the Father’s undertakings could be incorporated into his order, the Mother did not follow up on the invitation. The Father has renewed his settlement offer before this Court. In her written argument, the Mother acknowledges the viability of protective measures to address her circumstances when she states that the trial judge should have required more forceful undertakings to answer the uncertainties surrounding her status in Dubai. Given that the judge took the Father’s undertakings into account but did not expressly record them in the order, I think it prudent to note that the order recognizes that the undertakings would assist the Mother should she wish to return to Dubai with the children. I would thus propose to confirm the return order and, in dismissing the appeal, acknowledge the undertakings relied upon in first instance.

II.            Background

[16]                        The Father is a citizen of Pakistan. He has been living in Dubai since 2008. The Mother moved with her family from Pakistan to Ontario in 2005, where she lived until 2012. She is a citizen of Pakistan and of Canada. In 2012, the Mother and the Father were married in Pakistan and then moved to Dubai, where the Father works in the banking sector. While the Mother has worked sporadically in Dubai, she does not have an independent residency status there. She has been sponsored by the Father throughout their marriage.

[17]                        The parties have two children, a girl, Z. (born in 2016, aged four at trial) and a boy, E. (born in 2019, who was about one at trial). Both children are Canadian citizens but, until they were brought to Ontario in June 2020, they had always been resident in Dubai. The Mother is their primary caregiver. Mary, the family’s live-in nanny, contributed significantly to their upbringing. In Dubai, the family lived comfortably. Their daughter Z. attended a well-regarded international school (2020 ONSC 7789, 475 C.R.R. (2d) 1, at para. 30).

[18]                        The parties experienced persistent marital difficulties.

[19]                        On June 19, 2020, the Mother travelled to Ontario with Z. and E. They left Dubai with return air tickets, ostensibly for a trip to visit her family. The Father, who remained in Dubai, agreed to that trip. On or about July 2, 2020, the Mother informed the Father that she intended to stay in Ontario with the children and not return to Dubai. The Father did not consent to the children remaining in Ontario and the Mother did not seek the authorization of a court to retain the children there.

[20]                        Shortly after learning of the Mother’s intentions, the Father initiated proceedings in Ontario seeking an order under s. 40 of the CLRA for the return of the two children to Dubai. He argued that the court should not take up jurisdiction to make a parenting order and that it was in the best interests of the children that all issues of custody and access be decided in the UAE.

[21]                        In response, the Mother said that custody and access should be decided in Ontario under the CLRA. She claimed that it was in the best interests of the children to remain in Ontario with her. The Mother filed submissions requesting sole custody. She depicted the Father as ill-tempered and aggressive and asked that he be granted limited access to the children (trial reasons, at paras. 20 and 70). The Mother also challenged the constitutionality of s. 40 para. 3 of the CLRA, arguing that it was ultra vires the legislative authority of the province and offended various guarantees under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

[22]                        In July 2020, the Father initiated divorce proceedings in Dubai, in which the Mother did not participate. In March 2021, the Father obtained a divorce in Dubai. Under UAE law, divorced non‑nationals are granted a one-year grace period during which they can remain in the country without a residency permit. The Mother’s grace period had expired by the time the Court heard this appeal in April 2022.

[23]                        Prior to the hearing of the s. 40 application, the Father presented a “with prejudice” settlement offer to the Mother’s counsel and filed it in court (trial reasons, at paras. 48‑49). He made a series of undertakings that could be included in the s. 40 order “as a condition of [the Mother] returning” to Dubai with the children (para. 49). In the offer, he undertook to ensure her independent residency in Dubai, in particular, by purchasing property for her in her name. He further undertook that the children reside primarily with her and that major decisions regarding them be made jointly. He wrote that the Mother would be free, should she wish, to contest the proposed custody and financial arrangements when the matter proceeded before the UAE court (see para. 49). The Father also incorporated by reference terms from a draft settlement agreement that he would propose to the UAE court (para. 49). In that draft settlement, the Father proposed to ensure that the Mother would retain custody of the children until they turned 18, whether or not the Mother chose to remarry. The Father stated that these terms could be included in a consent judgment issued by a UAE court. The Mother did not respond to this offer.

[24]                        At trial, both parties testified. The Father called an expert on family law in the UAE, Diana Hamade. The Mother called two experts: Elena Schildgen, an expert on family law in the UAE, and Carol‑Jane Parker, a registered psychotherapist, who provided evidence on the potential impact of separating young children from their primary caregivers.

[25]                        The trial judge had to resolve two issues: first, whether he should exercise jurisdiction for a parenting order on the merits; and second, if the court did not take up jurisdiction, whether to order the return of the children to Dubai pursuant to s. 40 of the CLRA.

III.         Proceedings Below

A.           Superior Court of Justice, 2020 ONSC 7789, 475 C.R.R. (2d) 1 (Conlan J.)

[26]                        The trial judge found that both the Mother and the Father were good, loving and caring parents, who never mistreated, abused or neglected their children (paras. 15 and 480). The Mother has always been the primary caregiver; Mary, the nanny, had helped substantially with the care of Z. and E. (paras. 262 and 291).

[27]                        As witnesses, the Father was “significantly more credible” than the Mother, who “was not a credible witness” (paras. 255‑56). The Mother’s evidence at trial was incompatible with the final order she was asking the court to make. On the one hand, she testified that she supported co-parenting — even joint custody — and, at a minimum, “lots of access” for the Father to the children (para. 281). However, her draft final order sought what the judge described as “anything but lots of access” for the Father (paras. 281‑82). The trial judge also noted inconsistencies in the Mother’s testimony (paras. 257‑74 and 277‑82). He did not accept the Mother’s claims of incidents of physical aggression (paras. 272‑74), or that she suffered religious discrimination and social isolation (para. 369), or her downplaying of the role that the long serving nanny, Mary, had with the children in Dubai.

[28]                        The trial judge accepted the entirety of the expert evidence of the Father, Ms. Hamade, who was “very experienced in the courts in the United Arab Emirates” and “fluent in the Arabic language in which the original relevant legislation was written” (para. 297). He accepted only a limited amount of Ms. Parker’s evidence, and some of the opinions expressed by the Mother’s expert, Ms. Schildgen, whose testimony on the state of UAE law was “devastating” for the Mother’s case (para. 293). The cross‑examination of Ms. Schildgen “eviscerated the very underpinning” of the Mother’s case, as it established that the best interests of the children would be the paramount consideration in any decision made regarding them in Dubai (para. 304).

[29]                        The trial judge assessed the entirety of the testimony he had heard. On the basis of that assessment, he made “four key findings” from the expert evidence (para. 294). On the foreign law, the best interests of Z. and E. would be the paramount consideration in determining custody in Dubai, and the settlement proposed by the Father, if agreed to by the Mother, could be incorporated into a valid court order in Dubai and would be enforceable. As to the consequences of a return of the children, he said the expert opinion established that children may face emotional and psychological repercussions from being separated from their primary caregiver. But as to what would occur with Z. and E., if separated from the Mother, the trial judge said that, based on the admissible evidence given by Ms. Parker, that specific effect remained unknown.

[30]                        After having reviewed the applicable legal principles, the trial judge determined that he should not assume jurisdiction under ss. 22 or 23 of the CLRA or under his parens patriae jurisdiction. He summarized his own findings in respect of the “serious harm” exception in s. 23 as follows:

(i)     there is no evidence at trial that Z. and E. are in any risk of being physically harmed if they return to Dubai;

(ii)   there is some circumstantial evidence at trial (through Ms. Parker and her opinions about infants, generally) that Z. and E. could be at risk of emotional and psychological harm if they are returned to Dubai without [the Mother];

(iii)   there is no evidence at trial about the views and preferences of the children;

(iv)   there is a claim by [the Mother] that she will not return to Dubai if the children are ordered to return there;

(v)   there is nothing else in the evidence at trial that this [c]ourt finds to be relevant to the serious harm assessment for Z. and E. . . .; and

(vi)   more specifically, considering the evidence of Ms. Hamade and Ms. Schildgen, there is a total absence of any reliable evidence at trial that the court system in Dubai will do anything other than (a) determine custody in accordance with the best interests of Z. and E., if contested; and (b) award custody to [the Mother], if contested, and (c) approve the settlement proposal tendered by [the Father], if agreed to by the [M]other. [Emphasis in original; para. 366.]

[31]                        He rejected the Mother’s argument that the children would suffer serious harm if they were returned because a court in Dubai would not “really employ a best interests of the child analysis” (para. 367 (emphasis deleted)). He placed “very little weight” on the assertion by the Mother that she would not return to Dubai, citing his earlier conclusions on credibility (para. 368).

[32]                        The trial judge accorded significant importance to the Father’s “with prejudice” offer (paras. 48‑49) and was of the view that Dubai courts would approve and enforce the settlement proposal tendered by the Father, if agreed to by the Mother (para. 366(vi); see also paras. 294 and 301). His conclusion was based on the expert evidence of Ms. Hamade, who, contrary to the Mother’s expert, was “intimately familiar with all aspects of [the Father’s] proposed settlement agreement” (para. 297; see also paras. 193‑94).

[33]                        While the trial judge recognized that young children, like Z. and E., can face negative emotional effects when separated from their primary caregiver (paras. 305 and 366(ii)), he determined that the anticipated risk did not rise to the required level of “serious harm”. The trial judge concluded that he could not exercise jurisdiction under s. 23 of the CLRA because he was not satisfied that Z. and E. would suffer serious harm if they were removed from Ontario (para. 370).

[34]                        Turning to the issue of whether the children should be returned to Dubai pursuant to s. 40 of the CLRA, he concluded that it was in the best interests of the children to do so, with or without the Mother (paras. 381 and 387). Recognizing that s. 40 provided him with broad discretionary powers and that he was not bound to order the return of the children, the trial judge wrote that it was the “only appropriate order” (para. 384). Dubai was their real home.

[35]                        The trial judge also dismissed the Mother’s challenge to the constitutional validity of s. 40 para. 3 of the CLRA (paras. 463‑64).

[36]                        He declared that the Mother had wrongfully retained the children in Ontario and ordered that they be returned to Dubai (para. 469). Lastly, before the order was finalized, and before the children would return to Dubai, he offered all parties the opportunity to make further submissions on whether to include the Father’s settlement proposal in the order (para. 472). The Mother did not avail herself of this opportunity.

B.            Court of Appeal, 2021 ONCA 614, 158 O.R. (3d) 481 (Lauwers, Hourigan and Brown JJ.A.)

[37]                        A majority of the court dismissed the appeal, confirming the trial judge’s order to return the children to Dubai. Hourigan J.A. wrote reasons on the jurisdictional issues. Brown J.A. wrote principally on the constitutional matters, which are not at issue before this Court. In dissent, Lauwers J.A. concluded the Superior Court of Justice had jurisdiction to make a parenting order based on s. 23 of the CLRA.

(1)        Hourigan J.A. (Brown J.A. Concurring)

[38]                        Recalling the applicable standard of review, Hourigan J.A. observed that the trial judge’s decision on serious harm was subject to deference on appeal. He dismissed the Mother’s argument on s. 23 as an inappropriate invitation to reweigh evidence settled at trial. The trial judge was aware of the Mother’s precarious residency status and the resulting risk of separation. For Hourigan J.A., the trial judge was entitled to rely on the expert evidence and conclude that there were workable solutions for the Mother to obtain her residency, noting that the Mother declined to make submissions on the Father’s settlement offer. The trial judge considered the expert evidence and it was open to him to conclude that an agreement between the parties could be incorporated in a court order (C.A. reasons, at paras. 62‑63). He disagreed with the dissenting judge’s view that the trial judge failed to consider the possibility that the Father would renege on the offer and seek to limit the Mother’s access to the children. “Perhaps the one indisputable fact established on the record”, wrote Hourigan J.A., “was that the [Mother], not the [Father], sought to limit access to the children” (para. 71).

[39]                        Moreover, the trial judge was aware of the inconsistencies between UAE and Canadian law, but properly focussed on whether these discrepancies would cause serious harm to the children. No reviewable error was shown. To say that the discrepancies did ground jurisdiction in Ontario would send a message that parents in the UAE could remove children to the province and not be required to send them home (para. 83).

[40]                        Hourigan J.A. then turned to the trial judge’s assessment of whether the separation of the children from their primary caregiver presented a risk of serious harm. Based on the expert evidence, the trial judge could fairly conclude that the children might be at risk of emotional or psychological damage if separated from the Mother, but that the threshold for serious harm had not been met (para. 91). It would be mistaken to assume that whenever young children are separated from their primary caregiver there will always be a risk of serious harm, regardless of the circumstances of each case (paras. 92‑94). This would serve to encourage child abduction, unduly focus the analysis on the preferences of the custodial parent (rather than the best interests of the child) and undermine the individualized nature of the serious harm inquiry. Again, Hourigan J.A. found no basis for disturbing the trial judge’s conclusion.

(2)        Brown J.A. (Hourigan J.A. Concurring)

[41]                        In concurring reasons, Brown J.A. dismissed the Mother’s grounds of appeal regarding the constitutional challenge. Although this Court did not grant the Mother’s motion for leave to argue the constitutional issues, Brown J.A.’s explanation of the purposes of s. 40 of the CLRA is useful to the jurisdictional questions that remain in dispute.

[42]                        Brown J.A. observed that return orders made under s. 40 para. 3 share the same purposes as those made under the Hague Convention, that is, “to protect a child from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention and to return a child wrongfully removed or retained to the jurisdiction which is most appropriate for the determination of custody and access” (para. 131). Brown J.A. also noted that the scope of a best interests inquiry under s. 40 para. 3 differs from that undertaken when custody is at issue under s. 24. When determining whether to return children to a different jurisdiction, a court must also consider the CLRA’s other policy objectives, such as discouraging the abduction of children and avoiding concurrent exercises of jurisdiction (para. 186). On the facts of this case, he was satisfied that the trial judge performed the multi-factored analysis required by s. 40 para. 3 of the CLRA, and that his findings of fact supported the conclusion that the return of the children to Dubai was in their best interests (paras. 189‑90).

(3)        Lauwers J.A. (Dissenting)

[43]                        For Lauwers J.A., the trial judge erred, both in law and in fact, when he concluded that the return of the children would not expose them to serious harm. He would have applied the exception in s. 23, set aside the return order and directed the Ontario Superior Court take up jurisdiction to make a parenting order.

[44]                        In this case, the children will be separated from their Mother because of her precarious residency status in Dubai. The separation of young children from their primary caregiver constitutes, in itself, a risk of serious harm (para. 291). The trial judge committed a palpable and overriding error when he wrote that the impact of the involuntary separation was “unknown”. This was precisely the issue the judge had to determine under s. 23 (para. 287).

[45]                        The Father’s contingent undertakings do not effectively mitigate the Mother’s precariousness in Dubai where she has no independent legal right to reside (paras. 297‑302). The trial judge failed to consider whether the undertakings would be enforceable in Dubai, and he could not rely on the Father’s credibility at trial to presume that he will honour the proposals he made (para. 302). If the Father was to rescind the proposal, UAE law would govern the dispute between the parties. The automatic assignment of decision‑making on the basis of gender under UAE law is a pronounced departure from Ontario’s understanding of the best interests of the child. Together, these interrelated factors amount to serious harm for the children (paras. 312‑18).

IV.         Issues

[46]                        The Mother’s appeal raises two principal issues.

[47]                        First, she says the trial judge erred by declining to take up jurisdiction of the custody dispute on the merits. He wrongly concluded that jurisdiction could not be founded on s. 23 of the CLRA. Specifically, he erred in ignoring factors that, if properly considered, would have satisfied the test for serious harm.

[48]                        Second, she says the trial judge erred in ordering that the children should be returned to Dubai pursuant to s. 40 para. 3 of the CLRA. He wrongly rejected a broad-based best interests analysis that should guide the decision whether or not to issue a return order. Further, the trial judge should have made an interim parenting order maintaining the children in her care until a mechanism was put in place to assure, in particular, that property was purchased in her name to guarantee her residency status.

V.           Analysis

A.           Child Abduction in Ontario and Jurisdictional Issues

[49]                          Whether or not the dispute involves a country that is a party to the Hague Convention, when a child is wrongfully removed from their habitual residence and brought to Ontario, courts will, as a general rule, decline to exercise jurisdiction over the merits of the custody dispute and order that the child be returned home. This reflects a legislative policy expressed in s. 19 for the whole of Part III of the CLRA. Through this policy, the legislature seeks to discourage child abductions and the wrongful removal and retention of children to Ontario as well as to ensure that parenting matters are determined by the jurisdiction to which the child has a closer connection.

[50]                          Ontario sees the policy of discouraging child abduction as aligned with the principle of the best interests of the child. This finds expression in the province’s acceptance of Canada’s adherence to the Hague Convention, pursuant to s. 46(2) of the CLRA. The Hague Convention endeavours to protect children from the harmful effects of removal or retention of a child in breach of the left‑behind parent’s custody rights and also seeks to establish procedures to ensure the prompt return of children to the country of their habitual residence (see, e.g., Thomson, at pp. 575‑76; Office of the Children’s Lawyer v. Balev, 2018 SCC 16, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 398, at paras. 22‑24; Droit de la famille — 15751, 2015 QCCA 638, at para. 17 (CanLII)). Parties to the Hague Convention recognize that they share the legal principle that “the interests of children are of paramount importance in matters relating to their custody” (Hague Convention, preamble; see also Geliedan v. Rawdah, 2020 ONCA 254, 446 D.L.R. (4th) 440, at para. 37).

[51]                          When children are wrongfully removed from non‑party states and brought to Ontario or another Canadian province or territory, the Hague Convention does not apply. To address international abductions falling outside the scope of the Hague Convention, Canadian provinces and territories have enacted various statutory regimes (see, e.g., Family Law Act, S.B.C. 2011, c. 25 (British Columbia); Extra-Provincial Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. E‑14 (Alberta); The Children’s Law Act, 2020, S.S. 2020, c. 2 (Saskatchewan); on the application of the Civil Code of Québec to non‑Hague Convention cases, see Droit de la famille — 131294). In Ontario, the relevant rules are found in Part III of the CLRA.

[52]                          A review of legislation in this area reveals that, in general, Canadian provinces treat child abductions in non‑Hague Convention cases in a manner methodologically comparable to the Convention: first, by declining to decide parental disputes on the merits with respect to children who do not habitually reside in the province or territory, and second, by favouring the return of children to the jurisdiction of their habitual residence. However, these similarities do not mean that an application brought under provincial legislation is treated the same way as one brought subject to the rules of the Hague Convention (Geliedan, at paras. 26‑34).

[53]                          In Thomson, a Hague Convention case, this Court clarified that the legislation governing non‑Hague and Hague Convention disputes “operate independently of one another” (p. 603; see also L.S.I. v. G.P.I., 2011 ONCA 623, 285 O.A.C. 111, at para. 46). As pointed out by Laskin J.A. in Ojeikere, in Hague Convention cases, “Ontario courts can have confidence that whatever jurisdiction decides on a child’s custody it will do so on the basis of the child’s best interests”, but they cannot have the same confidence in cases involving non‑party jurisdictions (para. 60; see also Geliedan, at paras. 37‑38 and 45). The Ontario legislature makes plain, in s. 19(a) of the CLRA, that the ultimate determination of a parenting order on the merits will be made on the basis of the best interests of the child. To account for the fact that, in the non‑Hague Convention context, Ontario courts do not benefit from the a priori assumption that the best interests of the child principle will be applied to the merits of the custody dispute in the foreign country, judges assessing petitions for return to non‑party jurisdictions must therefore consider the tenor of foreign law, generally through expert evidence adduced by the parties. Nevertheless, in Thomson, La Forest J. explained that it is not improper to look at the Hague Convention for the interpretation of domestic legislation, “since the legislature’s adoption of the Convention is indicative of the legislature’s judgment that international child custody disputes are best resolved by returning the child to its habitual place of residence” (p. 603; for the CLRA, see N. Bala, “O.C.L. v. Balev: Not an ‘Evisceration’ of the Hague Convention and the International Custody Jurisdiction of the CLRA” (2019), 38 C.F.L.Q. 301, at p. 308).

[54]                          The children in this case have been removed from the UAE, a state which is not a party to the Hague Convention. It follows that this matter should be resolved on the basis of the general provisions of Part III of the CLRA.

B.            The Statutory Scheme in Ontario

[55]                        Part III of the CLRA sets out the provisions concerning orders for decision‑making responsibility and parenting time made by Ontario courts under the law of Ontario.[1] An Ontario court will not make a “parenting order” unless it has jurisdiction to do so. Section 22 concerns jurisdiction over a child habitually resident in Ontario or a child physically present in Ontario where, in particular, substantial evidence concerning the best interests of the child is available in the province. Moreover, a court may exercise its parens patriae jurisdiction, preserved by s. 69.

[56]                          An Ontario court can also exercise its jurisdiction if the child would suffer serious harm as a result of being removed from Ontario. On appeal to this Court, the Mother relies only on s. 23 as the basis for the Ontario court’s jurisdiction:

23 Despite sections 22 and 41, a court may exercise its jurisdiction to make or to vary a parenting order or contact order with respect to a child if,

 

(a) the child is physically present in Ontario; and

 

(b) the court is satisfied that the child would, on the balance of probabilities, suffer serious harm if,

 

(i) the child remains with a person legally entitled to decision‑making responsibility with respect to the child,

 

(ii) the child is returned to a person legally entitled to decision‑making responsibility with respect to the child, or

 

(iii) the child is removed from Ontario.

[57]                          Within Part III, ss. 40 to 46 of the CLRA bear on “Decision-Making Responsibility, Parenting Time and Contact — Extra-Provincial Matters”. Section 40, the provision upon which the Father relies in this case, applies to the application for the return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in Ontario when those children are not subject to the Hague Convention. It provides:

40 Upon application, a court,

 

(a) that is satisfied that a child has been wrongfully removed to or is being wrongfully retained in Ontario; or

 

(b) that may not exercise jurisdiction under section 22 or that has declined jurisdiction under section 25 or 42,

 

may do any one or more of the following:

 

1. Make such interim parenting order or contact order as the court considers is in the best interests of the child.

 

2. Stay the application subject to,

 

i. the condition that a party to the application promptly commence a similar proceeding before an extra-provincial tribunal, or

 

ii. such other conditions as the court considers appropriate.

 

3. Order a party to return the child to such place as the court considers appropriate and, in the discretion of the court, order payment of the cost of the reasonable travel and other expenses of the child and any parties to or witnesses at the hearing of the application.

[58]                          Finally, s. 19 states the purposes of the whole of Part III — including the rules in s. 40 and the rules on jurisdiction, such as s. 23:

19 The purposes of this Part are,

 

(a) to ensure that applications to the courts respecting decision‑making responsibility, parenting time, contact and guardianship with respect to children will be determined on the basis of the best interests of the children;

 

(b) to recognize that the concurrent exercise of jurisdiction by judicial tribunals of more than one province, territory or state in relation to the determination of decision‑making responsibility with respect to the same child ought to be avoided, and to make provision so that the courts of Ontario will, unless there are exceptional circumstances, refrain from exercising or decline jurisdiction in cases where it is more appropriate for the matter to be determined by a tribunal having jurisdiction in another place with which the child has a closer connection;

 

(c) to discourage the abduction of children as an alternative to the determination of decision‑making responsibility by due process; and

 

(d) to provide for the more effective enforcement of parenting orders and contact orders, and for the recognition and enforcement of orders made outside Ontario that grant decision‑making responsibility, parenting time or contact with respect to a child.

[59]                          In sum, parents whose children have been abducted from a non‑party country can apply for their return pursuant to s. 40 of the CLRA. Unless the abducting parent demonstrates that Ontario courts should make parenting orders on any one of the four bases outlined above (ss. 22(1)(a) or (b) or 23, or parens patriae jurisdiction), the courts should decline to exercise jurisdiction with respect to a child (Ojeikere, at para. 12; E. (H.) v. M. (M.), 2015 ONCA 813, 393 D.L.R. (4th) 267, at paras. 22‑26). In this case, all that remains in dispute before this Court is whether s. 23 applies such that the Ontario courts should take jurisdiction over the merits of the dispute and, accordingly, refuse the Father’s application for the return of the children to Dubai.

C.            Jurisdiction and the Best Interests of the Child

[60]                          This case invites the Court to clarify the role the best interests of the child principle plays in the interpretation and application of the CLRA’s jurisdictional rules. The Mother argues that where jurisdiction is premised on the “serious harm” exception, judges must undertake a broad-based best interests analysis, having regard to the factors set out in s. 24(3) (A.F., at para. 10). The Father answers that s. 23 already reflects an overriding concern for the best interests of children. He says that courts should not embark on a broad-based best interests analysis like the one conducted when deciding custody on the merits (R.F., at paras. 97‑99).

[61]                          The Mother is not mistaken to point to the importance of the best interests of the child principle. As a general rule in Canadian family law, it is undoubtedly the case that the best interests of the children are the paramount consideration for all decisions that concern children and that best interests are measured from the child’s perspective (see, e.g., Young v. Young, 1993 CanLII 34 (SCC), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 3; Ontario (Children’s Lawyer) v. Ontario (Information and Privacy Commissioner), 2018 ONCA 559, 141 O.R. (3d) 481, at para. 58; Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law v. Canada (Attorney General), 2004 SCC 4, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 76, at para. 9). This is no less true in matters of international abduction, whatever the child’s country of origin, and whether or not the Hague Convention governs the dispute.

[62]                          That said, the Mother’s submissions misapprehend the manner in which the CLRA would have the best interests principle apply to ss. 40 and 23. The legislature’s overriding concern for upholding the best interests of the child principle is encoded in the rules of the CLRA (Ojeikere, at para. 17). Under the statutory scheme, the best interests test calls for a “differing application” in questions of jurisdiction and determinations on the merits (C.A. reasons, at para. 187, per Brown J.A.). On the one hand, when Ontario courts are called upon to make parenting or contact orders on the merits, the best interests of the child are to be comprehensively assessed in light of the factors listed in s. 24 of the CLRA. On the other hand, when courts determine whether Ontario should decline jurisdiction in favour of foreign courts and return children, they are deciding, fundamentally, which court will decide on custody, not custody itself. I agree with Brown J.A.’s explanation: “[the children’s] immediate legal interests concern where the issue of their custody should be determined, not who should have custody”, he wrote, and “[t]he best interests test must be applied in that context” (para. 187).

[63]                          As counsel for the Attorney General of Ontario explain in their helpful factum, the CLRA presumes, following an abduction, that the child’s best interests are aligned with their prompt return to the jurisdiction of their habitual residence unless there are exceptional circumstances that justify Ontario courts taking up jurisdiction (I.F., at para. 6).

[64]                          The premise that the children’s best interests are favoured by their timely return to their home jurisdiction is sound. Child abductions harm children (Balev, at paras. 23‑25; Ojeikere, at para. 16; A. Grammaticaki‑Alexiou, “Best Interests of the Child in Private International Law”, in Collected Courses of the Hague Academy of International Law (2020), vol. 412, 253, at p. 325). As McLachlin C.J. explained in Balev, “[t]he children are removed from their home environments and often from contact with the other parents. They may be transplanted into a culture with which they have no prior ties, with different social structures, school systems, and sometimes languages. Dueling custody battles waged in different countries may follow, delaying resolution of custody issues. None of this is good for children or parents” (para. 23). Moreover, resolving parenting issues in the children’s home jurisdiction fosters stability, while ensuring that custody will be determined by the authorities of the place with which the child has the closer connection, which is an objective set out under s. 19 of the CLRA. Indeed, the jurisdiction from which the children have been removed is usually in the best position to determine which arrangement will be in their best interests (Bolla v. Swart, 2017 ONSC 1488, 92 R.F.L. (7th) 362, at para. 38; W.D.N. v. O.A., 2019 ONCJ 926, 35 R.F.L. (8th) 190, at para. 51; Droit de la famille — 131294, at para. 110). This is explained by the fact that “the courts of the child’s State of habitual residence . . . generally will have fuller and easier access to the information and evidence” relevant to making a “comprehensive best interests’ assessment” (Hague Conference on Private International Law, 1980 Child Abduction Convention — Guide to Good Practice, Part VI, Article 13(1)(b) (2020) (“Guide”), at para. 15; see also J. M. Eekelaar, “International Child Abduction by Parents” (1982), 32 U.T.L.J. 281, at p. 301).

[65]                          Consequently, at the preliminary stage of deciding jurisdiction, it is not the role of the judge to conduct a broad-based best interests inquiry, as they would on the merits of a custody application. Instead, the judge must determine if the court should exercise jurisdiction on the basis of any of the four grounds listed above. If one of the four grounds is made out, the presumption that it is in the children’s best interests to decline jurisdiction and order their return will be rebutted. One such exceptional circumstance is the s. 23 basis for jurisdiction, where there is a risk of serious harm should the child be removed from Ontario.

[66]                          Under s. 23 of the CLRA, the court may exercise its jurisdiction if the abducting parent proves, on a balance of probabilities, that the child would suffer serious harm if removed from Ontario. If serious harm is established, it will be in the child’s best interests for the Ontario court to assume jurisdiction and decide on custody on the merits. Simply put, the presumption in favour of the jurisdiction of habitual residence must give way to the imperative of protecting a child when serious harm is made out.

[67]                          Thus, when deciding whether to exercise jurisdiction under s. 23, judges should not conduct a broad-based best interests analysis, but should rather conduct an individualized assessment of the risk of serious harm. This is also in keeping with the expeditious character of the proceedings associated with an application for a return order which, as this Court noted in Balev, serves to reduce the harmful effects of removal upon the child and the left‑behind parent (paras. 25‑27 and 88‑89). I agree with the Attorney General of Ontario that replacing the serious harm threshold with a broad‑based best interests assessment would conflate the question of jurisdiction with the making of parenting orders and inappropriately dilute the threshold of serious harm (I.F., at paras. 3 and 17). In so doing, it would risk removing “the presumption of a timely return, resulting in Ontario courts exercising jurisdiction in most cases of wrongful abduction or retention” (I.F., at para. 3). In this sense, the Mother’s argument that the s. 23 analysis requires a broad‑based best interests analysis ignores the fundamental distinction between jurisdictional issues and determinations on the merits. It ultimately undermines the purpose of the serious harm exception, that is, to ensure decisions on the merits are made by the appropriate authority in accordance with the best interests of the children (see s. 19(a) and (b)).

[68]                          There is, of course, no doubt that an individualized serious harm analysis may overlap with a full best interests analysis. For instance, many of the best interests factors enumerated under s. 24(3) of the CLRA, which are to be applied when “making a parenting order or contact order”, may also inform a serious harm inquiry, depending on the circumstances of a given case (see, e.g., Ojeikere, at para. 107, per Miller J.A., concurring). However, the best interests factors provided under s. 24 of the CLRA will only be relevant to the extent that they contribute to establishing serious harm, contrary to the broad‑based exercise that s. 24 contemplates for “making a parenting order or contact order” (s. 24(1)). For example, the presence of “family violence”, a factor listed under s. 24(3)(j), could well be relevant to establish serious harm under s. 23 (see, e.g., S. (D.M.) v. S. (C.L.), 2016 BCSC 1551, 91 R.F.L. (7th) 202, at paras. 51‑53; E. (H.), at paras. 122‑25). By contrast, a court may feel that it would be in the child’s best interests that they attend a highly reputable school, but this factor would be unlikely to have weight in a serious harm inquiry.

D.           Serious Harm

(1)         Defining the Scope of the Serious Harm Exception

[69]                        The onus to prove that the child would suffer serious harm rests on the abducting parent (Onuoha v. Onuoha, 2021 ONSC 2228, 54 R.F.L. (8th) 1, at para. 23, aff’g 2020 ONSC 6849, 49 R.F.L. (8th) 115). The burden is demanding. It is not enough to identify a “serious risk” of harm: the court must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the harm itself would be serious in nature. This high threshold is necessary to ensure that the legislative purposes of discouraging child abductions and avoiding concurrent jurisdiction are properly served. It is not enough to conclude that the return would have a negative impact on the child.

[70]                        Serious harm inquiries are child‑centered. As La Forest J. wrote in Thomson, building upon this Court’s decision in Young, “from a child centered perspective, harm is harm. If the harm were severe enough to meet the stringent test of the Convention, it would be irrelevant from whence it came” (p. 597). One implication of this focus is that, as a general rule, return orders should not become a vehicle for punishing the abducting parent. The relevance of the abducting parent’s conduct is assessed from the child’s point of view.

[71]                        When conducting their s. 23 analysis, judges should consider both the likelihood and the severity of the anticipated harm (Ojeikere, at para. 62). The measure of s. 23 is highly factual and, as the Court of Appeal pointed out, is discretionary, in the sense that it involves the weighing of various factors (para. 52; Ojeikere, at para. 63; E. (H.), at para. 29; Volgemut v. Decristoforo, 2021 ONSC 7382, at para. 99 (CanLII); Ajayi v. Ajayi, 2022 ONSC 5268, 473 D.L.R. (4th) 609, at para. 20). Serious harm may be established through a single consideration or may arise from a combination of factors, given the holistic nature of the assessment mandated by s. 23 (C.A. reasons, at para. 140, per Brown J.A.; see also Ojeikere, at para. 63).

[72]                        The analysis is also highly individualized. It should focus on the particular circumstances of the child, rather than on a general assessment of the society to which they are sent back. As was held in Onuoha (2021), regarding a request for return of two children to Nigeria, “[r]educed opportunities, undesirable social conditions compared to conditions in Canada, and inferior economic conditions are not, by themselves, a basis for finding that the children would suffer ‘serious harm’ if returned” (para. 18; see also para. 32; M. (R.A.) v. M. (Y.Y.), 2005 BCPC 259, 48 Imm. L.R. (3d) 301). While this may be relevant on the merits of custody proceedings, judges should not, in deciding jurisdiction, compare the living conditions that each country may offer.

[73]                        The stringency of the standard of “serious harm” under s. 23 may usefully be compared with that of the Hague Convention’s grave risk of harm or intolerable situation provided for in Article 13(1)(b) of the Hague Convention (Ojeikere, at para. 53). Under Article 13(1)(b), only situations that an individual child should not be expected to tolerate meet the threshold that would be a defence to the principle of automatic return (Guide, at para. 34). The Court of Appeal for Ontario has helpfully explained that the s. 23 standard is less exacting than that of the Hague Convention (Ojeikere, at para. 58; A. (M.A.) v. E. (D.E.M.), 2020 ONCA 486, 152 O.R. (3d) 81, at para. 43). In Ojeikere, Laskin J.A. observed that the main reason for this lower standard is the difference in language between the two provisions (para. 59). The words “intolerable situation” in Article 13(1)(b) of the Hague Convention are absent from s. 23, and, “[a]s a matter of statutory interpretation, the legislature must be taken to have intended not to use these uncompromising words to qualify ‘serious harm’” (Ojeikere, at para. 59). Significantly, Laskin J.A. added that the s. 23 standard should be less stringent because signatories of the Hague Convention can rely on their reciprocal recognition that the ultimate custody decision will be based on the best interests principle (para. 60). The Court of Appeal for Ontario has also recently noted that even the Article 13(1)(b) analysis “is not meant to become an in-depth analysis of the parties’ history” (Leigh v. Rubio, 2022 ONCA 582, 75 R.F.L. (8th) 251, at para. 25). Accordingly, proceedings dealing with Article 13(1)(b) should — like those based on s. 23 of the CLRA — be resolved “quickly and efficiently” (Leigh, at para. 2).

[74]                        The “serious harm” exception is often invoked in cases where children face a risk of emotional or physical abuse. Courts have, in particular, found sufficient evidence to justify the s. 23 exception based on proof of physical and psychological harm (A. (M.A.), at para. 58; Aldush v. Alani, 2022 ONSC 1536, 74 R.F.L. (8th) 113, at para. 117). But s. 23 is not limited to those circumstances. Ojeikere provided a non‑exhaustive list of considerations that can serve as useful guidelines in assessing whether serious harm arises, although they do not encompass the wide variety of circumstances in which such a risk exists: the risk of physical harm; the risk of psychological harm; the views of the children; and the parent’s claim that they would not return to the habitual residence even if the children were required to do so (para. 64). The rules applicable to deciding custody in the foreign jurisdiction may be another relevant factor when assessing serious harm.

[75]                          Given the discretionary, individualized and fact‑specific character of the serious harm analysis, a trial judge’s findings are owed deference. I agree with Hourigan J.A. that the policy rationales supporting deference in family matters, set out in Hickey v. Hickey, 1999 CanLII 691 (SCC), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 518, and Van de Perre v. Edwards, 2001 SCC 60, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 1014, apply equally to the jurisdictional question under s. 23 (para. 38). Indeed, this Court has itself recently underscored the vital importance of appellate deference in family law matters, following the approach articulated in Hickey and Van de Perre, in Barendregt v. Grebliunas, 2022 SCC 22, at para. 103. Martin J. likewise explained, for a unanimous Court in B.J.T. v. J.D., 2022 SCC 24, at paras. 52‑53 and 55‑59, that deference on appeal is justified by an institutional difference between trial and appellate courts, where the former hear the parties directly. These justifications apply with equal force in the jurisdictional context of the s. 23 analysis because of the very character of the “serious harm” evaluation. Accordingly, appellate courts cannot set aside a trial judge’s conclusion on serious harm simply on the basis that they would have weighed the evidence differently.

(a)           Separation of Children From Their Primary Caregiver

[76]                        The prospect of separation of children from their primary caregiver, recognized in the last Ojeikere factor, raises the question of whether separation can pose a risk to the child’s psychological well‑being rising to the level of serious harm. The issue is particularly pressing in the case of young children with an established dependence on their primary caregiver parent who, as in this case, is the abductor and who is unable or unwilling to return. The majority of the Court of Appeal concluded that serious harm does not automatically arise whenever young children are separated from their primary caregiver (paras. 92‑94). Lauwers J.A., in dissent, was of the view that serious harm is established as soon as the court is convinced, on a balance of probabilities, that an “indefinite” separation between infants and their primary caregiver will occur (para. 291). Relying upon the dissenting reasons, the Mother argues before this Court that the trial judge erred in concluding that separation between children and their primary caregiver does not constitute serious harm within the meaning of s. 23 of the CLRA (A.F., at paras. 67 and 82).

[77]                        Separating an infant from their primary caregiver is a circumstance that most certainly can cause psychological harm to the child. It should never be considered lightly, given “the particular role and emotional bonding the child enjoys” with their primary caregiver (Gordon v. Goertz, 1996 CanLII 191 (SCC), [1996] 2 S.C.R. 27, at para. 121, per L’Heureux‑Dubé J.). I accept, as well, that a child’s loss of contact with a primary caregiver who cannot return to the home jurisdiction, for reasons beyond their control, can be the source of serious harm for an infant.

[78]                        But I reject the argument that such a separation, in and of itself and without regard to the individualized circumstances, will always rise to the level required under s. 23. As Hourigan J.A. wrote, this could ultimately defeat the legislative objective of discouraging child abductions of very young children (paras. 93‑94; see also Jamali v. Gillani, 2021 BCSC 2134, at para. 101 (CanLII)). In order to deter and remedy child abductions effectively, courts should be prepared, in some circumstances, to order the return of the children despite a risk of separation from their primary caregiver. Deciding otherwise could allow abducting parents, in some situations, to rely on their status as primary caregivers to circumvent the due process for custody determination and remove the children from the authority of the courts that would normally have jurisdiction. This could ultimately risk making Ontario a haven for child abductions.

[79]                        In Thomson, this Court explicitly endorsed the idea expressed in Re A. (A Minor) (Abduction), [1988] 1 F.L.R. 365 (Eng. C.A.), that “the risk has to be . . . something greater than would normally be expected on taking a child away from one parent and passing him to another” (p. 597; see also Ojeikere, at para. 56). In Bolla, Harvison Young J. (as she was then) correctly relied on this passage to conclude that the “harm” contemplated in s. 23 must be more than just the risk of harm resulting from being separated from their primary caregiver (para. 137; see also S.A.G. v. C.D.G., 2009 YKSC 21, at paras. 21 and 27 (CanLII)).

[80]                        The analysis of harm associated with separation under s. 23 must be individualized and based on evidence specific to the child involved (Ojeikere, at para. 92). The child’s age, and, where relevant, their special needs and vulnerabilities, may mitigate or aggravate the risk of harm (see, e.g., Hage v. Bryntwick, 2014 ONSC 4104, at para. 63 (CanLII)). Moreover, expert evidence accepted by the trial judge in this case shows that the relationship between a child and their known alternate caregiver and the left‑behind parent, as well as the environment to which a child will be returned, may also affect how an abducted child responds to the separation from their primary caregiver (trial reasons, at para. 309). Therefore, if a child is separated from their primary caregiver, but is nevertheless returned to their capable left‑behind parent and other known caregivers, in a safe and familiar environment, the high threshold of harm may not be met (for the Hague Convention, see Guide, at paras. 64‑65). Conversely, if the evidence demonstrates that the child would be returned to an environment where they will be left without care or that they feel unsafe with their alternate caregiver, it is very possible that the serious harm threshold will be met (see, e.g., Aldush, at para. 158).

[81]                        When assessing the severity of the harm, judges should also consider whether undertakings made by the left‑behind parent to the primary caregiver in the proceedings — also called “protective measures” — could be joined to the return order made pursuant to s. 40 of the CLRA in order to lift the obstacles to the parent’s return or to address any other aspect of the anticipated risk of harm to the child (for the Hague Convention, see Guide, at paras. 36‑37 and 64‑66; see also R. Schuz, The Hague Child Abduction Convention: A Critical Analysis (2013), at pp. 291‑92; P. R. Beaumont and P. E. McEleavy, The Hague Convention on International Child Abduction (1999), at pp. 156‑57; for non‑Hague Convention disputes in Ontario, see Bolla). These could include, for example, an undertaking from the left‑behind parent to facilitate daily contact between the abducting parent and the child or to attend to financial or administrative obstacles to the primary caregiver’s return (see, e.g., P. (J.) v. P. (T.N.), 2016 ABQB 613, 90 R.F.L. (7th) 211, at paras. 52‑60). Of course, protective measures only attenuate the risk of harm if there is satisfactory evidence that they would be respected and enforceable in the foreign jurisdiction (Schuz (2013), at p. 292). I will address the role of undertakings within s. 40 orders in greater detail below.

[82]                        As to the likelihood of separation, courts should consider all barriers to the return of the primary caregiver. In some cases, the risk of separation will be involuntary, namely when the primary caregiver faces definitive legal obstacles to their return. It may also be voluntary, in the sense that it flows from the parent’s refusal to return. In general, a parent ought not to be able to create serious harm and then rely on it through their own refusal to return (Ojeikere, at para. 91; see also Schuz (2013), at pp. 280‑81; Guide, at para. 72). Accordingly, courts should carefully scrutinize refusals to return when there is no impediment to the parent re-entering and remaining in the country of the child’s habitual residence (see, e.g., Ajayi, at para. 28). In discussing harm caused by separation from a primary caregiver who is the abductor under the Hague Convention, scholar Rhona Schuz observes:

An obvious strategy for a primary carer abductor is to state that she is not prepared to return with the child and that the consequent separation from her will cause the child psychological harm. Such claims are almost invariably rejected by most courts . . . .

 

((2013), at p. 280, relying on C. v. C. (Minor: Abduction: Rights of Custody Abroad), [1989] 2 All E.R. 465 (C.A.), at p. 471.)

This is not a matter of blaming the taking parent for their refusal to return which, as I note below, may be justified. Courts and commentators who reject allegations of harm in these circumstances are recognizing that the refusal to return, where not justified, is not in the best interests of the child. As a general rule, these best interests are served by contact with both parents, and a stable and familiar home environment. The presumption remains that abduction from their habitual residence can be the source of distress that is contrary to the child’s welfare.

[83]                        This is not to say that a primary caregiver’s refusal to return will always be taken to be unjustified. An abducting parent may have legitimate and reasonable reasons for not returning to the foreign country, such as significant obstacles to employment or risks to safety, including evidence showing that the left-behind parent is responsible for child abuse or intimate partner violence to the primary caregiver (see, e.g., Ojeikere, at para. 91; Aldush, at para. 149; B. Hale, “Taking Flight — Domestic Violence and Child Abduction” (2017), 70 Current Legal Problems 3; N. Bala and J. Chamberland, “Family Violence and Proving ‘Grave Risk’ for Cases Under the Hague Convention Article 13(b)”, Queen’s Law Research Paper No. 91 (2017), at p. 6). That said, as a general matter, an unreasonable refusal to return cannot be said to be in the child’s best interests: the law requires that parents set aside their differences, and facilitate contact between the child and their estranged partner. The mere fact of undertaking the wrongful abduction suggests an abductor has lost sight of that idea; the subsequent refusal to return, where not reasonably justified, makes further contact between the child and the left‑behind parent difficult. Again, while this is not about punishing or blaming the taking parent, it is nonetheless true that this may be a consideration to bear in mind when examining the serious harm exception in s. 23 of the CLRA (see, e.g., Onuoha (2020), at para. 128). It should be noted, however, that the trial judge in this case did not state that a possible choice not to return by the Mother would be unjustified. Instead, he considered the effects flowing from a possible separation, whatever the cause, and decided, at the end of the day, that it was in the children’s best interests to return to their home in Dubai (paras. 381 and 387‑90).

(b)         Foreign Law as a Source of Serious Harm

[84]                        The Court must also examine whether inconsistencies between family law in the foreign jurisdiction and in Ontario should factor in a serious harm analysis. Lauwers J.A., dissenting in the court below, stated his view that the UAE’s conception of the best interests of the child is incompatible with Ontario’s equal entitlement to decision‑making responsibility recognized in s. 20(1) of the CLRA (paras. 313‑17). He took issue, more specifically, with the fact that under UAE law, decision‑making responsibilities and day‑to‑day care responsibilities are automatically assigned on the basis of gender (para. 317). Before this Court, the Mother argues that the gender‑based allocation of parental responsibilities under UAE law is a pronounced departure from Ontario’s understanding of the best interests of the child and is the source of serious harm to the children here (A.F., at para. 117). The Father responds that Lauwers J.A. substituted his own findings on foreign law for those of the trial judge, and argues that deference should be shown to the trial judge’s analysis, which was reflected in his interpretation of expert evidence for which no reviewable error has been shown (R.F., at paras. 127‑28).

[85]                        International child abduction, by nature, engages two different jurisdictions, often partaking of different legal traditions for family law. In some instances, the law will be difficult to reconcile (C. Gosselain, “Child Abduction and Transfrontier Access: Bilateral Conventions and Islamic States”, in Permanent Bureau of the Conference, Preliminary Document No. 7 (2002), at p. 6). As such, the jurisdiction from which the child is removed may not share Ontario’s understanding of the law relating to custody and access and of the legal consequences flowing from the breaking up of a family unit. Even amongst parties to the Hague Convention, all of whom presumptively agree on the paramountcy of the best interests principle, the rules of family law may vary in a way that has an impact on how the best interests principle factors into the ultimate decision on custody and access on the merits (Schuz (2013), at pp. 272 and 363‑64).

[86]                        The same phenomenon may be observed in a non‑Hague Convention setting. To be sure, the announced objective of the CLRA is that the ultimate custody decision be made based on the best interests principle (s. 19(a)). This requires that a judge seized of an application for return to a non‑Hague Convention country verify if that is to be the case. But that does not mean that the judge tests whether the principle will be applied in exactly the manner in which it would be in Ontario. As Lady Hale wrote in In re J. (A Child) (Custody Rights: Jurisdiction), [2005] UKHL 40, [2006] 1 A.C. 80, a non‑Hague Convention case in which a parent requested that their child be returned to Saudi Arabia, “[i]n a world which values difference, one culture is not inevitably to be preferred to another. Indeed, we do not have any fixed concept of what will be in the best interests of the individual child. . . . Nowadays we know that there are many routes to a healthy and well adjusted adulthood. We are not so arrogant as to think that we know best” (para. 37). As such, it is appropriate for a court seized of a return application to recognize that it does not have a “monopoly in knowing what is best for children and certainly not in knowing what is best for children who have been growing up in non‑Western cultures” (R. Schuz, “The Relevance of Religious Law and Cultural Considerations in International Child Abduction Disputes” (2010), 12 J.L. & Fam. Stud. 453, at p. 477).

[87]                        As long as the ultimate question of custody is determined on the basis of the best interests of the child, the CLRA does not prevent children from being returned to jurisdictions where the law may differ in some respects from that of Ontario. I agree with Hourigan J.A. that it “is not enough to point to differences in the law and suggest that a parent may have different rights in a foreign jurisdiction vis-à-vis Ontario” (para. 79). He further explained that the serious harm test in s. 23 of the CLRA was designed to protect the safety of children and must not be interpreted so as to permit child abduction to become an approved technique for forum‑shopping (see para. 79, followed expressly on this point in Ajayi, at para. 26; see also Aldush, at para. 28; Jamali, at para. 105). Hourigan J.A. observed the danger associated with the view that, because foreign law is different from that of Ontario, it is necessarily the source of serious harm to the children: “Such a decision would send a message to parents living in the UAE that if they unilaterally come to Ontario with their children, they will not be required by the Ontario courts to send their children home” (para. 83).

[88]                        Nonetheless, there may be instances where foreign laws are so profoundly irreconcilable with Ontario law that remitting the matter to the foreign courts would constitute serious harm within the meaning of the CLRA. Drawing the line between what is acceptable and what is not is a delicate exercise. In this case, there is no denying that the expert evidence pointed to gender-based inequalities in UAE law. But as Hourigan J.A. underscored in his reasons, the proper degree of tolerance for differences between foreign and Ontario law remains defined by the threshold of serious harm (para. 79). Judges who must decide whether to take jurisdiction under s. 23 of the CLRA should be wary of their own interpretation of foreign law, in particular given the risk of treating some countries as de jure exceptions to the CLRA regime. While such a jurisdiction may theoretically exist, Canadian courts must be mindful of undercutting the fundamental premise that return will usually be in a child’s best interests (s. 19 of the CLRA). Indeed, it should be noted that the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal was careful to say that the UAE law did not present an “iron-clad” bar to returning children there (para. 254). The proper approach recognizes that inconsistencies between local and foreign legal regimes will usually not amount to serious harm if the best interests of the child principle remains the paramount consideration in all decisions concerning children. However, if the incompatible rule automatically applies in a manner that supersedes the best interests of the child, this will be a determinative factor in the serious harm analysis, when s. 23 is read in light of s. 19(a) of the CLRA.

[89]                        In this case, the Mother argues that the law of the UAE allocates custody and guardianship on the basis of gender which, she says, is incompatible with Ontario law and means that custody on the merits will not be decided based on the children’s best interests.

[90]                        I agree that equal treatment of parents, irrespective of their gender, is a fundamental precept of family law in Ontario and is tied to the application of the best interests of the child in custody matters. The CLRA embraces this view, as s. 20(1) provides that “[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this Part, a child’s parents are equally entitled to decision-making responsibility with respect to the child”. As such, in a case where children are to be returned to a jurisdiction where their best interests would be superseded by an inflexible rule that invariably assigns custody or decision‑making powers on the basis of gender, the foreign law could be the source of serious harm and the basis for Ontario to take jurisdiction on the merits pursuant to s. 23 of the CLRA. Conversely, the risk of harm will be mitigated if the application of the gender‑based rule is not automatic but instead depends on the best interests of the child. In sum, the question for the purpose of s. 23 is whether the best interests of the child remains paramount.

[91]                        Finally, there remains the question of which standard of review should apply in appeals seeking to disturb trial judges’ findings in relation to foreign law. The Mother in this case claims that the correctness standard should apply, relying in particular on General Motors Acceptance Corp. of Canada v. Town and Country Chrysler Ltd., 2007 ONCA 904, 288 D.L.R. (4th) 74. The Father, by contrast, submits that in this case the palpable and overriding error standard is appropriate. Hapag-Lloyd AG v. Iamgold Corp., 2021 FCA 110, has sometimes been cited as authority for this proposition. He argues further that the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal erred by substituting his view of UAE law to that of the expert opinion accepted by the trial judge.

[92]                        The manner in which this problem came before the trial judge means that this matter of the standard of review applicable to the interpretation of foreign law need not be decided as a point of general principle here. The majority judges on appeal noted the governing authorities in the province, but reasoned that deference was owed to the trial judge’s decision to prefer the evidence of the Father’s legal expert — a jurist experienced in family law before the UAE courts and fluent in Arabic — over that of the Mother’s expert who had no such comparable expertise. In point of fact, Hourigan J.A. observed that, on the crucial question of whether the best interests of the child principle would be applied during proceedings in the UAE, the experts agreed (para. 66). Relying on Larche v. Ontario (1990), 1990 CanLII 8079 (ON CA), 75 D.L.R. (4th) 377 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 378‑79, Hourigan J.A. recalled the limited scope for appellate intervention in respect of a trial judge’s appreciation of expert evidence (para. 61). I agree with Hourigan J.A.’s view that the trial judge was entitled to conclude as he did and that no basis has been shown for disturbing his view. No more need be said about the standard of review of foreign law to decide this appeal.

E.            Section 40 and Return Orders

[93]                        When a court is satisfied that a child has been wrongfully removed to or is wrongfully retained in Ontario, a return order presented by the left‑behind parent is governed by s. 40.

[94]                        Three remedies are available to a judge who declines jurisdiction over custody on the merits under s. 40 (Geliedan, at para. 31). First, judges can make an interim custody order in the best interests of the child, in order to arrange for their care until a final decision is made on the merits or until it can be enforced. Judges can also stay the application on conditions, which allows them to delay the children’s return until they are satisfied that proper arrangements have been made and that the competent authorities are seized of the dispute, if necessary (see, e.g., A. (M.A.), at para. 78). Finally, judges can order the return of the child to the place they deem appropriate (Geliedan, at para. 31).

[95]                        Under the Hague Convention, judges do not have the same discretion: they will be obliged to return the children to their state of habitual residence, with or without undertakings, unless one of the exceptions apply (see Guide, at para. 19; see also Geliedan, at paras. 34 and 69; A. (M.A.), at para. 71). Despite this difference, I agree with Brown J.A. that s. 40 para. 3 return orders share the same purposes as those made under the Hague Convention (para. 127; see also Bala, at p. 308). This Court’s account of the goals of a return order in Balev is helpful here: first, to protect children against the harmful effects of wrongful abduction; second, to deter parents from abducting children in the hope that they will be able to establish links in a new country that might ultimately award them custody; and, third, to ensure the speedy adjudication of the merits in the forum of the children’s habitual residence (paras. 25‑27).

[96]                        Judges’ discretion in determining what order will best remedy an abduction in non‑Hague Convention cases is limited by the interim nature of the s. 40 powers. It follows that judges, after having determined that they should decline jurisdiction with respect to that child, cannot indefinitely delay the return of a child who is being wrongfully retained in Ontario. Had compelling reasons to retain the child in Ontario permanently been established by the evidence, it would have been relevant at the preliminary stage of determining jurisdiction. If the evidence was insufficient to establish that Ontario courts should assume jurisdiction, judges should not use their residual s. 40 powers to postpone indefinitely the child’s return to the jurisdiction best positioned to decide the case on the merits (see C.A. reasons, at para. 137, per Brown J.A.; A. (M.A.), at para. 38).

[97]                        As with any decision affecting children, judges should consider the best interests of the child in exercising their s. 40 powers (C.A. reasons, at paras. 179‑81, per Brown J.A.; M.M. v. United States of America, 2015 SCC 62, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 973, at para. 146). However, due to the interim nature of the powers, courts should not embark on a detailed analysis of the best interests factors set out in s. 24(3) of the CLRA at this stage. Brown J.A. rightly rejected the idea that consideration of the best interests of the child under s. 40 “must be performed in the same way as when determining custody (decision‑making responsibility/parenting time) under CLRA s. 24” (para. 182; see also paras. 183‑84). Section 40 orders are not custody orders on the merits.

[98]                        Nevertheless, judges must ensure the order itself properly protects the child’s interests. Incorporating undertakings from the parties within the return order may effectively facilitate a child’s return by providing an answer to the anticipated risk of harm (Bolla, at paras. 140‑45; J. Chamberland, “Domestic Violence and International Child Abduction: Some Avenues of Reflection” (2005), 10 Judges’ Newsletter on International Child Protection 70, at pp. 71‑72). Further, as in Bolla, even without a risk of “serious harm” within the meaning of s. 23, undertakings pursuant to s. 40 may be in the child’s best interests in that they effectively mitigate less consequential or short-term distress. Undertakings are well‑known and widely accepted as protective measures in international abduction cases around the world (Droit de la famille — 15751, at para. 34). I note that this Court has endorsed the use of undertakings made by the left‑behind parent to assist the return of the children in the Hague Convention setting. I agree with the view, expressed by La Forest J., that such undertakings can assist in crafting a solution that is in the best interests of the children (Thomson, at p. 599; see also Cannock v. Fleguel, 2008 ONCA 758, 303 D.L.R. (4th) 542, at paras. 26‑27). I note too that scholars have observed the prevalence and the usefulness of such undertakings, notwithstanding issues relating to their enforceability in the foreign jurisdiction, as a means of safeguarding children from the harm alluded to in Article 13(1)(b) of the Hague Convention, the rough parallel of s. 23 (J. Chamberland, “Country Report — Canada” (2005), 9 Judges’ Newletter on International Child Protection 75, at p. 79; see also M. Bailey, “Canada’s Conflicted Approach to International Child Abduction”, in B. Atkin, ed., The International Survey of Family Law (2016), 81, at p. 92). As such, courts have ordered the return of children to foreign jurisdictions, subject to undertakings given by the left‑behind parent that they would assist the abducting parent in addressing obstacles, such as obtaining immigration status that would allow them to reside in the foreign jurisdiction (Guide, at para. 68; Bailey, at p. 92; see, e.g., R.F. v. M.G., 2002 CanLII 41087 (QC CA), [2002] R.D.F. 785 (Que. C.A.), at para. 37; Brown v. Pulley, 2015 ONCJ 186, 60 R.F.L. (7th) 436, at para. 199).

VI.         Application to the Facts

A.           No Demonstrated Error in the Trial Judge’s Conclusion on Serious Harm

[99]                        I would reject the Mother’s submission that the trial judge committed a palpable and overriding error when he concluded that the children would not suffer serious harm if they were returned to Dubai. While it is unquestionable that s. 23 calls for a holistic and individualized assessment of serious harm (Ojeikere, at para. 63; C.A. reasons, at para. 140, per Brown J.A.), there are two factors that are of particular importance in this case: separation from the primary caregiver and incompatibilities between UAE and Ontario law. Accordingly, I will address these two factors before turning to whether the trial judge erred in his holistic assessment of whether the children would suffer serious harm.

(1)         Separation From Primary Caregiver

[100]                     I agree with the view of the majority of the Court of Appeal that no reviewable error has been shown in the trial judge’s conclusion that the anticipated impact of separation does not meet the s. 23 threshold. Respectfully, I disagree with the dissenting judge that the trial judge erred by finding that the specific impact of separation on Z. and E., was “unknown” (para. 287).

[101]                     When the trial judge’s reasons are read as a whole, it is clear that he properly drew individualized conclusions as to whether the children in this case would risk suffering “serious harm” within the meaning of s. 23 as a result of their separation from their mother. Considering a trial judgment in its totality is especially important where the judge weighed the evidence and made factual findings throughout their judgment, rather than presenting all of their analysis on an issue in one section. This is what happened in the trial judge’s decision in this case. For example, the judge found that both the Mother and the Father are “loving, caring parents” (para. 15), and that the children’s long‑term nanny has been very involved in their care in Dubai (para. 291(ii)). Both of these are examples of considerations that form part of the broader factual context relevant to the ultimate finding that there was no serious harm in this case, a finding that deserves deference here (Van de Perre, at para. 15).

[102]                     The broader factual context is also the reason why the Mother is wrong to claim that the trial judge concluded that the potential impact of separation on Z. and E. was “unknown” (A.F., at para. 151). Before coming to the section where he stated his conclusions on the serious harm analysis, the trial judge reviewed the expert evidence, and accepted that, generally, when infants are separated from their primary caregiver, they can face emotional and psychological distress (para. 294(iii)). Accordingly, reading the trial judgment as a whole suggests that he did not say that the impact on the children in this specific case was “unknown” (para. 294(iv)) because he mistakenly declined to decide the issue or because he failed to recognize that they would suffer psychologically. Instead, the comment relates to his finding that the expert evidence was unreliable on the specific impact of the separation on Z. and E. (paras. 313‑15). As Hourigan J.A. pointed out, the expert herself conceded on the voir dire that she could not testify about the psychological impact of separation on Z. and E. with “any degree of certainty” (trial reasons, at para. 234; C.A. reasons, at para. 90). The trial judge nevertheless conducted his own individualized assessment of serious harm. He observed that infants “can face serious negative effects from being removed from their primary caregiver” (para. 305) and extended this finding to conclude that Z. and E. could be at risk of emotional and psychological harm if they were returned to Dubai without their mother (para. 366(ii)). To the extent that it could be interpreted as his final conclusion on the matter, his statement that the impact on Z. and E. was unknown is at most an unfortunate formulation. But this did not end his analysis. The trial judge was aware that he did not need to accept particularized evidence about the children in this case to conclude that they would suffer from being separated from their mother.

[103]                     Despite his finding that Z. and E. were facing a risk of emotional and psychological distress, the trial judge concluded that this contemplated risk did not rise to the required level of “serious harm” within the meaning of s. 23 (para. 370). He was entitled to distinguish between adverse emotional effects and the high bar of serious harm required for assuming jurisdiction. Put another way, he was entitled to conclude that, while there was undoubtedly harm, “serious harm”, within the meaning of s. 23, was nonetheless not present. His conclusions are owed deference and cannot be disturbed absent an error in law or a material error in the appreciation of the facts (Van de Perre, at para. 13). I see no reason to interfere with the trial judge’s conclusion that the adverse emotional impact of separation on the children, weighed by its likelihood and severity, did not amount to “serious harm” under s. 23 of the CLRA.

[104]                     The record indicates that this conclusion was open to the trial judge. While Z. and E. are young, the trial judge observed that they do not have special needs or vulnerabilities (para. 14) which would aggravate the seriousness of the harm flowing from their separation from their mother. Importantly, the trial judge concluded that the Father, like the Mother, is a good, loving and caring parent. There is not “a hint of evidence” of the children being mistreated or abused by the left‑behind parent (paras. 15 and 480). According to the expert evidence accepted by the trial judge, the quality of the alternate care that Z. and E. would receive diminishes the seriousness of the harm flowing from the separation (para. 309).

[105]                     The trial judge also considered the Father’s parenting plan. He accepted that if the Mother does not return to Dubai with her children, the live‑in nanny — who has played a significant role in the upbringing of Z. and E. (paras. 261‑62 and 291(ii)) — and other relatives will be in Dubai to assist the Father, himself a capable parent, with childcare (para. 52). It may be recalled that the Mother disputed the role Mary played in respect of the children at trial; the trial judge rejected the Mother’s evidence on this point as not credible (para. 262). Further, the children would return to a safe and familiar living environment, and Z. would also return to a known school. These were each factors that an expert before the trial judge identified as potentially helping to protect against some of the harms caused by separation from a parent (para. 236). Taken together, these factors could fairly be understood to mitigate the severity of the harm that might be caused to Z. and E. as a result of a possible eventual separation from their mother. While, of course, they could never entirely make up for the absence of the primary caregiver, they are relevant to the overall assessment of whether these children would suffer serious harm upon separation. The Mother has shown no reversible error in the trial judge finding that there was no risk of serious harm within the meaning of s. 23 of the CLRA. This is especially so in view of the trial judge’s plain finding, made in respect of s. 40 of the CLRA, that the return of the children would be in their best interests (paras. 381 and 387‑90).

[106]                     I turn next to the trial judge’s assessment of the likelihood of separation. The Mother repeatedly asserted that she would not return to Dubai, even if her children did. The trial judge found that she was not credible on this point and decided to place very little weight on it in his “serious harm” analysis (para. 368). His conclusion as to the Mother’s credibility is also owed deference. It should be recalled that the trial judge was not assessing the Mother’s credibility solely to determine the likelihood of separation and consequent harm. The Mother’s credibility was important for other factual issues. For instance, whether the Father had ever been physically aggressive (paras. 272‑74) and the extent of the assistance Mary provided in the care of the children (paras. 261‑62); on both these points the Mother’s evidence was rejected. However, the trial judge was careful to make no definitive finding — whether based on her credibility or any other evidence — that the Mother would or would not return. The trial judge did express his hope that the Mother would go back (para. 380). But this hope did not blind him to the possibility that she might not do so. For instance, the trial judge explicitly considered what would happen to the children if “she chooses . . . to not return to Dubai” (para. 381). Likewise, the trial judge said that he was “not sure” the Mother would remain behind in Ontario — but immediately thereafter turned to consider what his assessment would be if he did believe her evidence about not returning to Dubai (para. 368).

[107]                     At each stage, the trial judge remained alive to the Mother’s desire not to return, and to the very real possibility that she might remain behind in Ontario even if the children were ordered to return. This possibility was a foundational premise of his assessment of the likelihood of serious harm. The trial judge wrote that he was “not satisfied on balance that Z. and E. would suffer serious harm if they are removed from Ontario and returned to Dubai: s. 23” (para. 389). He was of that view whether or not the Mother returned to Dubai with them, as he was convinced that their return would be in their best interests (para. 387). The trial judge returned to this conclusion in the penultimate paragraph of his reasons, saying that “it is time for these children to go home. No harm will result to them. Their father is there. Their nanny is there. The [school Z. attended] is there, by all accounts a first-class facility. Their lives are there. Their mother will continue to be their primary caregiver, if she sees fit to return. If she does not, then it remains the case that the children should go home” (para. 481). The Mother has shown no reversible error in this assessment. To be clear, the judge’s conclusion was not a value judgment on whether or not the Mother should return: like in Ojeikere, “[t]here may be cases where a parent’s refusal to accompany the children back to the country of habitual residence could give rise to a serious risk of harm to the children. This case is not one of them” (para. 92).

[108]                     Mindful that she would be a divorced non‑national, the trial judge also considered the legal barriers the Mother would face if she sought residency in the UAE. On the basis of evidence given by Ms. Hamade, who was apprised of the Father’s settlement offer, the trial judge accepted that there were several options available to the Mother should she decide to return to Dubai with her children (paras. 194 and 293‑94). Importantly, the trial judge considered whether any “protective measures” proposed by the Father in his “with prejudice” letter could diminish the likelihood of separation, and ultimately, alleviate some of the distress suffered by Z. and E. He underscored that the Father offered, in a settlement agreement that could have been incorporated within a s. 40 para. 3 order, to secure independent residency status for the Mother (paras. 49 and 472). On the basis of expert evidence, the trial judge unreservedly concluded that such an agreement, if accepted by the Mother, would be able to be incorporated into an enforceable, valid order by Dubai courts (para. 294(ii)).

[109]                     Lauwers J.A., without directly challenging these findings, suggested that the trial judge failed to consider the fact that the options available to the Mother to secure her UAE residency were not “assured” (para. 292). For the dissenting judge, this uncertain residency status meant that the children will most likely be separated from the Mother and serious harm will necessarily follow (para. 291). I respectfully disagree. First, it appears to assume that in all cases separating infants from their primary caregiver automatically constitutes serious harm. Second, it suggests that the trial judge did not consider the extent of the harm that the children would suffer if the Mother did not return with them and the separation materialized. The trial judge concluded however that the children would not suffer serious harm if returned to Dubai, with or without the Mother and further noted it would be in the children’s best interests to be returned there, even without her (paras. 387 and 389). Third, it ignores the fact that the trial judge was, as Hourigan J.A. pointed out (para. 63), aware of concerns regarding the precarious residency status of the Mother and of the undertakings the Father had made to dispel those concerns. The trial judge also offered the Mother an opportunity to make further submissions on the possibility to include the Father’s settlement proposal in the return order intended to mitigate the harm caused to the children (para. 472). The Mother did not avail herself of that opportunity (C.A. reasons, at paras. 62‑63). As I note below, the trial judge understood the performance of the undertakings was not guaranteed but fairly accepted that they could be incorporated into an enforceable court order in Dubai (para. 301).

[110]                     But even taking the Mother’s case at its highest, recognizing that she “cannot and will not return to the UAE” and that separation with her children will definitely occur, I cannot give effect to her argument that the trial judge failed to acknowledge the serious harm that a separation would cause to the children (A.F., at paras. 68 and 73 (emphasis deleted)). The trial judge heard the parties and the expert evidence, and he came to the conclusion that the s. 23 threshold was not met. He concluded that it would be in the children’s best interests to return to Dubai, even if the Mother did not follow them (para. 387). The Mother did not demonstrate that this conclusion was unsupported by the evidence or otherwise reflects a palpable and overriding error.

(2)         Foreign Law and the “Best Interests” Standard in the UAE

[111]                     The Mother also argues that the trial judge erred in concluding that parenting decisions in the UAE are made according to the best interests of the children. She says the fact that foreign law refers to the “best interests of the children” (A.F., at para. 108) is insufficient: what matters is whether the substance of that standard conforms to Canadian law. In her view, the trial judge failed to consider significant differences between Canadian and UAE law in this regard (paras. 108‑16).

[112]                     The crux of this argument is that pursuant to the relevant UAE legislation — cited here as Federal Law No. 28 of 2005 on Personal Status — parental responsibilities are presumptively assigned on the basis of gender. Mothers are granted “custody” of the children, while fathers are granted “guardianship”. The two roles involve different responsibilities and decision‑making powers. While the custodian’s role is to ensure “day‑to‑day” care, the guardian is responsible for important financial decisions and other major life decisions, including the children’s education and religion. A mother’s custodial rights can be terminated if she remarries, and when a male child reaches the age of 11, or when a female child reaches the age of 13.

[113]                     The Mother argues that this gender‑based allocation of parental responsibilities is radically incompatible with gender equality in Ontario family law (A.F., at paras. 101 and 117). Lauwers J.A. described it as a pronounced departure from Ontario’s understanding of the best interests of the child (para. 316). While recognizing that a foreign law need not replicate Ontario’s rules, he wrote that the fact that it might fall short of domestic standards must be a relevant consideration for determining best interests of the child (para. 305).

[114]                     I agree with Lauwers J.A. that the division of parental responsibilities on the basis of gender is inconsistent with the gender equality upon which the allocation and exercise of custody and access rights rests in Ontario law. As he noted, a child’s parents are equally entitled to decision‑making responsibility, and determinations of custody are made on the sole basis of the best interests of the children (ss. 20(1) and 24(1) of the CLRA). The inconsistency with Ontario law with which the Mother takes issue cannot be discounted as minor or purely technical: it touches upon a fundamental principle of Ontario family law. This significant discrepancy required the trial judge to determine whether the best interests of the child principle would nevertheless prevail under UAE law should he order the return of Z. and E. for the ultimate custody decision, an objective announced in s. 19(a) of the CLRA.

[115]                     The trial judge did conclude that the best interests of Z. and E. would be the paramount consideration in determining custody in a court in Dubai.

[116]                     In reaching his conclusion that the children would not suffer serious harm if Dubai courts determined issues of custody on the merits, the trial judge was aware that aspects of UAE law are said to conflict with Ontario’s conception of the best interests of children. He relied on the testimony of both experts to examine how those rules are applied by UAE courts in practice (paras. 187‑216). He concluded, on the strength of that evidence, that the provisions mandating the allocation of parental responsibilities on the basis of gender are not automatic or imperative, but are rather subject to the discretion of judges who ultimately decide custody and access on the basis of the best interests of the child (paras. 294‑304).

[117]                     Specifically, he relied on the evidence of Ms. Hamade, the Father’s expert, who testified that the rules according to which a mother’s custodial rights can be terminated if she remarries, or when a male child reaches the age of 11 or a female child the age of 13, do not automatically apply. The best interests of the child principle always takes precedence. As Ms. Hamade put it, “[t]he court will always look at the best interest of the children in deciding whether they should be removed from the mother, even if the mother remarries. . . . [T]he best interest of the children would always be the governing criteria for the [c]ourt to decide whether the children should stay or be removed” (A.R., vol. IV, at pp. 224‑25; trial reasons, at para. 185).

[118]                     Moreover, the trial judge underscored the importance of the cross‑examination of the Mother’s expert to his ultimate conclusion on this point. The trial judge explained how, in cross‑examination, Ms. Schildgen conceded that any decision regarding the children by a UAE court would be based on their best interests and that an abundant jurisprudence from the UAE “make[s] it patently and obviously clear that it is the best interests of the child that will determine all decisions of the [c]ourt”, including in the event that the mother remarries (A.R., vol. VII, at pp. 43‑46; trial reasons, at paras. 215‑16 and 303‑4).

[119]                     The trial judge relied on the testimony of both experts to support two distinct findings with respect to UAE law that were central to his conclusion that its application did not constitute serious harm: first, that the best interests of the children would be the paramount consideration in determinations of custody, access and guardianship; and second, that an agreement between the parties could be incorporated into a valid and enforceable court order (paras. 294 and 298‑99). Indeed, the “Divorce Settlement Agreement through Dubai Courts” — a document that was before the trial judge — included terms that, if agreed to by the Mother, would provide her with custody of the children until they reach the age of 18, even in the event that she remarries (A.R., vol. XI, at pp. 310‑11, cls. 3/1 and 3/2).

[120]                     The crucial point here is that the trial judge did not reach his conclusion on serious harm because he failed to consider the impact of the provisions of the UAE law with which the Mother takes issue. Not only did he consider expert evidence on how the courts in Dubai apply these provisions in practice, but he turned his mind to the practical consequences the impugned provisions would have on Z. and E., considering the circumstances of their family. Hourigan J.A. was right to underscore that the trial judge found “the parties agreed on significant issues like schooling and religious instruction” (C.A. reasons, at para. 81; trial reasons, at para. 378). And if the parties eventually disagreed, Dubai courts would decide according to Z. and E.’s best interests. On this last point, the trial judge also considered that the best interests of the child principle may carry a different meaning under UAE law and acknowledged that Dubai courts might not look at the same factors as those provided for by s. 24 (para. 454). He rejected the Mother’s main argument that Dubai courts would not “really” employ a “best interests” analysis — a claim in respect of which even her own expert disagreed (para. 367).

[121]                     These findings are owed deference. Judges interpret foreign law on the basis of expert evidence, their findings should not be interfered with in the absence of an overriding and palpable error. The Mother is mistaken to invite us to interfere with the trial judge’s reading of the expert evidence and to conclude, based on our own interpretation of UAE law, that a parenting determination in Dubai would not be based on the children’s best interests. The Mother’s position appears to be that the absence of a best interests regime is endemic to UAE law — a position that even the dissenting judge rejected (C.A. reasons, at para. 254).

[122]                     As a result, the Mother has offered no principled basis to revisit the trial judge’s conclusion that, despite the diverging conceptions of family law in the UAE and in Ontario, the children would not be exposed to serious harm if returned to Dubai.

(3)         Conclusions on Serious Harm

[123]                     Assessing the application of the s. 23 regime in this case, I am satisfied that the trial judge properly considered the relevant constellation of factors in this case, weighed them in light of the credibility of the witnesses, and based his conclusion on an individualized child‑centered analysis. As the trial judge recalled, both parents are capable, loving parents; he said, notwithstanding some of the Mother’s allegations, that there is not a hint of evidence that she or the children would be subject to abuse if they return. But the trial judge went further, weighing the other relevant factors. For instance, the dissenting judge said the trial judge failed to assess the harm of an involuntary separation. I respectfully disagree: the trial judge considered the Mother’s residency status in light of the undertakings; he considered the expert evidence on the options available to the Mother; and he decided that the best interests of the children would be the paramount consideration under UAE law. His conclusion was not based on a misplaced view that the Mother was certain or obliged to return; instead, he assessed the actual harm that would flow from the return of the children, whether or not the Mother went with them. His finding that the serious harm threshold was not met is owed deference, and the Mother has not persuaded me that he erred. Another judge might have decided serious harm differently, but that is no basis for disturbing the conclusion of the trial judge given the applicable standard of review.

B.            The Father’s Undertakings Are Included in the Return Order

[124]                     The Mother submits that the trial judge did not properly exercise his s. 40 powers. Before ordering the return of the children, he should have considered their best interests comprehensively, particularly in light of the Mother’s precarious residency status in the UAE and of the impact of the return order on the determination of custody in the UAE (A.F., at paras. 145‑46). She relies on Lauwers J.A.’s comment that the decision to make a return order under s. 40 para. 3 of the CLRA requires a distinct “best interests of the child analysis” (paras. 335 and 339).

[125]                     I respectfully disagree with the Mother.

[126]                     As noted, when judges decline jurisdiction, they are not entitled to rely upon their s. 40 powers to make determinations on the substance of the dispute. The Mother cannot renew her argument to obtain, at this stage, the result she was seeking in asking the court to assume jurisdiction. Section 40 powers should not be used to frustrate the return of the children to their habitual residence when foreign authorities are judged to be the appropriate adjudicators following a wrongful removal to, or wrongful retention in, Ontario.

[127]                     Furthermore, it is apparent that the trial judge did consider the best interests of the children when he made his decision. In his opinion, it was in the best interests of Z. and E. to be returned to Dubai (paras. 381, 387 and 481). As Brown J.A. observed, the trial judge made several specific findings of fact regarding the interests of the children, “about the relationship between the children and both parents and the potential impact of a return order on the children; the adequacy of evidence of the best interests of the children available in Ontario; the potential risk of harm to the children if returned to Dubai; that the settlement proposed by the father, if accepted by the mother, would be incorporated in a Dubai judgment; and that the best interests of the children would be the paramount consideration in determining custody in a court in Dubai” (C.A. reasons, at para. 189; trial reasons, at paras. 294, 347 and 366).

[128]                     Having declined to exercise jurisdiction and having concluded that removal from Ontario would not expose the children to serious harm, the trial judge was entitled, by authority of s. 40 of the CLRA, to order their return to Dubai. The Mother raises no valid grounds for intervention on this point. It also bears recalling, as did the majority in appeal, that the return order is not a custody order and does not result in the loss of any legal rights by the Mother. This appeal decides jurisdiction, not custody. That will be decided by the competent court in the UAE.

[129]                     What remains to be decided is whether this Court should include some of the undertakings proposed by the Father as part of his settlement offer in our disposition of this appeal.

[130]                     In his submissions before our Court, the Father restated his argument that the “with prejudice” undertakings he had made at trial would adequately remedy the precariousness of the Mother’s status in Dubai if she returned with the children and, notwithstanding the expiry of any period of eligibility for residency for the Mother, he renewed those undertakings. He noted that the trial judge relied on the expert Ms. Hamade’s explanation that the Mother had various options available to her upon return, including the promised sponsorship by the Father and the purchase, by him for her, of property in Dubai (trial reasons, at paras. 194‑96). In her written argument before this Court, the Mother acknowledges, apparently for the first time in this litigation, the idea that undertakings could have answered the uncertainties surrounding her return to Dubai. She suggests that had they not been insufficient, the measures could have displaced concern that the children would face harm on separation (A.F., at paras. 9, 148 and 153). The Mother also includes, in her condensed book filed in this Court, the letter counsel to the Father sent her, which was referred to by the trial judge in his reasons (trial reasons, at paras. 49 and 472), in which the Father restates that his undertakings could be part of an eventual s. 40 return order.

[131]                     I consider the Mother’s acknowledgment of the potential usefulness of undertakings and the Father’s renewal of his commitment to take measures to remedy her precarious situation on return as an expression of willingness, on both sides, that undertakings be part of the s. 40 return order.

[132]                     The trial judge, in the exercise of his discretion under s. 40, considered the undertakings to be adequate. I see no reason to disturb this conclusion but, respectfully, they should have been made explicit in the order. I note, however, that the trial judge called for submissions by counsel on the undertakings made by the Father in the settlement proposal (para. 472) and, as noted by Hourigan J.A. on appeal, the Mother did not respond (paras. 62‑63). If the trial judge had had the benefit of the Mother’s views on the undertakings, he would likely have explicitly included them in his order. I note his reliance on Ms. Hamade’s expert testimony, who took them into account, and his lengthy quotation of the undertakings at para. 49 of his reasons.

[133]                     Given the paramountcy of the best interests of the child principle to a s. 40 order, the refusal of the Mother to provide submissions on this point should not have prevented the trial judge from including the undertakings in his order. They provide a source of comfort to the Mother who is concerned about her status if she does decide to return and mitigate the risks to the children associated with separation from her. But to be plain, they were not the basis for the trial judge’s conclusion that there was no “serious harm” here, a conclusion that he came to independently of the undertakings. Acknowledging the role of the undertakings is in the best interests of the children. I would thus make plain that, in my view, the return order recognized the undertakings as a means of attenuating the Mother’s precarious status upon her return to Dubai and, as a result, of limiting the adverse effects of such a return on the children, should she choose that route. This appears to be the most favourable circumstance for the children, who would benefit from both their parents’ continued presence and involvement in their lives.

[134]                     Problems associated with the enforceability of undertakings by foreign courts are well known. But, in this case, the trial judge unreservedly concluded, on the basis of the expert evidence, that the settlement offer proposed by the Father — if agreed to by the Mother — could be incorporated into a valid court order in Dubai, and would be enforceable (para. 294(ii)). In deciding that the undertakings were a viable commitment from the Father, the trial judge plainly had no guarantee that the Father would not later resile from that commitment, as Lauwers J.A. emphasized in his dissenting reasons (paras. 301‑2). The trial judge did understand that the commitments were not guaranteed but I respectfully disagree that he put blind faith in the Father on the basis of his general finding of credibility. The undertakings might have been made a condition for the return but, as commentators note, this is not always the practice (Schuz (2013), at pp. 291‑92). In my view, what is required is that the judge who hears the parties is satisfied that the undertakings given are adequate (see Schuz (2013), at p. 290). This assessment is discretionary and must be made in light of the parties’ particular circumstances. I agree with Hourigan J.A. that nothing in the record indicated that the Father would not respect his undertakings (paras. 71‑72).

[135]                     Moreover, I share the view of Chamberland J.A., writing in a Hague Convention case, that a left‑behind parent has no advantage in acting in bad faith and reneging from their commitments in the foreign jurisdiction: this is a fact that the foreign authorities deciding custody would consider on the merits, and those same authorities [translation] “would certainly hold against him in a context where the best interests of the children will be at the centre of the analysis” (Droit de la famille — 15751, at para. 36). In other words, when the ultimate custody and access determinations are made in a UAE court, the Father will have every interest in showing that he respected undertakings made in the best interests of the children. It was not unreasonable for the trial judge to rely on the undertakings here.

[136]                     In this case, I find it useful, then, to make explicit the undertakings the trial judge himself considered to be of assistance to remedy the Mother’s precarious status. I recall that when undertakings are made under s. 40, the absence of “serious harm” has already been decided upon, as s. 40 para. 1 makes plain. These undertakings diminish one source of the risk of involuntary separation between the Mother, as primary caregiver, and the children upon return to Dubai. As evidenced in the Father’s letter of October 30, 2020, and recited by the trial judge at para. 49 of his reasons, I acknowledge that the Father is bound by the following undertakings:

N. undertakes as follows:

 

1. Prior to F.’s returning to Dubai to live with the children, N. shall vacate the home that the parties’ [sic] and the children lived in prior to F. leaving Dubai. The contents of that property will remain at the property, subject to N. removing his personal items (clothing etc.). N. will tend to payment of all expenses for the property. F. can live with the children at the property until the property below (the “new property”) is purchased and is available for occupation by F.

 

2. Mary will continued [sic] to be employed to assist with the care of the children when they are at N.’s residence. Another nanny will be hired to assist with the care of the children at F.’s home.

 

3. Within 90 days of F. returning to Dubai, N. will purchase of [sic] a home in Dubai, with the value of up to 1,000,000 Emirati Dirham (AED). He will consult with F. with respect to the selection of that property and she can decide what property will be purchased. If she wishes to purchase a property that is worth in excess of AED 1,000,000, she can either finance that amount or make that contribution herself. If that property has been purchased before F. returns to Dubai with the children, she will move to and occupy that property, and N. will continue to occupy the current home.

 

4. Title to the new property will be taken in F.’s name, which will ensure her independent residency status as registered owner of land, but there would be a separate trust document that would confirm that she holds title in trust for the children, with the children having equal beneficial interest in the property. The children would be entitled to realize their beneficial interest upon the youngest of the children attaining the age of 18 years, or such other time as the parties mutually agree. If F. makes a financial contribution to the purchase of the property or has arranged financing of it then that will entitle her to a direct interest in the property in proportion to that contribution.

 

5. The arrangements for the parenting/custody/access of the children will be as set out in the draft agreement attached as Exhibit A to N.’s affidavit sworn September 28, 2020 except that where terms of paragraphs 1-4 hereof conflict with the terms of the draft Agreement, paragraphs 1-4 hereof shall apply.

 

6. Financial provision for the children and F. will also be a [sic] set out in the Exhibit A to N.’s affidavit sworn September 28, 2020, except that where terms of paragraphs 1-4 hereof, conflict with the terms of the draft Agreement, paragraphs 1-4 hereof shall apply.

 

7. In the alternative to paragraphs 5 and 6, if F. wishes to pursue her rights entitlements and remedies in the court in UAE, with respect to custody / access / parenting / support issues / property, she may do so.

 

8. The terms herein will be made into a consent Order/Judgement issued by the [c]ourt in the UAE.

[137]                     I would dismiss the appeal, with costs. I would not disturb the costs orders in the courts below.

The reasons of Karakatsanis, Brown, Martin and Jamal JJ. were delivered by

 

                  Jamal J. —

I.               Introduction

[138]                     I have had the benefit of the reasons of my colleague Justice Kasirer. I agree with my colleague’s discussion of the background facts, decisions below, statement of issues, and applicable legal principles, but I part company with him in applying the law to this case.

[139]                     The main issue in this appeal is whether the trial judge erred in concluding that the Ontario courts lack jurisdiction to determine the merits of a custody dispute involving Z. and E., the parties’ two infant children aged four and one at the time of trial (now aged six and three). The children and the mother are Canadian citizens, and the father is a Pakistani citizen living in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”) on an employment visa. The jurisdictional issue turns on whether the mother established on the balance of probabilities that the children “would . . . suffer serious harm” under s. 23 of the Children’s Law Reform Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.12 (“CLRA”), if they are removed from Ontario and returned to the father in Dubai without her.

[140]                     The CLRA aims to discourage child abduction and provides for the return of abducted children (see ss. 19 and 40). At the same time, by enacting s. 23 of the CLRA, the Ontario legislature recognized that, in some cases, the objective of discouraging abduction must yield to the paramount objective of preventing serious harm to children.

[141]                     In this case, the trial judge found that the mother did not establish serious harm and made a return order under s. 40 of the CLRA (2020 ONSC 7789, 475 C.R.R. (2d) 1). A majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissed the appeal (2021 ONCA 614, 158 O.R. (3d) 481).

[142]                     I agree with my colleague that to determine the issue of serious harm, the trial judge had to assess the likelihood and severity of the anticipated harm considering all relevant factors (Kasirer J.’s reasons, at para. 71; Ojeikere v. Ojeikere, 2018 ONCA 372, 140 O.R. (3d) 561, at para. 62, per Laskin J.A.). In my view, the trial judge made material errors in assessing both likelihood and severity.

[143]                     The trial judge misapprehended the evidence relating to the likelihood that the children would suffer harm if they are separated from their mother and returned to the father. This likelihood turned on the mother’s claim that she will not return to Dubai. The trial judge declared that he was “not sure” that he believed the mother’s claim of non-return and assigned “very little weight” (para. 368) to it because of inconsistencies in her account of tangential and largely irrelevant matters. In relying only on these inconsistencies, the trial judge ignored several crucial relevant considerations supporting the mother’s claim, thereby tainting his conclusion on the likelihood of the anticipated harm.

[144]                     I reject any suggestion that the mother has “self-engineered” her claim of serious harm by steadfastly refusing to return to Dubai. As my colleague acknowledges, a parent can legitimately refuse to return to the place of habitual residence for a “substantial reason” (Kasirer J.’s reasons, at paras. 82-83 and Ojeikere, at para. 91). The mother provided reasonable and legitimate reasons for refusing to return to Dubai. Her precarious residency status in Dubai, her bases for refusing the father’s “with prejudice” settlement offer purporting to provide her with benefits if she returns, and her legitimate concerns about living under the laws of the UAE as a woman cumulatively rebut any suggestion of self-engineered harm.

[145]                     The trial judge also misapprehended the harm to the children. He did not give effect to his own factual findings about the children, including as to the parents’ respective roles in caregiving, in light of the jurisprudence and the expert evidence showing that children generally suffer harm when separated from their primary caregiver.

[146]                     I disagree with my colleague’s suggestion that the trial judge determined that the children would not suffer serious harm by relying on the mitigating effects of alternate caregivers (paras. 104-5 and 107). The proposed alternate caregivers are the children’s former nanny in Dubai and two of the father’s relatives currently living in Pakistan and the United States, one of whom has never met the children. The trial judge did not address these factors in his s. 23 analysis, and in any event, they do not adequately mitigate the obvious harm that the children would suffer if they are separated from their mother.

[147]                     The trial judge’s material errors displace the appellate deference generally afforded to discretionary determinations and demand appellate intervention. In my view, the mother met her burden of establishing serious harm. I would allow the appeal.

II.            Discussion

[148]                     The trial judge described the s. 23 issue of whether the children would suffer serious harm if returned to Dubai as “the most legitimately debatable point at trial” (para. 364). Yet his 482-paragraph trial decision addressed this point in just 8 paragraphs (paras. 363-70): 2 introductory paragraphs, 1 paragraph quoting extensively from the leading judgment in Ojeikere, and 5 paragraphs containing largely conclusory analysis or findings.[2]

[149]                     I agree with my colleague that the trial judge weighed the evidence and made factual findings throughout his reasons (Kasirer J.’s reasons, at para. 101). But apart from paras. 363-70, none of the paragraphs of the trial judge’s voluminous reasons cited by my colleague analyzed s. 23 of the CLRA in relation to the specific circumstances of these children and their parents. Instead, the trial judge’s entire analysis of s. 23 is contained in eight paragraphs under the heading “Section 23”.

[150]                     I also agree with my colleague that a court’s s. 23 determination is discretionary and generally attracts appellate deference (paras. 11 and 75). I accept that appellate courts should not intervene simply because they would have weighed the likelihood or severity of harm differently (para. 75). But appellate deference is not without limit. An appeal court may intervene if there has been “a material error, a serious misapprehension of the evidence, or an error in law” (B.J.T. v. J.D., 2022 SCC 24, at para. 52 and Van de Perre v. Edwards, 2001 SCC 60, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 1014, at para. 11, citing Hickey v. Hickey, 1999 CanLII 691 (SCC), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 518, at para. 12). As this Court stated in Van de Perre, at para. 15, “[i]f there is an indication that the trial judge did not consider relevant factors or evidence, this might indicate that [they] did not properly weigh all of the factors. In such a case, an appellate court may review the evidence proffered at trial to determine if the trial judge ignored or misdirected himself with respect to relevant evidence”.

[151]                     As I will explain, the trial judge seriously misapprehended the evidence in evaluating both the likelihood and severity of the harm. Appellate intervention is therefore warranted.

A.           The Trial Judge Erred in Assessing the Likelihood of Harm

[152]                     The trial judge erred in assessing the likelihood that the children would be harmed if removed from Ontario by ignoring relevant evidence as to the mother’s claim that she would not return to Dubai. Because the mother has legitimate reasons for refusing to return to Dubai, she has not “self-engineered” her claim of serious harm to the children. She is therefore not prohibited from relying on harm arising from her legitimate decision not to return to Dubai.

(1)         The Trial Judge Ignored Evidence Relevant to the Mother’s Claim That She Would Not Return to Dubai

[153]                     In his s. 23 analysis, the trial judge had to consider the likelihood that the two infant children would suffer harm if returned to Dubai (Ojeikere, at para. 62). In this case, that turned on the mother’s claim that she would not return.

[154]                     The only evidence in the record on this point was from the mother. She testified that she would not return:

. . . I will not go back. My -- my -- my children, first of all and before anything else, the -- the reason for the separation was because they deserve a happy mom and deserve a mom, a parent who is happy, and so I don’t see the possibility of that happening if I am -- if I am to go back.

 

. . .

 

. . . I see myself being a better parent if I’m actually in Canada and getting access.

 

(A.R., vol. VI, at pp. 245-46)

[155]                     The trial judge placed “very little weight” on the mother’s claim (para. 368). His reason was, in his words:

I am not sure that I believe [the mother], for the reasons outlined earlier in this Judgment. [para. 368]

[156]                     The “reasons outlined earlier” were the trial judge’s reasons for concluding that the mother was not a credible witness (para. 256). In assessing the mother’s credibility, the trial judge did not identify any issues in her evidence that she would not return to Dubai. Instead, he relied on the mother’s unwillingness to correct or clarify certain other evidence, as well as tangential and largely irrelevant inconsistencies in her evidence about, for example, whether the nanny Mary helped “a lot” with the children; whether the father’s pornography consumption involved girls ages 14 to 16 or rather ages 16 to 19; and whether the mother was resident in Milton, Ontario, since 2005 (paras. 255-87).

[157]                     In assigning little weight to the mother’s claim based on these inconsistencies, the trial judge ignored relevant evidence as to why she would not return to Dubai. Such an omission is a material error because the trial judge’s reasons give rise to the reasoned belief that he must have forgotten, ignored, or misconceived the evidence in a way that affected his conclusion (see Van de Perre, at para. 15; Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 39). The trial judge was required to turn his mind to the relevant factors that go to the believability of the mother’s claim (see R. v. G.F., 2021 SCC 20, at para. 82, per Karakatsanis J.). Although a trial judge’s credibility findings “deserve particular deference” (G.F., at para. 81), a credibility finding can be set aside on appeal when the finding is “arbitrary in that it is based on an irrelevant consideration” (Waxman v. Waxman (2004), 2004 CanLII 39040 (ON CA), 186 O.A.C. 201, at para. 364). Such is the case here.

[158]                     Here, the trial judge addressed none of the following factors that were relevant as to whether the mother’s claim that she would not return to Dubai should be believed:

(a)     First, the mother expressed concerns about living as a woman in the UAE. She noted that in the UAE, the police do not take reports of domestic violence seriously (para. 88). She also noted that she often needed a “no objection letter” from the father to do things for herself, such as to get a driver’s license (para. 93). She further expressed concern about co-parenting with the father in the UAE because she understood that as a woman she would not have equal rights (para. 109).

(b)   Second, the mother stated that she refused to return to Dubai with the children because the father would hold a grudge and the law would allow him to limit her access to her children. She feared that if she returned the father would “destro[y]” her relationship with the children, and she would be “made to feel like [she is] replaceable by -- by a maid or -- or a nanny” (A.R., vol. VI, at pp. 245-46).

(c)   Third, the mother repeatedly rejected the father’s settlement offer, which provided concrete evidence that she was not prepared to return.

(d)   Fourth, without accepting the settlement offer, the mother’s options for obtaining a residency permit are extremely limited (paras. 194-96 and 293). The mother’s precarious residency status supported her claim that she would not return.

(e)   And fifth, the mother had strong connections to Canada, including her Canadian citizenship, prior residence, supportive family ties, and property ownership in Ontario (paras. 3, 14 and 104).

[159]                     The Court does not have to speculate as to whether the trial judge ignored these considerations in rejecting the mother’s evidence. The trial judge specifically explained that he was not sure he believed the mother “for the reasons outlined earlier”. He thus did not take into account any of the considerations referred to above. His failure to address these crucial relevant considerations shows that he seriously misapprehended the evidence and made an arbitrary decision to place “very little weight” on the mother’s claim.

[160]                     The trial judge’s conclusion regarding serious harm turned on his flawed credibility determination. His error goes to the very core of the outcome of the case because it undercuts the basis for his finding about the likelihood that the children would suffer serious harm if returned to Dubai. Had the trial judge addressed the other relevant considerations in evidence before him, he would have given greater weight to the mother’s claim.

[161]                     This error also explains the inconsistent treatment of the mother’s testimony by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal. The trial judge’s ambivalence about his finding on whether the mother would return to Dubai is reflected in his later observation that it was his “fervent hope” that she would return and in his unsolicited advice: “I encourage her to consider whether it might be different [if she returns to Dubai] without the unfulfillment that came with her marriage to [the father]” (para. 380). This ambivalence continued in the decision of the majority of the Court of Appeal. The majority found no reviewable error in the trial judge placing “very little weight on the [mother’s] testimony that she would not return to Dubai” (para. 88, per Hourigan J.A.). But the majority then relied on that same rejected testimony to dismiss two of the mother’s constitutional arguments about the claimed infringements of her rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, observing that “[t]he mother was quite clear in her evidence that she would not return to Dubai” (para. 175, per Brown J.A., rejecting her s. 7 Charter argument) and stating that “the mother has made it clear that she does not intend to return to Dubai” (para. 202, per Brown J.A., rejecting her s. 2(a) Charter argument).

[162]                     The trial judge’s failure to consider relevant factors thus led both the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal to treat the veracity of the mother’s claim of non-return inconsistently and with unacceptable ambivalence.

[163]                     My colleague interprets the trial judge’s express statements that he placed “very little weight” on the mother’s claim of non-return and “I’m not sure that I believe [the mother]” as “mak[ing] no definitive finding — whether based on her credibility or any other evidence — that the [m]other would or would not return” (para. 106). I do not read the trial judge’s reasons that way. On my reading, the trial judge’s reasons on their face rejected the mother’s claim of non-return based on his credibility finding.

[164]                     My colleague concludes otherwise by highlighting passages in which the trial judge said that the children should be returned to Dubai whether or not the mother returns, which my colleague reads as suggesting that the trial judge made no definitive finding that the mother would not return to Dubai (paras. 34, 107 and 109, citing trial reasons, at paras. 381, 387 and 389). I disagree. The comments cited by my colleague are drawn from the trial judge’s discussion of s. 40 of the CLRA, not of s. 23. In discussing s. 23 of the CLRA, the trial judge rejected the mother’s claim that she would not return based on his credibility determination (para. 368). He therefore premised his analysis of serious harm to the children under s. 23 on the basis that she would return to Dubai. His later observations under s. 40 that the children should return to Dubai, “with or without their mother” (para. 387), have no foundation in his analysis of s. 23 of the CLRA.

[165]                     In any event, if, as my colleague suggests, the trial judge did not reject the mother’s evidence that she would not return to Dubai, then this case largely turns on whether the mother has legitimate reasons for refusing to return and whether the trial judge erred in evaluating the severity of the harm to the children, issues to which I now turn.

(2)         The Mother Has Legitimate Reasons for Refusing to Return to Dubai

[166]                     I agree with my colleague that, ordinarily, a parent should not be allowed to create serious harm and then rely on it through their own refusal to return with the child if removed from Ontario (Kasirer J.’s reasons, at para. 82; Ojeikere, at para. 91). This principle against what might be called “self-engineered harm” serves to discourage child abductions (see s. 19(c) of the CLRA). I also agree that a parent’s refusal to return to the foreign country may be justified when the parent has reasonable and legitimate reasons for not returning, including a risk of imprisonment or persecution, a risk to health or physical safety (including spousal or child abuse), or a risk of a significant obstacle to employment (Kasirer J.’s reasons, at para. 83; Ojeikere, at para. 91). It follows that when a parent justifiably refuses to return, the principle against self-engineered harm does not apply. This approach avoids punishing parents who have reasonable and legitimate reasons for their claim that they will not return to the country of the children’s habitual residence.

[167]                     My colleague does not suggest that the mother self-engineered harm to the children by refusing to return to Dubai or that she must accept the father’s “with prejudice” settlement offer, failing which she must be viewed as unreasonably refusing to return (paras. 10, 13, 83, 107, 123 and 133). In my view, the mother established that she has reasonable and legitimate reasons for not returning:

(a)   The mother’s residency status in Dubai remains precarious and depends on the father’s sponsorship in securing a residency permit for her. As my colleague acknowledges, as a divorced non-national, the mother could remain in the UAE without a residency permit for only one year from the date of the divorce (para. 22). That grace period has now expired. The father obtained a divorce in the UAE in 2021, after the hearing before the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and now has both guardianship and custody (decision-making responsibility and primary parenting time) of the children in the UAE based on the UAE court’s determination that the mother had relinquished custody by wrongfully depriving the father of the enjoyment of his rights (2021 ONCA 688, 158 O.R. (3d) 565, at para. 14).

(b)   The mother was entitled to refuse the father’s “with prejudice” settlement offer that, if she returns to Dubai, he will purchase a property in her name, in trust for the children, and try to secure a residency permit for her. The mother had reasonable reasons to refuse this offer: her family and loved ones are in Ontario, including her parents and two sisters; she and Z. have regularly visited Ontario since moving to Dubai (trial reasons, at paras. 14 and 104); and she is a Canadian citizen, not a UAE national (para. 3). The settlement offer proposes that the father would purchase a house in the mother’s name, in trust for the children, to be transferred to the children when the youngest turns 18. It is understandable why the father’s offer — which would see the mother live for years in limbo as essentially a nanny under her ex-husband’s continued financial control — would not entice her back to Dubai. In any event, the father conceded, and the trial judge accepted, that he has provided no financial disclosure to substantiate whether he can buy a property in Dubai for the mother to live in (trial reasons, at para. 51).

(c)   The mother also has a legitimate basis for her concerns about living under the laws of the UAE as a woman. For instance, the trial judge accepted that in Dubai a husband is permitted to physically punish his wife without consequences in some instances (paras. 197 and 293). The trial judge also accepted that under UAE legislation a mother may lose custody of her children if she remarries (paras. 197 and 293). The mother’s evidence was that when she lived in the UAE she had to obtain a letter of permission from the father to accept an offer of employment or to obtain a driver’s license (para. 93). These circumstances contributed to the mother’s reasonable and legitimate reasons for not returning to Dubai. They are not based on generalizations and stereotypes about other countries. Rather, they are based on the findings of the trial judge and the undisputed evidence in the record about how women are treated under the law in the UAE.

[168]                     My colleague proposes to address the mother’s concerns about her precarious residency status by including as a condition of the s. 40 return order the father’s undertaking at trial to secure a residency permit for the mother (para. 133), while also acknowledging that “undertakings made by a left-behind parent before the Ontario courts may present problems of enforceability before foreign courts” (para. 13). I do not view the father’s undertaking to be an acceptable solution to the mother’s precarious residency status because the father has provided no financial disclosure about his ability to buy a second house for her to live in. More importantly, for the purposes of the prior question of s. 23 of the CLRA, the mother’s concern about her present precarious residency status is a legitimate reason for not returning to Dubai, especially now that she is divorced and has no custody or guardianship of the children under UAE law. The question at this stage is whether the mother has presented legitimate reasons for refusing to return to Dubai. In my view, she has.

[169]                     Accordingly, this is not a case in which a parent has self-engineered harm and relied on it in an unreasonable refusal to return. The mother did not rely on vague assertions that there was nothing for her in Dubai, nor did she rely only on generalized risk factors (see Ojeikere, at para. 92; Onuoha v. Onuoha, 2021 ONSC 2228, 54 R.F.L. (8th) 1, at para. 18). The mother is entitled to try to reclaim her personal autonomy and to rebuild her independent life in Canada. She provided reasonable and legitimate reasons for not returning to Dubai, reasons entitled to respect (see Gordon v. Goertz, 1996 CanLII 191 (SCC), [1996] 2 S.C.R. 27, at para. 48).

(3)         Conclusion

[170]                     I conclude that the mother established that the children would likely be harmed if returned to Dubai. I now turn to consider the severity of the harm.

B.            The Trial Judge Erred in Assessing the Severity of Harm

[171]                     The trial judge found that the children would not suffer “serious harm” if removed from Ontario (para. 370). My colleague concludes that the mother “did not demonstrate that this conclusion was unsupported by the evidence or otherwise reflects a palpable and overriding error” (para. 110). I disagree.

[172]                     The trial judge’s own factual findings regarding the expert evidence and the circumstances of these children demonstrated that the children would suffer serious harm if they were to lose their mother as their primary caregiver. The trial judge’s contrary conclusion does not attract deference because it contained material errors and failed to address the particular circumstances of these children on this record.

(1)         Children Can Suffer Serious Harm if Separated From Their Primary Caregiver

[173]                     Courts at all levels in Canada have repeatedly recognized that children can suffer serious emotional and psychological harm if they are removed from their primary caregiver, and thus it is generally in their best interest to maintain this relationship.

[174]                     This Court has often recognized the harms of removing children from their primary caregiver. For example, in Gordon, L’Heureux-Dubé J. stated, at para. 121, “[t]he assessment of the child’s best interests . . . involves a consideration of the particular role and emotional bonding the child enjoys with his or her primary caregiver. The importance of preserving the child’s relationship with his or her psychological parent has long been recognized by this Court on a number of occasions”. She added that “disrupting the relationship of the child with his or her primary caregiver will [generally] be more detrimental to the child than reduced contact with the non-custodial parent” (para. 126).

[175]                     Similarly, in Young v. Young, 1993 CanLII 34 (SCC), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 3, L’Heureux-Dubé J., dissenting in the result, noted that “the child’s relationship with the custodial parent may well be the most important factor affecting [their] long-term outcome” (p. 67, citing N. Weisman, “On Access After Parental Separation” (1992), 36 R.F.L. (3d) 35, at p. 62). As a result, “the major focus of custody decisions should be to preserve and protect the relationship between the child and his or her psychological parent” (p. 66). See also Catholic Children’s Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto v. M. (C.), 1994 CanLII 83 (SCC), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 165, at p. 202 (highlighting a child’s bonding with their psychological parents).

[176]                     Provincial appeal courts have consistently expressed the same view. For example, in A. (M.A.) v. E. (D.E.M.), 2020 ONCA 486, 152 O.R. (3d) 81, at para. 58, Benotto J.A. accepted that Ontario courts had jurisdiction to make a parenting order involving three young children partly because they would lose the primary caregiver they had had since birth if ordered to be returned to their habitual residence in Kuwait. Similarly, in R.J.F. v. C.M.F., 2014 ABCA 165, 575 A.R. 125, at para. 70, Conrad J.A. accepted in the context of relocation within Canada that “possible harm [can] result from a change in primary parenting”. She noted that “[t]he mother has been the child’s primary caregiver for almost all of [the child’s] life, and making a change in custody would upset the parental bond that had developed between mother and child” (para. 70).

[177]                     Courts of first instance have been of the same view. For example, in Aldush v. Alani, 2022 ONSC 1536, 74 R.F.L. (8th) 113, Smith J. accepted that a primary caregiver’s legitimate refusal to return to the UAE contributed to the conclusion that the child would suffer serious harm if returned without her primary caregiver, in that case, the child’s mother (paras. 149-58). He noted that if the child were returned to the UAE without her mother, “[the child] would be deprived of the daily love, care, and support that she receives” from her mother (para. 155).

[178]                     The relationship children have with their primary caregiver is thus crucial to their emotional and psychological welfare. Separating children from their primary caregiver can affect their wellbeing and cause them serious harm. Of course, this does not mean that separating children from their primary caregiver necessarily constitutes serious harm under s. 23 of the CLRA (Kasirer J.’s reasons, at para. 78). The assessment must be fact-specific and focus on the particular circumstances of the child (paras. 72 and 75). Still, the case law’s recognition of the harm caused by separation from a primary caregiver is a useful reminder of the need for careful attention to the facts if such separation is to be countenanced.

(2)         The Trial Judge’s Conclusion on Serious Harm Is Irreconcilable With His Other Findings

[179]                     Despite the jurisprudence repeatedly recognizing that children can suffer serious emotional and psychological harm if removed from their primary caregiver, and despite the trial judge accepting expert evidence and taking judicial notice to the same effect, the trial judge found that the children would not suffer serious harm if separated from their mother. The trial judge reached this conclusion without proper regard to his own factual findings about the children’s particular circumstances. This was a serious misapprehension of the evidence and invites appellate intervention (Van de Perre, at paras. 11 and 15).

[180]                     In his brief s. 23 analysis, the trial judge found that the children would not suffer serious harm based on six conclusions:

I conclude as follows:

(i)           there is no evidence at trial that Z. and E. are in any risk of being physically harmed if they return to Dubai;

(ii)        there is some circumstantial evidence (through Ms. Parker and her opinions about infants, generally) that Z. and E. could be at risk of emotional and psychological harm if they are returned to Dubai without [the mother];

(iii)      there is no evidence at trial about the views and preferences of the children;

(iv)      there is a claim by [the mother] that she will not return to Dubai if the children are ordered to return there;

(v)         there is nothing else in the evidence at trial that this court finds to be relevant to the serious harm assessment for Z. and E. . . . ; and

(vi)      more specifically, . . . there is a total absence of any reliable evidence at trial that the court system in Dubai will do anything other than (a) determine custody in accordance with the best interests of Z. and E., if contested; and (b) award custody to [the mother], if contested, and (c) approve the settlement proposal tendered by [the father], if agreed to by the mother. [Emphasis in original; para. 366.]

[181]                     The trial judge thus accepted that there was “some circumstantial evidence” from Ms. Parker, the mother’s psychotherapist expert, that the children could be at risk of emotional and psychological harm if separated from the mother. He emphasized that, besides the factors listed, “nothing else in the evidence” was relevant to his assessment of serious harm.

[182]                     Based on Ms. Parker’s evidence, the trial judge accepted “[w]ithout hesitation” that separating an infant from their primary caregiver can cause serious harm (para. 305). He acknowledged that “infants can face serious negative effects from being removed from their primary caregiver”, but added that “I knew that before Ms. Parker testified. No trial judge needs expert evidence for that” (para. 305). The trial judge thus acknowledged that judicial notice may be taken of the uncontroversial and indisputable fact that young children can suffer serious emotional and psychological harm when they are separated from their primary caregiver (see R. v. Spence, 2005 SCC 71, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 458, at para. 53; R. v. Find, 2001 SCC 32, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 863, at para. 48). To the same effect, in ruling that Ms. Parker could give expert evidence, the trial judge stated:

. . . the general proposition that removing an infant from his/her primary caregiver may adversely impact the infant, emotionally and psychologically, would seem outside the ordinary experience and knowledge of only a trier of fact who has been living under a rock.

 

(2020 ONSC 7123, at para. 10 (CanLII))

[183]                     The trial judge accepted Ms. Parker’s expert evidence that young children can suffer short-term and long-term harm when they are separated from their primary caregiver: separation can affect an infant’s brain development and can cause cognitive impairment, aggressive behaviours, symptoms of borderline personality disorder, and difficulties managing stress. Finally, the trial judge accepted that the quality of care of a new alternate caregiver will influence how the child responds to separation from the primary caregiver (trial reasons, at paras. 307-11).

[184]                     In my view, given the case law, the expert evidence, and the facts of which the trial judge took judicial notice, the trial judge’s findings establish that the children would suffer serious harm if they are separated from their mother. Both children were infants under the age of five at the time of trial (trial reasons, at para. 3). The trial judge found that the mother has “always been th[eir] primary caregiver” and has been a “powerful force in the lives of these two children” (paras. 291 and 380). By contrast, the trial judge found that the father has “always been less involved” (para. 291). He was away from the children during working hours and travelled “quite often” in his work as a senior bank executive (para. 29). The father acknowledged that “there was a lot of time that he was not present with the children” (para. 59). The father even admitted that he has “never spent an overnight alone” with his daughter (i.e., without the mother) (para. 63). Finally, the trial judge noted that the father “has not come to Canada to visit the children since June 2020” (para. 58).

[185]                     Despite all these findings, the trial judge concluded, without explanation, that the children would not suffer serious harm under s. 23 of the CLRA if they were to be separated from their mother and returned to Dubai to live with their father. This conclusion gives rise to the reasoned belief that the trial judge must have misapprehended the evidence in a way that affected his conclusion (Van de Perre, at para. 15). Absent a misapprehension of evidence, the trial judge’s conclusion is inexplicable. The trial judge’s reasons did not apply the case law or the expert evidence to the children’s particular circumstances. In fact, in his s. 23 analysis, the trial judge did not address the children’s circumstances at all. He simply stated bald conclusions.

[186]                     My colleague suggests that the trial judge relied on the alternate care arrangement proposed by the father and the children’s return to their previous school as mitigating the harm that they would suffer if they are separated from their mother (Kasirer J.’s reasons, at paras. 104-5 and 107, citing in particular trial reasons, at para. 481). The father had proposed that if the mother did not return to Dubai, he would care for the children with help from their former nanny and two of his relatives (trial reasons, at para. 46). One relative, his older sister, lives in Pakistan with her husband and her own children (para. 52). The other relative, an aunt living in the United States, “does not know the children at all” (para. 52).

[187]                     Reading the reasons generously and as a whole, I cannot agree that the trial judge relied on such mitigation in relation to the children. The trial judge mentioned these factors at the close of his reasons in what appears to have been an attempt to persuade the mother to return to Dubai (para. 481). He did not mention these factors in making his findings under s. 23 of the CLRA (paras. 363-70). To the contrary, other than the factors the trial judge did list, he expressly found that “there is nothing else in the evidence at trial that this [c]ourt finds to be relevant to the serious harm assessment for Z. and E.”.

[188]                     In concluding otherwise, my colleague refers to the trial judge’s description of the evidence of the mother’s expert that “it would help the separation of Z. and E. from their mother if certain ‘protective’ factors were present, like returning the children home, and to where their father lives, and to a known school, and to a known nanny” (trial reasons, at para. 236, referred to in Kasirer J.’s reasons, at para. 105). But this formed no part of the trial judge’s findings regarding the expert evidence. The trial judge specifically listed his findings regarding the evidence (paras. 307-12), none of which included what my colleague now relies on. To the contrary, the trial judge stated that, other than the specific points he accepted, he “d[id] not accept any of [the] evidence [of the mother’s expert], whether given in direct examination or in cross-examination at trial, as to what will likely happen with these two children, Z. and E., if they are separated from [the mother]” (para. 312). He then reiterated that “I cannot rely upon [the mother’s expert] opinion evidence when it comes to Z. and E. specifically” (para. 315). I would therefore not rely on mitigation of the harm that the children would suffer if separated from their mother when the trial judge himself did not do so.

[189]                     The majority of the Court of Appeal also did not interpret the trial judge as having relied on mitigation of the harm that the children would suffer if separated from their mother. To the contrary, the Court of Appeal stated that the evidence of the mother’s expert — on which my colleague now relies — “provided no analysis before the trial judge on how various mitigating factors might impact the potential for harm” (para. 91).

[190]                     Even if the trial judge had sought to rely on the alternate care proposed by the father to mitigate the harm that the children would suffer if separated from their mother, it is difficult to understand how being cared for by a former nanny and two relatives who are currently outside the country — one of whom has never met the children — could adequately mitigate the harm in this case. As for the children returning to their previous school, the trial judge also did not refer to this in his s. 23 analysis, perhaps because E. was a one-year old at the time of trial and Z. was four, making any familiarity they may have had with their former nursery school environment as being of trifling significance.

[191]                     More fundamentally, I agree with the submission of the intervener Office of the Children’s Lawyer that the serious harm analysis should focus on the harm caused to the child, and not on factors that may help a child after they have been harmed (I.F., at para. 23). As L’Heureux-Dubé J. wrote in Young, at p. 85, “judges must exercise their discretion in order to prevent harm to the child” (emphasis in original). In my view, the trial judge failed to do so here.

(3)         Conclusion

[192]                     I conclude that the mother established that the children would suffer serious harm if returned to Dubai.

C.            Conclusion

[193]                     The trial judge made material errors in evaluating the likelihood and severity of the harm that the children would suffer if they are returned to Dubai. A proper application of the law to the facts — including the facts found by the trial judge himself — establishes that Z. and E. would suffer serious harm if removed from Ontario.

[194]                     Contrary to the view of the majority of the Court of Appeal, this conclusion does not create a hard-and-fast rule that serious harm will always result when an infant is removed from a primary caregiver, nor will it revive the tender years’ doctrine that children are always better off with their mother (C.A. reasons, at para. 94). The children here would suffer serious harm because of their particular circumstances, including their age, their relationships with their parents, their parents’ respective roles in their caregiving, and the father’s proposed parenting plan. The mother has always been the children’s primary caregiver and the father has always been less involved. This conclusion rests on the facts about this mother and father specifically, not on gendered stereotypes about the roles of mothers and fathers generally. Different facts may lead to a different result.

[195]                     This conclusion also respects the policy objectives underlying the CLRA of discouraging child abduction and promoting the best interests of the child. Section 23 reflects the Ontario legislature’s considered view that, in some cases, concerns about abductions must yield to the paramount objective of preventing serious harm. This is one of those cases.

III.         Disposition

[196]                     I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the trial judge, and return the case to a different judge of the Ontario Superior Court to make a parenting order on an expedited basis, with costs to the mother throughout.

                    Appeal dismissed with costs, Karakatsanis, Brown, Martin and Jamal JJ. dissenting.
                    
                    
2022 SCC 52

JUDGMENT

 

The appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador, Number 202101H0019, 2021 NLCA 59, dated December 23, 2021, was heard on December 2, 2022, and the Court on that day delivered the following judgment orally:

 

Karakatsanis J. — We are of the view that the appeal should be allowed. The trial judge did not err in admitting the hearsay evidence on the voir dire.

 

 

However, we would emphasize that the necessity of receiving hearsay evidence is never so great that the principled approach’s requirement of threshold reliability can be sacrificed. Admitting unreliable hearsay evidence against an accused compromises trial fairness, risks wrongful convictions and undermines the integrity of the trial process (R. v. Khelawon, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, at paras. 47-49).

 

This Court has recognized that necessity and reliability — making up the principled approach to hearsay evidence — “work in tandem”; in particular, “if the reliability of the evidence is sufficiently established, the necessity requirement can be relaxed” (R. v. Baldree, 2013 SCC 35, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 520, at para. 72). Indeed, “[i]n the interest of seeking the truth, the very high reliability of the statement [can] rende[r] its substantive admission necessary” (Khelawon, at para. 86, citing R. v. U. (F.J.), 1995 CanLII 74 (SCC), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 764).

 

However, this Court has never said that reliability becomes more flexible as necessity increases. While the indicia of reliability required to address specific hearsay concerns may vary with the circumstances of each case (Khelawon, at para. 78), threshold reliability must be established in every case. As this Court affirmed in R. v. Bradshaw, 2017 SCC 35, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 865, “the threshold reliability standard always remains high — the statement must be sufficiently reliable to overcome the specific hearsay dangers it presents” (para. 32, citing Khelawon, at para. 49). Indeed, where this Court has considered the out-of-court statements of deceased declarants, we have consistently insisted on “circumstantial guarantee[s] of trustworthiness” (R. v. Smith, 1992 CanLII 79 (SCC), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915, at pp. 937-38), or “a sufficient substitute basis for testing the evidence” (Khelawon, at para. 105). Thus, in all cases, whatever may be the degree of necessity, such evidence must meet the requirement of threshold reliability in order to be admissible.

 

That said, we do not read the trial judge’s reasons as based on a relaxed threshold of reliability. Rather, they show that she applied the reliability threshold described by this Court in Bradshaw, at para. 31. She remarked that the statement was video-recorded, “reasonably contemporaneous with the events and was given to police without hesitation” (voir dire reasons, at paras. 28-29, reproduced in A.R., vol. I, at p. 12). She also considered corroborative evidence, and determined that the explanations alternative to the statement’s truth “would seem unlikely” (para. 44). Based on these considerations, she concluded “that contemporaneous cross-examination, while preferable as in any case, would not likely add much to the process of determining the truth of what [the declarant] said in his statement” (para. 46).

 

 

Thus, we are satisfied that the trial judge’s reasons, read as a whole, show that she properly applied the law relating to the admission of hearsay evidence, and did not relax the minimum threshold of reliability. We agree with the dissent in the Court of Appeal that the references in the final paragraphs of the trial judge’s reasons do not undermine her previous conclusion that threshold reliability was established.

 

 

 

For these reasons, we allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal, and restore the respondent’s convictions.


2022 SCC 53

JUDGEMENT

 

The appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Quebec (Montreal), number 500-10-006907-180,2022 QCCA 138, dated January 31, 2022, was heard on December 6, 2022 and the Court delivered the following judgment orally on the same day:

 

 

Kasirer J. — The Court would dismiss the appeal for the reasons of Moore J. for the majority of the Court of Appeal.

 

We agree with the majority that it was reasonable for the trial judge to conclude that, considered as a whole, the evidence precluded any conclusion other than guilt (see R. v. Villaroman , 2016 SCC 33 , [ 2016] 1 SCR 1000, para 71 , cited by the majority in this case, at para 41 of its reasons).

 

All grounds of appeal are without merit.

 

First, the trial judge did not err in her application of the test set out in R. c. W.(D.) , 1991 CanLII 93 (SCC) , [1991] 1 SCR 742, p. 758 .The judge completely rejected the evidence presented in defence, while concluding that this evidence raised no reasonable doubt. Believing that she was in the presence of strong circumstantial evidence relating to possession, the judge found herself faced with an absence of evidence capable of countering the inference of guilt that reasonably flowed from the prosecution evidence. Nothing in her reasons suggests that the judge used the rejection of the defense evidence as positive proof of guilt. The majority on appeal made the same finding at para. 36 of their reasons when they conclude that “the judge's rejection of the appellant's testimony, because of its contradictions, becomes decisive and fatal for the fate of his defence”.

 

Second, the majority of the Court of Appeal did not err in its application of Villaroman . The “only reasonable inference” test does not, of course, mean that guilt had to be the only possible or conceivable inference.

 

The dissenting judge on appeal insisted that it was “reasonable and not speculative to infer the possibility that Mr. Daniel placed the gun in the bag” (para. 28 (footnote omitted)). This hypothesis is indeed plausible given the fact that Mr. Daniel was seated next to the bag and that his DNA was found on the weapon. However, as the majority of the Court of Appeal pointed out, whether or not it was the appellant who placed the weapon in the bag “is irrelevant” (para. 38). To the extent that the prosecution established that the weapon was not placed there without the appellant's knowledge or against his will, all the elements of possession were met. Thus, the trial judge could conclude that the only reasonable inference was that the weapon had been concealed in the bag in full view of the appellant.

 

 

Third, the trial judge did not err in referring to the appellant's calm reaction to his arrest for possession of a firearm. Indeed, as the majority judges point out, the judge did not use this element to assess the appellant's credibility during his testimony, but rather to assess, as circumstantial evidence, the knowledge by the appellant of the presence of the weapon in his bag (majority reasons, at para. 37).

 

For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.

I.               Introduction

[1]                             At the heart of these appeals is the balance between the protection of the rights of the accused in the criminal process and society’s interest in the effective investigation and prosecution of serious crimes. The appeals raise three issues: (1) the voluntariness of one of the appellants’ confessions under the common law confessions rule; (2) whether the police had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the appellants for murder; and (3) whether the appellants’ confessions were “obtained in a manner” that breached the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms because the police failed to make a “fresh start” from earlier Charter breaches, and if their confessions were so obtained, whether they must be excluded under s. 24(2).

[2]                             The appellants, Brian John Lambert and James Andrew Beaver, shared a townhouse in Calgary with the deceased, Sutton Bowers. One morning, Lambert called 9-1-1 and alleged that he and Beaver had arrived home to find Bowers dead in a puddle of blood. Lambert told the 9-1-1 operator that they did not know how Bowers had died, but he admitted that there had been “altercations all week”, including the night before when Bowers had told both Lambert and Beaver to “get the hell out” (R.R., at pp. 17-18). The operator told Lambert that the townhouse would be treated as a crime scene for now.

[3]                             It is not disputed that the police officers who attended the scene in response to the 9-1-1 call breached the appellants’ Charter rights by detaining them and taking them to the police station without lawful authority. It is also not disputed that when homicide detectives realized that their colleagues had unlawfully detained the appellants, they promptly tried to make a “fresh start” by advising them of their Charter rights and then arresting them for murder. When questioned separately, the appellants initially denied any knowledge of how Bowers had died. Eventually, however, they both confessed to killing Bowers during a fight, mopping up his blood, and dragging his body to the bottom of the stairs to make his death look like an accident. At issue at trial was the admissibility of these confessions.

[4]                             At trial, the appellants argued that their confessions were involuntary and thus inadmissible under the common law confessions rule. The appellants also asserted that the police lacked reasonable and probable grounds to arrest them for murder. In the alternative, the appellants claimed that because the homicide detectives had failed to make a “fresh start” from the Charter breaches that stemmed from the appellants’ unlawful detention, their confessions were obtained in a manner that breached the Charter and must be excluded under s. 24(2).

[5]                             On voir dire, the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta disagreed with the appellants and admitted their confessions into evidence (2019 ABQB 125, 88 Alta. L.R. (6th) 337). Based on this decision, the appellants entered an agreed statement of facts in which they admitted their role in the killing and invited the trial judge to convict them as co-principals to manslaughter. The trial judge did so and sentenced each to four years’ imprisonment (2019 ABQB 235). The Court of Appeal of Alberta dismissed the appellants’ appeals from conviction (2020 ABCA 203, 4 Alta. L.R. (7th) 301) and sentence (2021 ABCA 227). The appellants now appeal their convictions to this Court with leave. Only Beaver appeals the voluntariness of his confession. Both Beaver and Lambert claim that their confessions should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter.

[6]                             I would dismiss the appeals, but for somewhat different reasons than the decisions under appeal. As I will explain, I agree with the lower courts that Beaver’s confession was voluntary and thus admissible under the common law confessions rule. I also agree that the police had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the appellants for murder. However, I find that the homicide detectives made a “fresh start” from the Charter breaches arising from the appellants’ unlawful detention for Lambert but not for Beaver. Thus, only Beaver’s confession was obtained in a manner that breached the Charter. Balancing the lines of inquiry under s. 24(2) of the Charter, I conclude that admitting Beaver’s confession into evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. I would thus confirm the appellants’ convictions for manslaughter.

II.            Background Facts

A.           Three Roommates: Bowers, Lambert, and Beaver

[7]                             The appellants, Lambert and Beaver, and the deceased, Bowers, were roommates in a townhouse in Calgary. Bowers was the landlord of the property, as his father owned the townhouse and allowed him to live there rent-free and earn income by renting out rooms. Beaver and Lambert were tenants.

B.            The Suspicious 9-1-1 Call

[8]                             On October 9, 2016, at 9:59 a.m., Lambert called 9-1-1 to report that “there’s a guy in a puddle of blood . . . inside [his] house” (R.R., at p. 16). He told the 9-1-1 and Calgary Police Service operators that there had been “altercations all week”, including when he came home the previous night and Bowers “had people there” (p. 17). Lambert said that Bowers “told [him and Beaver] to get the hell out”, so he left with Beaver because he “wasn’t about to get into a confrontation” (pp. 17-18). He claimed that when he returned the next morning, he found Bowers lying “in a puddle of blood”, “face down front [on] the floor” (p. 21).

[9]                             The Calgary Police Service operator told Lambert that the situation would be treated with “just a little bit of a suspicion because [they] don’t know what’s goin’ on at this point” (pp. 24-25). Lambert insisted he did not know what happened to Bowers, repeating “[h]e was pretty angry at us, so we just left” (p. 25). Lambert then confirmed that Bowers was not conscious or breathing, and advised that Beaver said that “he looks like he fell and hit his head” (p. 26). The Calgary Police Service operator said that they would “treat [the townhouse] as a crime scene for now” (p. 27). While awaiting emergency medical services, the 9-1-1 operator told Lambert to perform CPR, but Lambert advised that rigor mortis had set in, adding: “He’s dead” (p. 36).

C.            The Police Find Bowers Dead

[10]                        Within minutes, police and emergency medical services arrived and found Bowers at the foot of the staircase, where he lay dead. The senior police officer, Sgt. James Lines, directed that this was a crime scene. He ordered two other officers, Csts. Trent Taylor and Alana Husband, to detain Lambert and Beaver under the Medical Examiners Act, legislation that he admitted on the voir dire does not exist; he had meant to refer to Alberta’s Fatality Inquiries Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. F-9, but this Act provides no detention powers.

D.           The Police Detain Lambert

[11]                        As directed, Cst. Taylor told Lambert that he was being detained under the Medical Examiners Act. He advised Lambert that he had the right to retain and instruct a lawyer without delay and cautioned him, saying that he could be charged with an offence and that he did not have to say anything but anything he did say could be used in evidence. Lambert said that he understood the caution and wanted to speak to a lawyer “to cover [his] ass”, even though he was “not guilty of anything” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 95).

[12]                        While Cst. Taylor drove Lambert to police headquarters, he asked him what had happened. Lambert repeated what he had told the 9-1-1 operator. On the voir dire, Cst. Taylor conceded that he had “messed up” and that he should not have questioned Lambert during the drive because he had asked to speak to a lawyer (p. 109). At no point did Cst. Taylor place Lambert under arrest.

E.            The Police Detain Beaver

[13]                        Cst. Husband placed Beaver in her police car. When Beaver was alone in the car, the car video recorded him saying, “[t]hey’re gonna take my statement” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 26). Cst. Husband then told him: “I just have to read you the legalities here. . . . I am investigatively, detaining you for, uh, whatever’s going on in there, (laughing)” (p. 28). She advised Beaver of his right to retain and instruct a lawyer without delay and asked him if he wanted to contact a lawyer. He responded, “I don’t need one. . . . No” (p. 30). Cst. Husband repeated that Beaver was being “investigatively detained” and cautioned him, saying that he did not have to say anything but anything he did say could be used in evidence (p. 30). Beaver said he understood.

[14]                        When Cst. Husband asked Beaver what had happened, he responded with a narrative consistent with Lambert’s 9-1-1 call. She then drove him to police headquarters, told him he was still under investigative detention, and asked him again if he wanted to speak to a lawyer. Once again, he declined. At no point did Cst. Husband place Beaver under arrest.

F.            The Arrival of a Seasoned Homicide Detective

[15]                        Soon afterwards, a medical investigator from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner contacted the Calgary Homicide Unit to communicate that Bowers’ death appeared suspicious. At 10:36 a.m., S/Sgt. Colin Chisholm telephoned Det. Christian Vermette, a seasoned homicide detective, and told him to come to work. On the voir dire, Det. Vermette testified that he was “basically [being called out to work] on a suspicious death” because it was his “turn to be the primary investigator for the next homicide” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 207). He testified that S/Sgt. Chisholm, who had spoken to the medical investigator, “basically relayed . . . that a male was found facedown in a pool of blood near the front entrance of a residence” and “that there was some sort of conflict or dispute that occurred between the victim and roommates” (p. 205). Det. Vermette’s impression at this point was that the two roommates were under arrest and on their way to police headquarters.

[16]                        At 10:46 a.m., Det. Vermette received an email from S/Sgt. Chisholm with the subject line “Looks like New homicide” and which confirmed what the Staff Sergeant had just told him by phone.

[17]                        At 11:22 a.m., Det. Vermette arrived at police headquarters, and at 11:39 a.m., he met with Csts. Taylor and Husband, who told him that Lambert and Beaver had been “Chartered and cautioned” (p. 210). Det. Vermette then “review[ed] the file”, which included an Event Information document that summarized the 9-1-1 call and an Event Chronology document that detailed the events after the 9-1-1 call and included contemporaneous police comments (p. 209). He also reviewed a Police Information Management System report, which noted that three days earlier the police had attended at the townhouse because Lambert had reported that Bowers assaulted him but that he did not want charges laid and would not provide a statement. The Police Information Management System report stated that Lambert planned to move out within the next two weeks and that he did not want the police to speak to Bowers.

G.           Lambert and Beaver Arrive at Police Headquarters

[18]                       At 11:15 a.m., Lambert and Beaver arrived at police headquarters. Lambert spoke to a lawyer by telephone. Beaver declined the opportunity to do so.

[19]                        Two homicide investigators, Dets. Matthew Demarino and Reagan Hossack, were tasked with interviewing Lambert and Beaver, respectively.

[20]                       At 12:09 p.m., Det. Demarino, who believed that Lambert and Beaver were already under arrest, began interviewing Lambert. He confirmed that Lambert had spoken to a lawyer and that he understood his lawyer’s advice. Det. Demarino advised Lambert that, regardless of anything anyone had previously told him, he did not have to say anything unless he wished to do so, but anything he did say could be used in evidence. He then repeated this caution once more and Lambert indicated that he understood. Det. Demarino also informed Lambert that his interview was being recorded.

[21]                       Det. Demarino asked Lambert if he knew the deceased. At first, Lambert responded that he “[d]on’t wanna talk about nothin’”, saying that the police “have ways to figure out who [the deceased] is without [him] having to talk to [them] about it” (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 7-8). Later, he confirmed that the deceased was his roommate, Bowers.

[22]                       When Det. Demarino left the interview to give this information to the homicide team, he spoke with Cst. Husband. It was only at this time that Det. Demarino learned that neither Lambert nor Beaver had been arrested. At this point, Beaver’s interview had not yet begun.

[23]                       At about 12:20 p.m., Det. Vermette was advised that neither Beaver nor Lambert had been arrested. At 12:22 p.m., Det. Vermette directed Dets. Demarino and Hossack to arrest Lambert and Beaver for murder. When making this direction, Det. Vermette believed that he had reasonable and probable grounds to do so.

H.           Lambert Is Arrested for Murder

[24]                        At 12:29 p.m., Det. Demarino arrested Lambert for murder and then continued to interview him, underscoring that “this is a very, very serious matter” (p. 17). Det. Demarino tried to distance his interaction with Lambert from the earlier unlawful conduct by (1) telling him they were going to “start from the very beginning” (p. 17); (2) telling him four times he was under arrest for murder; (3) facilitating Lambert’s second consultation with a lawyer and confirming that he understood his lawyer’s advice; (4) repeating that they “have to start everything all over again” (p. 30) after Lambert consulted a lawyer; and (5) providing him with a primary caution three times during the interview (i.e., that he did not have to say anything unless he wished to do so but whatever he did say could be used in evidence) and a secondary caution (i.e., that his decision on whether to speak to the police should not be influenced by anything he had already told the police or that the police had told him).

I.               Beaver Is Arrested for Murder

[25]                        At roughly the same time, Det. Hossack arrested Beaver for murder. Unlike Det. Demarino, however, Det. Hossack did not caution Beaver again. Instead, she referred to Cst. Husband’s earlier caution, saying, “it’s no different than what uh, Constable Husband read to you [a] little while ago” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 51). She said that she was “just reading it ’cause [she’s] a new person that [he’s] gonna be talking to” (pp. 51-52). (At the voir dire, Det. Hossack acknowledged that her failure to caution Beaver was “a mistake, an error, on [her] part” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 185).) Det. Hossack advised Beaver of his right to retain and instruct counsel without delay, but Beaver declined to speak to a lawyer, saying he did not think he needed one. He then added that he “probably should” speak with a lawyer and that he was “not understanding the severity of it” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 53). Det. Hossack emphasized to Beaver that it was up to him whether he spoke to a lawyer and reminded him that he was being questioned because “someone was found dead in the apartment” and that he had “been brought [to the police headquarters] because [he was] there” (p. 53). Det. Hossack then repeated, “it’s just important that you know that you can call a lawyer right now” (p. 54), and then said, once again, “it’s important that you know that if you wanna call a lawyer you can” (p. 55). Beaver insisted that he did not need a lawyer and formally waived his right to counsel.

J.              Det. Vermette Confirms His Earlier Decision to Arrest the Appellants

[26]                        At 12:35 p.m., just a few minutes after Det. Vermette had directed that the appellants be arrested for murder, he learned that Bowers had sent Facebook messages to a friend the previous evening highlighting his conflicts with Beaver and Lambert:

6:36 p.m.  im taking brian and jim down they fucked me

 

9:13 p.m.  I just destroyed brian and jim now I can get some worthy roommates any suggestions

 

(R.R., at p. 45)

[27]                        These messages confirmed Det. Vermette’s earlier decision to arrest the appellants.

K.           After Police Questioning, Lambert Confesses

[28]                        Det. Demarino questioned Lambert for over 12 hours. At first, Lambert maintained that he had found Bowers dead in the townhouse and that he had nothing to do with his death. But at the tail end of the interview, Det. Demarino confronted Lambert with inculpatory evidence that led him to confess that Bowers had died during a fight with him and Beaver.

L.            After Seeing a Video of Lambert’s Confession, Beaver Confesses

[29]                        During the first 12 hours of his interview, Beaver also maintained that he had nothing to do with Bowers’ death. He insisted that he did not remember details of events that took place before his arrival at the police headquarters because he had been drinking the night before. He continued to cite his poor memory even when he was shown Lambert’s videotaped confession. Det. Hossack’s interviewing style then became more confrontational. She called Beaver’s memory lapse “bullshit” and said “people . . . don’t forget stuff like this” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 282). Within another hour of questioning, Beaver confessed, admitting that Bowers had died during a fight with him and Lambert.

M.         Beaver and Lambert Are Charged With Manslaughter and Obstruction of Justice

[30]                        Beaver and Lambert were charged with manslaughter for their involvement in Bowers’ death and obstruction of justice for misleading the police in the investigation into Bowers’ death.

III.         Judgments Below

A.           Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta (Yamauchi J.)

(1)         The Voir Dire Ruling, 2019 ABQB 125, 88 Alta. L.R. (6th) 337

[31]                        On a blended voir dire, the trial judge held that the Crown had proved the voluntariness of the appellants’ confessions beyond a reasonable doubt and that neither of their confessions should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter.

[32]                        First, the trial judge held that Beaver’s confession to Det. Hossack was voluntary. Applying R. v. Oickle, 2000 SCC 38, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 3, the trial judge concluded that Beaver had an operating mind and that the police did not extract his confession through threats, promises, police trickery, or oppressive tactics (paras. 82 and 94-95). Nothing Det. Hossack did during the interview broke Beaver’s will; “[w]hat did break his will was the version of events that Mr. Lambert had provided to Det. Demarino” (para. 96). Det. Hossack’s failure to repeat the police caution that Cst. Husband previously provided did not deprive Beaver of a meaningful choice as to whether to speak to the police, since “[t]here is no requirement that the police repeat the caution” if the accused “already indicates that he understands his right to refuse to answer questions” (para. 92).

[33]                        Second, the trial judge held that the police had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest both appellants for murder. Det. Vermette subjectively believed he had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the appellants (at para. 151), and his belief was objectively reasonable “based on the trauma that Mr. Bower[s] suffered, the motive that [the appellants] had, and the opportunity [they had] to carry out their objectives” (para. 159).

[34]                        Third, the trial judge held that the homicide detectives “cured” the Charter breaches arising from the appellants’ unlawful detention by making a “fresh start” and arresting the appellants for murder at the police headquarters (paras. 191 and 209). The Crown conceded and the trial judge found that the police breached ss. 9, 10(a), and 10(b) of the Charter in their initial interactions with the appellants. The appellants were unlawfully detained contrary to s. 9 of the Charter because there was no statutory basis to detain them or any basis to place them under investigative detention at common law (paras. 149 and 229). Their ss. 10(a) and 10(b) Charter rights were also breached because they did not know the jeopardy they faced after being detained under non-existent legislation (paras. 183 and 188). Finally, Lambert’s s. 10(b) Charter right was further infringed when Cst. Taylor asked him what had happened after Lambert said he wanted to speak to a lawyer (para. 185). Nevertheless, the “fresh start” made by the homicide detectives meant that the appellants’ confessions were not “obtained in a manner” that breached the Charter. There was thus no need to consider s. 24(2) (paras. 209 and 215).

[35]                        Fourth, in the alternative, the trial judge held that admitting the appellants’ confessions would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute (para. 254). Although the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct in the initial police interactions favoured excluding the confessions, the minimal impact of the breaches on the appellants’ Charter-protected interests and society’s interest in adjudicating the case on the merits “tip[ped] the balance in favour of admission” under s. 24(2) (para. 259).

(2)         The Trial Decision

[36]                        With the confessions admitted into evidence, the parties submitted an agreed statement of facts inviting the trial judge to convict Lambert and Beaver for manslaughter and to make the following factual findings and inferences: (1) Lambert and Beaver verbally argued with Bowers about the rent for the townhouse; (2) the argument turned into a violent scuffle involving all three men, resulting in Bowers’ death from “blunt force trauma to the neck”; (3) “[t]he force used by Lambert and Beaver caused the death of Bowers”; (4) Lambert and Beaver placed Bowers’ body at the bottom of the stairs and mopped up the blood to mislead the authorities about how he died; and (5) Lambert and Beaver “had an agreement as to what to falsely tell the authorities, and did so starting with Lambert’s 911 call” (R.R., at p. 48).

[37]                        The trial judge accepted the agreed statement of facts, made the invited factual findings and inferences, and convicted the appellants of manslaughter. The Crown then stayed the obstruction of justice charges.

[38]                        The trial judge sentenced the appellants to four years’ imprisonment, less credit for pretrial custody, and imposed various ancillary orders (2019 ABQB 235, paras. 78-81 (CanLII)). He found that the appellants killed Bowers in a “two on one” attack involving “gratuitous violence” (para. 31) and noted that they made a failed attempt to feign an accident by moving Bowers’ body to the bottom of the stairs. The trial judge concluded that the gravity of the offence and moral culpability of both appellants was “very high” (paras. 31 and 48-49).

B.            Court of Appeal of Alberta, 2020 ABCA 203, 4 Alta. L.R. (7th) 301 (O’Ferrall, Wakeling and Feehan JJ.A.)

[39]                        The Court of Appeal dismissed the conviction appeals. There was no reviewable error in the trial judge’s assessment of voluntariness (paras. 30-31). The police also had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the appellants for murder and “made a practical and common-sense decision” to arrest them “based on the information [Det. Vermette] had received by the time of the arrests” (para. 9).

[40]                        The Court of Appeal agreed that the homicide detectives made a “fresh start” in arresting the appellants, such that their confessions were not “obtained in a manner” that breached the Charter (paras. 15 and 18). The police gathered little evidence of significance when the appellants were unlawfully detained, and the homicide detectives tried to insulate any subsequent evidence they might gather from the earlier Charter breaches (para. 17). There was “no causal connection” between any Charter breach and the confessions, “arguably no temporal connection”, and “the context in which the confessions were given was completely different from the initial detention and early general questions” (para. 26). There was thus no need to consider whether the trial judge erred in his alternative s. 24(2) analysis (para. 27).

[41]                        The Court of Appeal later dismissed the sentence appeals (2021 ABCA 227).

IV.         Issues

[42]                        These appeals raise three issues:

A.           Was Beaver’s confession voluntary?

B.            Did the police have reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the appellants for murder?

C.            Should the appellants’ confessions be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter?

V.           Analysis

A.           Was Beaver’s Confession Voluntary?

[43]                        Before this Court, only Beaver challenges the voluntariness of his confession. He argues that his confession was involuntary and therefore inadmissible under the common law confessions rule. Beaver notes that the trial judge was the same trial judge as in R. v. Tessier, 2018 ABQB 387, a decision that the Court of Appeal of Alberta overturned as reflecting “an impoverished understanding of the modern confessions rule” (2020 ABCA 289, 12 Alta. L.R. (7th) 55, at para. 46). Since then, however, a majority of this Court, per Kasirer J., has overturned the Court of Appeal’s decision (2022 SCC 35 (“Tessier (SCC)”)).

[44]                        As I will elaborate, I do not accept that Beaver’s confession was involuntary. It therefore need not be excluded under the common law confessions rule.

(1)         The Common Law Confessions Rule

(a)           General Principles

[45]                        The common law confessions rule provides that a confession to a person in authority is presumptively inadmissible, unless the Crown proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the confession was voluntary (Oickle, at paras. 30 and 68; R. v. Spencer, 2007 SCC 11, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 11; Tessier (SCC), at paras. 39, 68 and 89). Under the confessions rule, an involuntary confession “always warrants exclusion” (Oickle, at para. 30; see also R. v. Singh, 2007 SCC 48, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 405, at para. 38). But a voluntary confession need not always be admitted into evidence. If a voluntary confession was obtained in a manner that breached the Charter, it can still potentially be excluded under s. 24(2) (Oickle, at para. 30; Singh, at para. 38).

[46]                        At the heart of the confessions rule is the delicate balance between individual rights and collective interests in the criminal justice system (Singh, at paras. 1, 21, 27-28, 31 and 34; Tessier (SCC), at paras. 4 and 69; Oickle, at para. 33). The “twin goals” of the rule involve “protecting the rights of the accused without unduly limiting society’s need to investigate and solve crimes” (Oickle, at para. 33). On the one hand, the common law recognizes an individual’s right against self‑incrimination and right to remain silent, such that an individual need not give information to the police or answer their questions absent statutory or other legal compulsion; on the other hand, the police often need to speak to people when discharging their important public responsibility to investigate and solve crime.

[47]                        Voluntariness, broadly defined, is the “touchstone” of the confessions rule (Oickle, at paras. 27, 32 and 69; Spencer, at para. 11; Singh, at para. 31). Voluntariness is a shorthand for a complex of values engaging policy concerns related to not only the reliability of confessions, but also to respect for individual free will, the need for the police to obey the law, and the fairness and repute of the criminal justice system. Involuntary confessions can be unreliable, unfair, and harmful to the reputation of the criminal justice system (Oickle, at paras. 32 and 70; Singh, at paras. 30 and 34; Tessier (SCC), at paras. 70 and 72). A statement may be involuntary “because it is unreliable and raises the possibility of a false confession, or because it was unfairly obtained and ran afoul of the principle against self-incrimination and the right to silence” (Tessier (SCC), at para. 70).

[48]                        The application of the confessions rule is necessarily flexible and contextual. When assessing the voluntariness of a confession, the “trial judge must determine, based on the whole context of the case, whether the statements made by an accused were reliable and whether the conduct of the state served in any way to unfairly deprive the accused of their free choice to speak to a person in authority” (Tessier (SCC), at para. 68). The trial judge must consider all relevant factors, including the presence of threats or promises, the existence of oppressive conditions, whether the accused had an operating mind, any police trickery that would “shock the community”, and the presence or absence of a police caution. These factors are not a checklist that supplants a contextual inquiry (see Oickle, at paras. 47, 66-67 and 71; Spencer, at paras. 11-12; Singh, at para. 35; Tessier (SCC), at paras. 5, 68, 76 and 87).

(b)         Oppression

[49]                        Oppression focusses on the atmosphere of a police interview. This Court has accepted that “[o]ppression clearly has the potential to produce false confessions” because a suspect may “confes[s] purely out of a desire to escape [inhumane] conditions” (Oickle, at paras. 58 and 60). The non-exhaustive factors that can create oppressive conditions include depriving the suspect of food, clothing, water, sleep, or medical attention; denying access to counsel; or excessively aggressive, intimidating police questioning for a long time (Oickle, at paras. 58-60; Tessier (SCC), at para. 99).

(c)           The Role of a Police Caution

[50]                        The role of a police caution in the voluntariness analysis was recently clarified in Tessier (SCC), where Kasirer J. affirmed, at para. 5, that “the presence or absence of a police caution is an ‘important’ factor in answering the question of voluntariness”, based on Charron J.’s guidance in Singh, at para. 33 (see also Singh, at para. 31; Boudreau v. The King, 1949 CanLII 26 (SCC), [1949] S.C.R. 262, at p. 267).

[51]                        In Tessier (SCC), Kasirer J. explained that if the accused was a suspect, the absence of a caution is prima facie evidence of — but does not itself establish — involuntariness (paras. 11 and 89). Neither a caution nor proof of actual knowledge of the right to silence is a necessary condition of voluntariness (Tessier (SCC), at paras. 12 and 74; see also Singh, at paras. 31 and 33; Boudreau, at p. 267). Nevertheless, the absence of a caution “weighs heavily” in the voluntariness analysis because it is “prima facie evidence that the suspect has been unfairly denied their choice to speak to the police and that, as a consequence, the statement cannot be considered voluntary” (Tessier (SCC), at para. 11).

[52]                        When the police have not given a caution, the Crown must “show that the absence of a caution did not undermine the suspect’s free choice to speak to the police as part of the contextual examination of voluntariness” (Tessier (SCC), at para. 8). The absence of a caution may be afforded less weight when the suspect subjectively understood the right to silence or the consequences of speaking to the police. Kasirer J. provided the following guidance in Tessier (SCC), at para. 88:

While not necessary for the Crown to demonstrate, proof that the accused was in fact subjectively aware of their right to silence or aware of the consequences of speaking will be powerful evidence that the absence of a caution did not undermine voluntariness. In such an instance, doubts as to fairness that could result from the absence of a caution plainly do not arise because the suspect has the information necessary to choose whether to speak or remain silent.

[53]                        Some of the non-exhaustive factors that can help show the suspect was subjectively aware of their right to silence or of the consequences of speaking to the police include (1) the suspect’s awareness of being recorded; (2) indications that the suspect is directing the conversation; (3) the suspect’s awareness of what is being investigated and their alleged role in the investigation; (4) the suspect’s exercise of the right to silence by declining to answer police questions; and (5) the suspect’s eagerness to talk, although this factor can weigh for and against such a finding, depending on the circumstances (Tessier (SCC), at para. 88).

[54]                        Absent an error of law in relation to the applicable legal principles, a trial judge’s application of the voluntariness framework is a question of fact or of mixed fact and law attracting appellate deference (Oickle, at para. 22; Spencer, at paras. 16-18; Tessier (SCC), at para. 46). Mere disagreement with the weight given to various items of evidence is not a basis to reverse a trial judge’s finding of voluntariness (Oickle, at para. 22).

(2)         Application

[55]                       Beaver claims that the trial judge and the Court of Appeal erred by taking a narrow approach to voluntariness that merely glossed over whether he had been denied his right to silence or had made a meaningful choice to speak with the police. He claims that the trial judge mechanically reviewed a checklist of voluntariness factors without considering the more fundamental question of whether he could make a meaningful choice to speak to the police when he was not informed of his jeopardy or properly advised that he had a choice about whether to give a statement. He also says that the duration of his interview and Det. Hossack’s “interview strategy” created an oppressive atmosphere. Lastly, he contends that the Court of Appeal improperly deferred to the trial judge’s finding of voluntariness without independent scrutiny.

[56]                       As I will explain, I disagree with Beaver’s submission that his confession was involuntary.

(a)           The Trial Judge Correctly Stated the Law and Concluded That Beaver’s Confession Was Voluntary Based on Three Findings of Fact

[57]                       As the Court of Appeal held (at paras. 28-29), the trial judge correctly cited the general legal principles of voluntariness from Oickle and Singh (paras. 43-46). He properly noted that voluntariness is the touchstone of the confessions rule and must be examined contextually (para. 44). He also correctly stated that although an individual has the right to remain silent, this does not mean that they have a right not to be spoken to by the police (para. 45). Absent any identifiable legal error in the trial judge’s statement of the relevant legal principles, Beaver’s real quarrel is with how the trial judge applied these principles when concluding that his confession was voluntary.

[58]                       In my view, the trial judge made three findings of fact that justified his conclusion that Beaver’s confession was voluntary: (1) Beaver was given a police caution and understood that he did not have to speak to the police and that anything he said could be used in evidence; (2) Beaver knew exactly why the police were interviewing him after he was arrested for murder, which undermines his argument that he did not know the jeopardy he faced when he was arrested; and (3) Beaver confessed because he was confronted with Lambert’s videotaped confession. I will address each finding in turn.

(i)            Beaver Was Given a Police Caution and Understood It

[59]                        First, the trial judge found as fact that Beaver was given a police caution and understood it (paras. 90-91). He was given a police caution at the scene, even if only when he was unlawfully detained. Cst. Husband used standard wording, telling him: “You’re not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but whatever you say may be given in evidence” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 30; see also Singh, at para. 31; R. v. Manninen, 1987 CanLII 67 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1233, at p. 1237). This caution informed Beaver of his right to remain silent “in plain language” (Singh, at para. 31).

[60]                        The trial judge appreciated that the question before him was whether Beaver’s confession was voluntary, even though Det. Hossack did not caution Beaver during her interview at the station but referred back to Cst. Husband’s caution at the scene (paras. 90-91). The trial judge stated that “[t]here is no requirement that the police repeat the caution more than once if the accused person already indicates that he understands his right to refuse to answer questions” (para. 92).

[61]                        Here, the fact that Det. Hossack did not caution Beaver again upon his arrest is not “prima facie evidence that the suspect has been unfairly denied their choice to speak to the police” (Tessier (SCC), at para. 11). Unlike the accused in Tessier, Beaver had been cautioned and understood the caution. Even if it would have been preferable for Det. Hossack to have repeated the caution when Beaver was arrested for murder, a caution is not a condition of voluntariness (Tessier (SCC), at para. 89). Put otherwise, the absence of a caution in itself does not “bind the hands of the Court” by automatically rendering a subsequent confession involuntary (Boudreau, at p. 267, quoted by Charron J. in Singh, at para. 31).

(ii)         Beaver Knew the Police Were Interviewing Him in a Murder Investigation and Subjectively Understood the Consequences of Speaking With the Police

[62]                        Second, and relatedly, the trial judge found as fact that Beaver knew why Det. Hossack was interviewing him after he had been arrested for murder and what he would be questioned about (paras. 83, 93 and 246). Before proceeding with the interview, Det. Hossack told Beaver “right now you’re under arrest for murder” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 51; ABQB voir dire reasons, at para. 93). Thus, even though Beaver did not know his jeopardy when he was unlawfully detained, he did know his jeopardy when he was arrested.

[63]                        Beaver subjectively knew the consequences of speaking with the police upon his arrest (Tessier (SCC), at para. 88). For example, in formally waiving his right to counsel, Beaver confirmed that he understood that Det. Hossack could only take a statement from him if Det. Hossack was sure that Beaver did not want to exercise his right to contact a lawyer and that any statement he gave could be used in evidence against him. Det. Hossack also told Beaver four times that everything he said was being recorded, which Beaver acknowledged. Beaver then initiated the conversation by asking Det. Hossack, “[o]kay, where should I start? How ‘bout yesterday?” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 58).

[64]                        Because the trial judge found as fact that Beaver “knew exactly why Det. Hossack was interviewing him” (para. 93), this is a case in which “doubts as to fairness . . . from the absence of a caution plainly do not arise” (Tessier (SCC), at para. 88).

[65]                        Even so, Beaver argues that Det. Hossack unfairly deprived him of a meaningful choice about whether to speak to the police. He says that Det. Hossack was “deliberately casual” when arresting him for murder, including by telling him the caution was “no different than what uh, Constable Husband read to [him]” and that being arrested “doesn’t mean [he’s] gonna be charged with anything. All that means is right now . . . that [he] can’t leave, ‘kay?” (Beaver factum, at para. 37; A.R., vol. III, at p. 51). It is this “pernicious” language that Beaver impugns (Beaver factum, at para. 37).

[66]                        I do not agree. It was legally and factually accurate for Det. Hossack to tell Beaver that being arrested for murder did not necessarily mean he would be charged with murder (see R. v. Brown, 2015 ONSC 3305, at para. 124 (CanLII)). Beaver also says that Det. Hossack sent a mixed signal about the jeopardy he faced after he had been arrested for murder by saying “in a cautionary way [they] have to charter everyone” (Beaver factum, at para. 37; A.R., vol. III, at p. 54). But the trial judge referred to and weighed all these statements in finding that Beaver “knew exactly why Det. Hossack was interviewing him”. This Court must defer to that finding (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at paras. 15-18). In effect, Beaver is asking this Court to reweigh the evidence to reverse the trial judge’s finding of voluntariness. I would decline to do so.

(iii)        Beaver’s Interview Was Not Oppressive

[67]                        Lastly, the trial judge found as fact that the circumstances of Beaver’s interview were not oppressive (paras. 95-96). I disagree with Beaver’s claim that Det. Hossack created an oppressive atmosphere by asking increasingly confrontational questions during an interview that spanned 13 hours. Although Beaver’s interview was long, it was not the type of “excessively aggressive and intimidating” interview contemplated as oppressive in Oickle (Tessier (SCC), at para. 99). The trial judge described the interview as “conversation[al]” in nature and highlighted that Det. Hossack was “respectful” when interviewing Beaver, before becoming only “somewhat more confrontational” when presenting him with Lambert’s videotaped confession (para. 95). Although the trial judge accepted that, in principle, “subjecting the accused person to aggressive and prolonged questioning” can be an oppressive tactic affecting voluntariness (at para. 94), he found as fact that the atmosphere of the interview did not “break [Mr. Beaver’s] will” (para. 96). Instead, the trial judge found that what broke Beaver’s will was having to face “the version of events that Mr. Lambert had provided to Det. Demarino” in the videotaped confession (para. 96).

(b)         Conclusion: Beaver’s Confession Was Voluntary

[68]                        The trial judge properly applied the relevant legal principles in deciding that Det. Hossack’s interview of Beaver raised no concern as to the voluntariness of his confession. Because Beaver has not established that any palpable and overriding error infected the trial judge’s findings of fact, I must defer to his conclusion that Beaver’s confession was voluntary.

B.            Did the Police Have Reasonable and Probable Grounds to Arrest the Appellants for Murder?

[69]                        The second issue is whether the police had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the appellants for murder. It is uncontested that Det. Vermette instructed the homicide detectives to arrest the appellants after they had been arbitrarily detained for just over two hours. The appellants claim that courts should be vigilant when considering whether the police had reasonable and probable grounds to make an arrest following an unlawful detention in order to “protect against abuses of power inherent when police are actively violating an arrestee’s Charter rights” (Lambert factum, at para. 36).

[70]                        As I will elaborate, even with this vigilance in mind, I do not accept that the appellants’ arrest for murder was unlawful.

(1)         Legal Principles Governing a Warrantless Arrest

[71]                        The police have statutory authority to arrest a person without a warrant under s. 495 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. The applicable part of s. 495 in this appeal, s. 495(1)(a), allows a peace officer to arrest a person without a warrant if, on reasonable grounds, they believe the person has committed or is about to commit an indictable offence.

[72]                        The essential legal principles governing a warrantless arrest are settled:

1.                     A warrantless arrest requires subjective and objective grounds to arrest. The arresting officer must subjectively have reasonable and probable grounds for the arrest, and those grounds must be justifiable from an objective viewpoint (R. v. Storrey, 1990 CanLII 125 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 241, at pp. 250-51; R. v. Latimer, 1997 CanLII 405 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 217, at para. 26; R. v. Tim, 2022 SCC 12, at para. 24).

2.                     In assessing the subjective grounds for arrest, the question is whether the arresting officer honestly believed that the suspect committed the offence (R. v. Shepherd, 2009 SCC 35, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 527, at para. 17). Subjective grounds for arrest are often established through the police officer’s testimony (see, for example, Storrey, at p. 251; Latimer, at para. 27; Tim, at para. 38). This requires the trial judge to evaluate the officer’s credibility, a finding that attracts particular deference on appeal (R. v. G.F., 2021 SCC 20, at para. 81; R. v. Beaudry, 2007 SCC 5, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 190, at para. 4).

3.                     The arresting officer’s subjective grounds for arrest must be justifiable from an objective viewpoint. This objective assessment is based on the totality of the circumstances known to the officer at the time of the arrest, including the dynamics of the situation, as seen from the perspective of a reasonable person with comparable knowledge, training, and experience as the arresting officer (Storrey, at pp. 250-51; Latimer, at para. 26; Tim, at para. 24).

4.                     Evidence based on the arresting officer’s training and experience should not be uncritically accepted, but neither should it be approached with “undue scepticism” (R. v. MacKenzie, 2013 SCC 50, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 250, at paras. 64-65). Although the analysis is conducted from the perspective of a reasonable person “standing in the shoes of the [arresting] officer”, deference is not necessarily owed to their view of the circumstances because of their training or experience (R. v. Chehil, 2013 SCC 49, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 220, at paras. 45 and 47; MacKenzie, at para. 63). The arresting officer’s grounds for arrest must be more than a “hunc[h] or intuition” (Chehil, at para. 47).

5.                     In evaluating the objective grounds to arrest, courts must recognize that, “[o]ften, the officer’s decision to arrest must be made quickly in volatile and rapidly changing situations. Judicial reflection is not a luxury the officer can afford. The officer must make his or her decision based on available information which is often less than exact or complete” (R. v. Golub (1997), 1997 CanLII 6316 (ON CA), 34 O.R. (3d) 743 (C.A.), at p. 750, per Doherty J.A.). Courts must also remember that “[d]etermining whether sufficient grounds exist to justify an exercise of police powers is not a ‘scientific or metaphysical exercise’, but one that calls for the application of ‘[c]ommon sense, flexibility, and practical everyday experience’” (R. v. Canary, 2018 ONCA 304, 361 C.C.C. (3d) 63, at para. 22, per Fairburn J.A. (as she then was), citing MacKenzie, at para. 73).

6.                     “Reasonable and probable grounds” is a higher standard than “reasonable suspicion”. Reasonable suspicion requires a reasonable possibility of crime, while reasonable and probable grounds requires a reasonable probability of crime (Chehil, at para. 27; R. v. Debot, 1989 CanLII 13 (SCC), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1140, at p. 1166). At the same time, police do not require a prima facie case for conviction before making an arrest (Storrey, at p. 251; Shepherd, at para. 23; Tim, at para. 24). Nor do the police need to establish that the offence was committed on a balance of probabilities (Mugesera v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 SCC 40, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 100, at para. 114; see also R. v. Henareh, 2017 BCCA 7, at para. 39 (CanLII); R. v. Loewen, 2010 ABCA 255, 490 A.R. 72, at para. 18). Instead, the reasonable and probable grounds standard requires “a reasonable belief that an individual is connected to the offence” (MacKenzie, at para. 74 (emphasis deleted); Debot, at p. 1166). A reasonable belief exists when “there is an objective basis for the belief which is based on compelling and credible information” (Mugesera, at para. 114; see also R. v. Al Askari, 2021 ABCA 204, 28 Alta. L.R. (7th) 129, at para. 25; R. v. Omeasoo, 2019 MBCA 43, [2019] 6 W.W.R. 280, at para. 30; R. v. Summers, 2019 NLCA 11, 4 C.A.N.L.R. 156, at para. 21). The police are also not required to undertake further investigation to seek exculpatory facts or to rule out possible innocent explanations for the events before making an arrest (Chehil, at para. 34; Shepherd, at para. 23; R. v. Ha, 2018 ABCA 233, 71 Alta. L.R. (6th) 46, at para. 34; R. v. MacCannell, 2014 BCCA 254, 359 B.C.A.C. 1, at paras. 44-45; R. v. Rezansoff, 2014 SKCA 80, 442 Sask. R. 1, at para. 28; E. G. Ewaschuk, Criminal Pleadings & Practice in Canada (3rd ed. (loose-leaf)), at § 5:40).

7.                     The police cannot rely on evidence discovered after the arrest to justify the subjective or objective grounds for arrest (R. v. Biron, 1975 CanLII 13 (SCC), [1976] 2 S.C.R. 56, at p. 72; R. v. Brayton, 2021 ABCA 316, 33 Alta. L.R. (7th) 241, at para. 43; Ha, at paras. 20-23; R. v. Montgomery, 2009 BCCA 41, 265 B.C.A.C. 284, at para. 27; Ewaschuk, at § 5:40).

8.                     When a police officer orders another officer to make an arrest, the police officer who directed the arrest must have had reasonable and probable grounds. It is immaterial whether the officer who makes the arrest personally had reasonable and probable grounds (Debot, at pp. 1166-67).

[73]                        The existence of reasonable and probable grounds for a warrantless arrest is based on the trial judge’s factual findings reviewable only for palpable and overriding error. Whether the facts as found by the trial judge amount to reasonable and probable grounds is a question of law reviewable for correctness (Shepherd, at para. 20; Tim, at para. 25).

(2)         Contemporaneous Police Notes Are Desirable but Not Mandatory in a Warrantless Arrest

[74]                        The appellants do not question the legal principles above. Instead, they contend that a warrantless arrest is unlawful where the police fail to take detailed contemporaneous notes of their grounds for arrest and the material relied on in forming those grounds. They claim that the lack of contemporaneous notes frustrates a court’s ability to review the existence of subjective grounds for arrest, the information known to the officer at the time of arrest, and whether this information justifies the subjective grounds from an objective viewpoint.

[75]                        I agree that contemporaneous notes are generally desirable when determining whether the police had reasonable and probable grounds for a warrantless arrest, but I disagree that such notes should be mandatory in all cases. This Court has insisted on detailed notes to justify the police conducting warrantless cell phone searches (R. v. Fearon, 2014 SCC 77, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 621, at para. 82), and has encouraged them in several contexts, including for strip searches (R. v. Golden, 2001 SCC 83, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 679, at para. 101), for warranted searches of a computer (R. v. Vu, 2013 SCC 60, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 657, at para. 70), and after searching a home incident to arrest (R. v. Stairs, 2022 SCC 11, at para. 81). However, our law has never insisted on contemporaneous notes for all warrantless arrests, nor would I impose such a requirement. Insisting on contemporaneous notes in all cases could undermine the ability of the police to respond appropriately to the dynamic situations they face each day.

[76]                        The lack of contemporaneous notes does not necessarily frustrate judicial review of warrantless arrests. Courts routinely evaluate the existence of reasonable and probable grounds based on the arresting officer’s testimony and other evidence (see, e.g., R. v. Nguyen, 2017 BCPC 131; R. v. Kroeker, 2019 BCPC 127; R. v. Rauch, 2022 BCPC 117; R. v. Daley, 2015 ONSC 7367).

[77]                        I therefore conclude that contemporaneous notes are not legally required for a warrantless arrest in all cases. Nor, as I will explain, does the absence of such notes frustrate judicial review here.

(3)         Application

(a)           Det. Vermette Had Reasonable and Probable Grounds to Arrest the Appellants

[78]                        Here, the trial judge accepted Det. Vermette’s testimony that he had subjective reasonable and probable grounds to direct the appellants’ arrests for murder (paras. 151, 153, 157, 232 and 240). That finding is uncontested. The contested issue is whether those grounds were objectively reasonable. The appellants say that Det. Vermette had no more than an “impression” that Bowers’ death was suspicious, which fails to meet the threshold of credibly based probability that the appellants murdered Bowers.

[79]                        I do not agree. I readily accept that some of the evidence Det. Vermette had when he formed his reasonable and probable grounds may have pointed towards Bowers’ death being an accident rather than murder. This includes, for example, Lambert’s statement to the 9-1-1 operator that “[Beaver] says he looks like he fell and hit his head” (R.R., at p. 26). But Det. Vermette did not have to rule out possible innocent explanations of Bowers’ death before arresting the appellants. Nor did he require a prima facie case for conviction.

[80]                        I also readily accept that the police relied on circumstantial evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the appellants, but this is not unusual. When the police learn of a suspicious death and there is no direct evidence of who may be responsible, they routinely look to motive and opportunity to further their investigation. For example, in Latimer, at para. 27, this Court held that the police had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest a father for the murder of his severely disabled daughter based on the circumstantial evidence that carbon monoxide was found in the daughter’s blood, strongly suggesting that she had been poisoned; that it was unlikely that her death was accidental; that given her physical condition, her death could not have been suicide; and that the father had both motive and opportunity. This is not to say that motive, opportunity, and a suspicious death will establish reasonable and probable grounds to arrest for murder in every case. Whether circumstantial evidence of this nature establishes grounds to arrest will depend on the facts and the strength of the evidence.

[81]                        Here, the trial judge’s factual findings confirm that Det. Vermette’s belief that the appellants were connected to Bowers’ death was objectively reasonable when he directed their arrest. Far from having a mere suspicion, Det. Vermette had compelling and credible information that the appellants had motive to kill Bowers, that they had the opportunity to act on this motive, and that Bowers’ death was suspicious.

(i)            The Appellants Had Motive and Opportunity to Kill Bowers

[82]                        The trial judge found that both appellants had the motive and opportunity to kill Bowers (para. 159). These factual findings were amply supported by the information before Det. Vermette when he formed his subjective reasonable and probable grounds. The appellants had motive to kill Bowers based on the recent history of conflict and violence in the townhouse that had led to “altercations all week”, including the night before when Bowers had angrily told the appellants to “get the hell out”, and a few days earlier when the police had attended the townhouse after Lambert claimed that Bowers had assaulted him. The appellants also had the opportunity to kill Bowers because they lived with him, they were the last known persons to see him alive, and they claimed to have discovered his body at the townhouse before placing the 9‑1‑1 call (para. 143).

(ii)         Bowers’ Death Was Suspicious

[83]                        The totality of the circumstances also showed that Bowers’ death was suspicious.

[84]                        First, Det. Vermette, a seasoned homicide detective, viewed the death as suspicious. His view was supported by the call he had received from S/Sgt. Chisholm calling him into work. S/Sgt. Chisholm had advised him that he had spoken with the medical investigator’s office, which had “vast experience” and which had advised that the homicide team needed to be called out to investigate because the “death investigator” had identified “issues” or “problems” (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 238-39). As Det. Vermette put it, the medical investigator’s office effectively said, “[h]ey, this is suspicious” (p. 239). Det. Vermette viewed this as “important” because he knew from experience how the medical investigator’s office triaged calls in cases of suspicious deaths (p. 227). S/Sgt. Chisholm’s follow-up email to him also had the subject line “Looks like New homicide”. None of this information had been available to the police when the appellants were unlawfully detained, but all of it was available to them when they arrested the appellants for murder.

[85]                        Second, the evidence of the appellants’ motive and opportunity reinforced the suspicious nature of the death. Bowers was found dead in the townhouse he lived in with the appellants, the morning after he had argued with them and had angrily told them to “get the hell out”. This atmosphere of violence was not an isolated incident: Lambert told the 9-1-1 operator that there had been “altercations all week” and alleged that Bowers assaulted him just three days earlier.

[86]                        Finally, police found Bowers lying face down in a pool of blood with apparent trauma to his body, and the townhouse was being treated as a crime scene (ABQB voir dire reasons, at para. 158).

(b)         Det. Vermette Did Not Form His Grounds to Arrest in Two Minutes

[87]                        I also do not accept the appellants’ argument that Det. Vermette’s decision to arrest the appellants for murder was a “hurried decision” made “two minutes after being advised the appellants were unlawfully detained” (Lambert factum, at para. 48; Beaver factum, at para. 44). Det. Vermette was confronted with this theory on cross‑examination and rejected it as “not accurate” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 256). His unchallenged evidence was that when he directed the appellants’ arrests, he was “already satisfied” of the grounds for arrest because he had reviewed all the relevant material over the course of the morning (p. 256).

(c)           Conclusion: The Appellants Were Lawfully Arrested

[88]                        Examining all the information before Det. Vermette — including the appellants’ motive to kill Bowers, the opportunity they had to act on this motive, and the evidence that Bowers’ death was suspicious — through the eyes of a reasonable person with the knowledge, training, and experience comparable to such a seasoned homicide detective, I conclude that Det. Vermette had objectively reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the appellants for murder. Det. Vermette’s grounds went well beyond a hunch or intuition and objectively justified his reasonable belief that the appellants were involved in Bowers’ killing.

C.            Should the Appellants’ Confessions Be Excluded Under Section 24(2) of the Charter?

[89]                        The final issue is whether the appellants’ confessions should be excluded from evidence under s. 24(2) of the Charter. The appellants say that because the police failed to effect a “fresh start” from the earlier Charter violations arising from their unlawful detention, their confessions were “obtained in a manner” that breached the Charter and must be excluded under s. 24(2).

(1)         The Charter Rights Infringed

[90]                        The s. 24(2) analysis requires identifying the Charter rights infringed. The Crown conceded, and the trial judge found, that the police breached the appellants’ ss. 9, 10(a), and 10(b) Charter rights from when they were unlawfully detained until they were arrested for murder about two hours later. The police breached s. 9 by unlawfully detaining the appellants at the scene and by transporting them to the police station while they were being “investigatively detained” under the non-existent Medical Examiners Act. There was no basis to place the appellants under investigative detention at common law because, at the time of their detention, there was no “clear nexus” between them and Bowers’ death, and it had not been established that Bowers’ death resulted from a recent criminal offence (ABQB voir dire reasons, at para. 149). Nor, at the time, was there statutory authority to arrest the appellants under the more onerous reasonable and probable grounds standard in s. 495(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The police also breached s. 10(a) of the Charter by failing to give the appellants a legally valid reason for their detention and breached s. 10(b) because the appellants did not know the jeopardy they faced while they were unlawfully detained (paras. 183 and 188). Finally, the police breached Lambert’s s. 10(b) rights by asking him questions in the police car after he had said that he wanted to speak to a lawyer (para. 185).

[91]                        I do not accept the appellants’ suggestion that the trial judge found that the police breached their s. 8 Charter rights. The trial judge considered only Lambert’s s. 8 Charter rights and found that both his arrest for murder and the search of his person incident to arrest were lawful (para. 210).

[92]                        I also reject the appellants’ suggestion that the trial judge found that the police breached their rights to silence under s. 7 of the Charter. The trial judge noted that because the appellants’ confessions were voluntary, the argument that their confessions were obtained in a manner that breached their s. 7 right to silence could not succeed: it is established that a voluntary confession cannot have been obtained in a manner that breached s. 7 of the Charter (paras. 127-30, citing Singh, at para. 8, and R. v. Broyles, 1991 CanLII 15 (SCC), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 595, at p. 609; see also D. M. Paciocco, P. Paciocco and L. Stuesser, The Law of Evidence (8th ed. 2020), at p. 453). I see no error in these conclusions.

[93]                        As a result, I will consider whether the confessions should be excluded under s. 24(2) based solely on the ss. 9, 10(a), and 10(b) Charter violations. As I detail below, I have concluded that Lambert’s confession was not “obtained in a manner” that breached the Charter, but that Beaver’s confession was. The police severed any contextual connection between Lambert’s confession and the earlier Charter breaches arising from his unlawful detention and rendered any temporal connection to those breaches remote or tenuous. In doing so, the police made a “fresh start” from the Charter breaches for Lambert. However, the police failed to do so for Beaver. This Court must therefore consider whether exclusion of Beaver’s confession is required under s. 24(2). On a proper weighing of the relevant considerations, I conclude that it is not.

(2)         The “Obtained in a Manner” Threshold Requirement

[94]                        There are two components to determining whether evidence must be excluded under s. 24(2). The first component — the threshold requirement — asks whether the evidence was “obtained in a manner” that infringed or denied a Charter right or freedom. If the threshold requirement is met, the second component — the evaluative component — asks whether, having regard to all the circumstances, admitting the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute (see R. v. Plaha (2004), 2004 CanLII 21043 (ON CA), 189 O.A.C. 376, at para. 44, per Doherty J.A., who coined this terminology; see also R. v. Strachan, 1988 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 980, at p. 1000; Tim, at para. 74; R. v. McSweeney, 2020 ONCA 2, 451 C.R.R. (2d) 357, at para. 57; R. v. Lauriente, 2010 BCCA 72, 283 B.C.A.C. 215, at para. 35; S. C. Hill, D. M. Tanovich and L. P. Strezos, McWilliams’ Canadian Criminal Evidence (5th ed. (loose-leaf)), at § 19:22).

(a)           “Fresh Start” and the Threshold Requirement

[95]                        Section 24(2) of the Charter is engaged only when the accused first establishes that evidence was “obtained in a manner” that breached the Charter. The threshold requirement “insists that there be a nexus” between the Charter breach and the evidence, absent which “s. 24(2) has no application” (R. v. Manchulenko, 2013 ONCA 543, 116 O.R. (3d) 721, at para. 71, per Watt J.A.). Determining whether evidence was “obtained in a manner” that infringed the Charter involves a case-specific factual inquiry into the existence and sufficiency of the connection between the Charter breach and the evidence obtained. There is “no hard and fast rule” (Strachan, at p. 1006; Tim, at para. 78).

[96]                        The general principles governing the application of the threshold requirement were helpfully summarized by Moldaver J. in R. v. Mack, 2014 SCC 58, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 38:

Whether evidence was “obtained in a manner” that infringed an accused’s rights under the Charter depends on the nature of the connection between the Charter violation and the evidence that was ultimately obtained. The courts have adopted a purposive approach to this inquiry. Establishing a strict causal relationship between the breach and the subsequent discovery of evidence is unnecessary. Evidence will be tainted if the breach and the discovery of the impugned evidence are part of the same transaction or course of conduct. The required connection between the breach and the subsequent statement may be temporal, contextual, causal, or a combination of the three. A “remote” or “tenuous” connection between the breach and the impugned evidence will not suffice (Wittwer, at para. 21).

See also R. v. Pino, 2016 ONCA 389, 130 O.R. (3d) 561, at para. 72, per Laskin J.A.; Tim, at para. 78.

[97]                        A large body of appellate jurisprudence and academic commentary has recognized that evidence will not be “obtained in a manner” that breached the Charter when the police made a “fresh start” from an earlier Charter breach by severing any temporal, contextual, or causal connection between the Charter breach and the evidence obtained or by rendering any such connection remote or tenuous. In some cases, the police may make a “fresh start” by later complying with the Charter, although subsequent compliance does not result in a “fresh start” in every case. The inquiry must be sensitive to the facts of each case (see R. v. Wittwer, 2008 SCC 33, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 235, at paras. 3 and 21-22; Plaha, at paras. 47 and 53; R. v. Lewis, 2007 ONCA 349, 86 O.R. (3d) 46, at para. 31; R. v. Simon, 2008 ONCA 578, 269 O.A.C. 259, at para. 69; R. v. Woods, 2008 ONCA 713, at paras. 10-11 (CanLII); Manchulenko, at paras. 68-70; R. v. Hamilton, 2017 ONCA 179, 347 C.C.C. (3d) 19, at para. 54; McSweeney, at para. 59; Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at p. 485; P. J. Sankoff, The Law of Witnesses and Evidence in Canada (loose-leaf), at § 20:10; S. Penney, V. Rondinelli and J. Stribopoulos, Criminal Procedure in Canada (3rd ed. 2022), at ¶¶10.122-10.124; R. J. Marin, Admissibility of Statements (9th ed. (loose-leaf)), at §§ 2:36 and 5:68; D. Watt, Watt’s Manual of Criminal Evidence (2021), at §41.01; Ewaschuk, at § 31:1565).

[98]                        The concept of a “fresh start” under s. 24(2) of the Charter was adopted from the common law “derived confessions rule”, under which a court examines whether an otherwise voluntary confession is sufficiently connected to a prior involuntary confession to be tainted (Penney, Rondinelli and Stribopoulos, at ¶¶4.50-4.52 and 10.122-10.123; Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at p. 426, fn. 179, and p. 485, fn. 72). Under this rule, courts evaluate whether a voluntary confession is admissible, despite the prior involuntary confession, by making a “factual determination based on factors designed to ascertain the degree of connection between the two statements”, such as “the time span between the statements, advertence to the previous statement during questioning, the discovery of additional incriminating evidence subsequent to the first statement, the presence of the same police officers at both interrogations and other similarities between the two circumstances” (R. v. I. (L.R.) and T. (E.), 1993 CanLII 51 (SCC), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 504, at p. 526; see also R. v. R. (D.), 1994 CanLII 131 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 881, at p. 882; R. v. S.G.T., 2010 SCC 20, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 688, at paras. 28-30; Manchulenko, at paras. 67 and 69).

[99]                        In some cases, evidence will remain tainted by a Charter breach despite subsequent Charter compliance. For this reason, “[c]are should be taken in using the ‘fresh start’ label to resolve ‘obtained in a manner’ inquiries” (Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at p. 485). Whether evidence was “obtained in a manner” is not determined by whether the state eventually complied with its Charter obligations, but instead is based on whether there remains a sufficient causal, temporal, or contextual connection between the Charter breach and the impugned evidence. In this way, the “fresh start” analysis fits comfortably within this Court’s holistic approach to whether evidence was “obtained in a manner” that breached the Charter.

(b)         Cases Illustrating the “Fresh Start” Concept

[100]                     In Wittwer, Fish J. for this Court accepted that, in principle, the police can make a “fresh start” after a Charter violation, even though he found no “fresh start” on the facts. The accused had made two incriminating statements to the police that were inadmissible because they were made contrary to the accused’s right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter. Five months later, while the accused was in custody on another charge, a different officer informed him of his right to counsel and questioned him again, claiming that he did not know the content of the earlier statements. The accused provided no incriminating information until he was confronted with one of his earlier incriminating statements, at which point he made a third incriminating statement. Fish J. ruled that by referring to the earlier incriminating statement, the police “intentionally and explicitly bridged” the gap between the inadmissible statement and the third statement, thus preserving the temporal, causal, and contextual connections between them (para. 22). He explained that “[w]hat began as a permissible fresh start thus ended as an impermissible interrogation inseparably linked to its tainted past” (para. 3 (emphasis in original)). The third statement was thus “obtained in a manner” that breached the Charter and was then excluded under s. 24(2).

[101]                     By contrast, in Simon the Ontario Court of Appeal found that the police did make a “fresh start”. In that case, the police had placed the accused under surveillance while investigating sexual assaults and arrested him for being in possession of a stolen van. They advised him of his right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter in connection with the stolen van, but they did not advise him of his s. 10(b) right in connection with the sexual assaults before they questioned him about them. During questioning, the accused gave his written consent to provide the police with a saliva sample for DNA analysis for the sexual assault investigation. When giving this consent, the accused acknowledged that he did not have to provide the sample, that it could be used against him in criminal proceedings, and that he had the right to discuss with a lawyer whether to provide it. The DNA analysis of the saliva sample ultimately incriminated the accused in the sexual assaults. In ruling that the saliva sample was admissible, Doherty J.A. acknowledged that the police breached s. 10(b) of the Charter by failing to advise the accused of his right to counsel in relation to the sexual assault investigation, but ruled that the police made a “fresh start” by severing this earlier Charter breach from their later conduct. In Doherty J.A.’s view, by obtaining the accused’s written consent for the saliva sample, “the officers administered a focussed and powerful antidote to their earlier s. 10(b) breach” (para. 70), and drove “a wedge between the giving of the sample and the earlier breach of s. 10(b)” (para. 74). Doherty J.A. concluded that because the police had “effectively disconnected the decision to give the sample from any potential effect of the prior s. 10(b) breach” (para. 74), the saliva sample was not “obtained in a manner” that breached the Charter.

[102]                     These principles apply to any form of evidence that the police obtain following a Charter violation; they are not limited either to successive statements or to s. 10(b) Charter violations. Although many “fresh start” cases have involved successive statements to persons in authority (see, for example, Plaha; Lewis; Woods; Hamilton; McSweeney), I agree with the observation of Watt J.A. in Manchulenko, at para. 70, that “[n]o principled reason exists to confine the ‘fresh start’ jurisprudence” to such cases and that “[t]he rationale that underpins the ‘fresh start’ principle is the same irrespective of the specific form the evidence proposed for admission takes”.

(c)           Potential Indicators of a “Fresh Start”

[103]                     When undertaking the case-specific factual inquiry into whether the police effected a “fresh start”, some potentially illustrative indicators include:

•                        Whether the police informed the accused of the Charter breach and dispelled its effect with appropriate language (R. (D.), at p. 882). What constitutes appropriate language will vary with the circumstances of the case. In some cases, it may be sufficient to say, “we’re going to start over”; in other cases, more detailed or specific language may be needed to remove the taint from the earlier Charter breach;

•                        Whether the police cautioned the accused after the Charter breach but before the impugned evidence was obtained (Plaha, at para. 53; Hamilton, at paras. 58-59; Woods, at para. 9). Ideally, this would involve both a primary caution (“You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but whatever you say may be given in evidence” (Singh, at para. 31; Manninen, at p. 1237)), and a secondary caution (“Your decision to speak to the police should not be influenced by anything you have already said to the police or the police have already said to you” (Manninen, at p. 1238));

•                        Whether the accused had the chance to consult counsel after the Charter breach but before the impugned evidence was obtained (Manchulenko, at para. 69; Woods, at paras. 5 and 9; R. v. Dawkins, 2018 ONSC 6394, at para. 62 (CanLII));

•                        Whether the accused gave informed consent to the taking of the impugned evidence after the Charter breach (Simon, at para. 74);

•                        Whether and how different police officers interacted with the accused after the Charter breach but before the impugned evidence was obtained (see Lewis, at para. 32; Woods, at para. 9; McSweeney, at para. 62; I. (L.R.) and T. (E.), at p. 526; Dawkins, at para. 62); and

•                        Whether the accused was released from detention after the Charter breach but before the impugned evidence was obtained.

(3)         Application

(a)           The Trial Judge’s “Fresh Start” Analysis Contained Errors of Law

[104]                     Although the trial judge reviewed the case law on “fresh start” principles, I have concluded that he erred in law by failing to apply the correct legal test and by applying an incorrect legal principle (R. v. Chung, 2020 SCC 8, at paras. 13 and 18).

[105]                     First, the trial judge failed to apply the correct legal test by focussing solely on the conduct of the police that was Charter-compliant, without expressly analyzing whether or how that conduct severed the temporal, causal, or contextual connection between the earlier Charter breaches and the appellants’ confessions or rendered those connections remote or tenuous. The trial judge appeared to proceed on the basis that the appellants’ arrest for murder was sufficient to constitute a “fresh start”. He framed the issue as “whether [the appellants’] arrests following Det. Vermette’s direction [to arrest the appellants for murder] resulted in a ‘fresh start’ such that the Charter breaches are ‘cured’” (para. 206). He concluded that the arrests resulted in a “fresh start” and compliance with the Charter, without considering the connection between the earlier Charter violations and the confessions (para. 209).

[106]                     Second, and relatedly, the trial judge applied the wrong legal principle by repeatedly referring to the police as having “cured” the earlier Charter breaches (paras. 191, 206, 215, 239 and 253). It is unhelpful and inaccurate to describe the police as having “cured” the earlier Charter breaches. It is unhelpful because it obscures the real issue: whether there is a sufficient connection between the Charter breaches and the impugned evidence, and not simply whether there was subsequent Charter compliance. It is inaccurate because subsequent Charter-compliant conduct by the police does not “cure” earlier Charter breaches; the Charter breaches still occurred and merit proper consideration under the threshold requirement. Instead, Charter‑compliant conduct may dissociate the Charter breaches from the impugned evidence by severing any connection between them or by rendering any connection remote or tenuous. Only then is the evidence not “obtained in a manner” that breached the Charter.

[107]                     Because the trial judge erred in law in his analysis of the threshold requirement, no deference is owed to his conclusion that the evidence was not “obtained in a manner” that breached the Charter (Mack, at para. 39; R. v. Keror, 2017 ABCA 273, 57 Alta. L.R. (6th) 268, at para. 35). That issue must be analyzed afresh.

(b)         Lambert’s Confession Was Not “Obtained in a Manner” That Breached the Charter

[108]                     In my view, the police took several steps that collectively severed any contextual connection between the breach of Lambert’s Charter rights arising from his unlawful detention and his confession. These steps also rendered any temporal connection with the Charter breaches remote. Finally, there was also no causal relationship between the Charter breaches and Lambert’s confession. Lambert’s confession was thus not “obtained in a manner” that breached the Charter.

[109]                     Specifically, Det. Demarino severed any contextual connection with Lambert’s earlier unlawful detention under the supposed Medical Examiners Act. He did so by telling Lambert that they were going to “start from the very beginning”, by advising him that this is a “very, very serious matter”, and by informing him four times that he was under arrest for murder. By taking these steps, Det. Demarino addressed the previous failure to advise Lambert of the extent of his jeopardy when he had been unlawfully detained. Det. Demarino then facilitated Lambert’s second consultation with counsel, confirmed that he understood the advice he had been given, repeated to him that they “have to start everything all over again”, and provided him with a primary caution three times and a secondary caution once. Collectively, these steps created a new context for the interaction with the police and “dispelled” the effect of the Charter breaches on Lambert’s confession (R. (D.), at p. 882).

[110]                     In addition, any temporal connection between the Charter breaches arising from Lambert’s unlawful detention and his confession after he had been arrested for murder was at best tenuous. Lambert’s confession was provided about 12 hours after the Charter breaches, which the Court of Appeal found left “arguably no temporal connection” (para. 26). In Plaha, at para. 49, Doherty J.A. cautioned that evaluating whether a temporal connection persists “requires more than simply counting the minutes or hours” between the breach and the subsequent statement. As he explained, “[e]vents that occur during the time interval can colour the significance of the passage of time” (para. 49; see also Manchulenko, at para. 73). Here, the intervening steps taken by Det. Demarino and Lambert’s decision to confess even after he was fully aware of his rights rendered any temporal link between the Charter breaches and the confession extremely tenuous (R. v. Goldhart, 1996 CanLII 214 (SCC), [1996] 2 S.C.R. 463, at para. 45). Such “remote or tenuous connections are no connections at all” (R. v. Keshavarz, 2022 ONCA 312, 413 C.C.C. (3d) 263, at para. 53, per Fairburn A.C.J.O.).

[111]                     There was also no causal connection between the Charter breaches arising from Lambert’s unlawful detention and his confession after he was arrested for murder. Lambert provided no incriminating information because of the Charter breaches and he continued to protest his innocence. Lambert confessed only after he consulted counsel, after he understood his rights, and after he appreciated that he had been arrested for murder.

[112]                     By taking the steps described above, the police ensured that Lambert’s confession was not “obtained in a manner” that breached the Charter. It is therefore unnecessary to consider the evaluative component of s. 24(2) for Lambert. Since Lambert’s confession was admissible, I would dismiss his appeal and confirm his conviction for manslaughter.

(c)           Beaver’s Confession Was “Obtained in a Manner” That Breached the Charter

[113]                     The same cannot be said of Beaver’s confession. Although, like Lambert, Beaver was at first unlawfully detained and then arrested for murder, unlike Lambert, Beaver declined the several opportunities he was given to consult counsel. As a result, in Beaver’s case it cannot be said that an intervening consultation with counsel severed any connection between the Charter breaches arising from his unlawful detention and his eventual confession (see Manchulenko, at para. 69).

[114]                     Most importantly, however, Det. Hossack referred back to Cst. Husband’s earlier caution during Beaver’s unlawful detention, when Beaver had been told that he was being “investigatively detained” for “whatever’s going on” in the townhouse where Bowers had been found dead. By telling Beaver that “it’s no different than what uh, Constable Husband read to [him]”, Det. Hossack invoked a caution given when Beaver was unlawfully detained under non-existent legislation and when he had not been advised of the jeopardy he faced for any offence, let alone for murder. By recalling this caution, Det. Hossack failed to dissociate her interaction with Beaver from the earlier Charter breaches and actively maintained a contextual connection between Beaver’s initial unlawful detention and his confession. Thus, even after Beaver had been lawfully arrested and made aware of the jeopardy he faced, his confession was contextually linked to the earlier Charter breaches.

[115]                     Beaver’s confession was thus “obtained in a manner” that breached the Charter. It is therefore necessary to consider whether it should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter.

(4)         Beaver’s Confession Should Not Be Excluded Under Section 24(2) of the Charter

[116]                     Whether the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute by admitting Beaver’s confession involves examining the impact its admission would have on public confidence in the administration of justice over the long term, based on a balancing of the three lines of inquiry described by this Court in R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353: (1) the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct; (2) the impact of the breach on the accused’s Charter-protected interests; and (3) society’s interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits (see Grant, at para. 71; see also R. v. Le, 2019 SCC 34, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 692, at paras. 139-42; Tim, at para. 74; R. v. Lafrance, 2022 SCC 32, at para. 90).

[117]                     Section 24(2) of the Charter is not an automatic exclusionary rule precluding the admission of all unconstitutionally obtained evidence. Such evidence will only be excluded when the accused establishes that, having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute (see R. v. Collins, 1987 CanLII 84 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 280; Tim, at para. 75). Balancing the relevant considerations under s. 24(2) is a qualitative determination that is not capable of mathematical precision (Grant, at paras. 86 and 140; R. v. Harrison, 2009 SCC 34, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 494, at para. 36; Tim, at para. 98).

[118]                     On appeal, a trial judge’s findings of fact in applying s. 24(2) attract deference, but no deference is owed to the application of the law to the facts (Grant, at paras. 43 and 86; Lafrance, at para. 91). Deference is also not owed when the appellate court disagrees with the trial judge’s conclusions on the Charter breaches (Grant, at para. 129; Lafrance, at para. 91). Nor is deference owed to a trial judge’s s. 24(2) analysis conducted in the alternative, because such an analysis involves an artificial evaluation of the seriousness of a Charter breach and the impact on Charter-protected interests that the trial judge did not find (Grant, at para. 129; R. v. Paterson, 2017 SCC 15, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 202, at para. 42; Le, at para. 138; Tim, at para. 72; Lafrance, at para. 91; R. v. G.T.D., 2017 ABCA 274, 57 Alta. L.R. (6th) 213, at para. 51, per Veldhuis J.A., dissenting, appeal allowed substantially for the reasons of Veldhuis J.A., 2018 SCC 7, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 220, at para. 3). Similarly, no deference is owed to a trial judge’s s. 24(2) analysis conducted in the alternative when the trial judge found that the impugned evidence was not “obtained in a manner” that breached the Charter. Such an alternative analysis likewise involves an artificial evaluation of the seriousness of a Charter breach and its impact on Charter-protected interests that the trial judge found were unconnected to the impugned evidence.

[119]                     As a result, no deference is owed to the trial judge’s alternative analysis of the threshold requirement under s. 24(2). This Court must conduct the s. 24(2) analysis afresh, while respecting the trial judge’s factual findings.

(a)           The Seriousness of the Charter-Infringing State Conduct

[120]                     The first line of inquiry under s. 24(2) considers whether the Charter‑infringing state conduct is so serious that the court needs to dissociate itself from it. This inquiry requires the court to situate the Charter-infringing conduct on a scale of culpability. At one end of the scale is conduct that constitutes a wilful or reckless disregard of Charter rights, a systemic pattern of Charter-infringing conduct, or a major departure from Charter standards. At the other end of the scale are less serious Charter breaches, including breaches that are inadvertent, technical, or minor or those that reflect an understandable mistake. The more severe the state’s Charter‑infringing conduct, the greater the need for courts to disassociate themselves from it (see Grant, at paras. 72-74; Le, at para. 143; Harrison, at para. 22; R. v. Côté, 2011 SCC 46, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 215, at para. 47; Tim, at para. 82; Lafrance, at para. 93).

[121]                     The breaches of Beaver’s ss. 9, 10(a), and 10(b) Charter rights arising from his unlawful detention were serious. Sgt. Lines directed Beaver’s detention under non‑existent legislation, the Medical Examiners Act. This involved a reckless disregard for Beaver’s Charter rights and a significant departure from Charter standards. As a member of the Calgary Police Service with 17 years’ experience, Sgt. Lines should have known that the Medical Examiners Act did not exist and that he did not have the authority to detain Beaver at that point. Sgt. Lines’ direction was not an “understandable mistake”, nor was it a mistake made in “good faith”. Instead, as the trial judge found, Sgt. Lines made the direction because “he was looking for a way to maintain control over Mr. Beaver . . ., but was not sure exactly how to do it” (ABQB voir dire reasons, at para. 230). This was a serious Charter violation involving an inappropriate and unjustified overreach of police powers.

[122]                     The first line of inquiry strongly favours exclusion of Beaver’s confession.

(b)         The Impact of the Breach on the Accused’s Charter-Protected Interests

[123]                     The second line of inquiry under s. 24(2) considers the impact of the Charter breach on the accused’s Charter-protected interests. This inquiry involves identifying the interests protected by the relevant Charter right and evaluating the extent to which the Charter breach “actually undermined the interests protected by the right” (Grant, at para. 76). As with the first line of inquiry, the court must situate this impact on a spectrum. The greater the impact on the accused’s Charter-protected interests, the greater the risk that admission of the evidence would suggest that Charter rights are of little actual avail to citizens, thus breeding public cynicism and bringing the administration of justice into disrepute (see Grant, at paras. 76-77; Le, at para. 151; Tim, at para. 90; Lafrance, at para. 96).

[124]                     Three factors indicate that the Charter breaches arising from Beaver’s unlawful detention had only minimal impact on his Charter-protected interests.

[125]                     First, and most importantly, Beaver’s decision to confess was not caused by the Charter breaches arising from his unlawful detention. In appropriate cases, the lack of a causal connection between the breaches and the obtaining of the impugned evidence may mitigate the impact of the breach on the accused’s Charter-protected interests (Grant, at para. 122; R. v. Mian, 2014 SCC 54, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 689, at para. 87; R. v. Rover, 2018 ONCA 745, 143 O.R. (3d) 135, at para. 43; R. v. Pileggi, 2021 ONCA 4, 153 O.R. (3d) 561, at para. 120). As this Court explained in Grant, the strength of the causal connection between the Charter infringement and the impugned evidence plays “a useful role . . . in assessing the actual impact of the breach on the protected interests of the accused” (para. 122). Here, no such causal connection exists. The trial judge found that the Charter breaches arising from the unlawful detention “had little effect” on either appellant’s decision to confess (para. 247). As the trial judge explained, Beaver’s confession had nothing to do with the Charter breaches arising from the unlawful detention and everything to do with “the evidence that was beginning to unfold”, including, most importantly, Lambert’s videotaped confession (paras. 95 and 247). The lack of a causal connection between the Charter breaches and Beaver’s confession mitigates the actual impact of the breaches on his Charter-protected interests.

[126]                     Second, Beaver understood the basis for his interaction with the police. This diminished the impact the breach had on his s. 10(a) Charter right to be informed promptly of the reasons for his detention and his s. 10(b) Charter right to counsel. The trial judge found as fact that, during the two hours when Beaver was arbitrarily detained, he “knew why [he was] being detained” (para. 244). Because Beaver and Lambert placed the 9-1-1 call themselves, “[they both] knew, or had to have known, that they were going to be questioned concerning . . . Bowers’ death” (para. 246). And before Beaver was even questioned, he was recorded saying to himself “[t]hey’re gonna take my statement”. Because Beaver understood the “substance” of the reasons for his detention, this attenuated the impact of the ss. 10(a) and 10(b) breaches on his Charter‑protected interests (para. 246).

[127]                     Finally, the impact of the breach on Beaver’s “liberty from unjustified state interference” and “right to be left alone” protected under s. 9 of the Charter (Le, at paras. 152 and 155 (emphasis deleted)) was also attenuated because Beaver could not reasonably have expected to be left alone. This is not a case where there was an “absence of justification to investigate the [accused] at all” (Le, at para. 155 (emphasis in original)); Beaver and Lambert invited the police to the scene of Bowers’ death, and the police had a common law duty to respond to their call of distress (R. v. Godoy, 1999 CanLII 709 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 311, at paras. 17 and 23). Without diminishing the seriousness of the Charter breaches or disregarding the duty of the police to act in accordance with the law, it must be emphasized that Beaver could not reasonably have expected to be left alone. Indeed, Beaver expected to interact with the police as part of his plan to fabricate a false account of Bowers’ death.

[128]                     In my view, because the Charter breaches arising from Beaver’s unlawful detention had only minimal impact on his Charter-protected interests, the second line of inquiry favours neither exclusion nor inclusion of Beaver’s confession.

(c)           Society’s Interest in an Adjudication of the Case on Its Merits

[129]                     The third line of inquiry under s. 24(2) considers societal concerns and asks whether the truth-seeking function of the criminal trial process would be better served by the admission or the exclusion of the evidence (Grant, at para. 79). Relevant factors under this inquiry include the reliability of the evidence, the importance of the evidence to the prosecution’s case, and the seriousness of the offence at issue (Grant, at paras. 79-84; Harrison, at para. 33; Côté, at para. 47; Paterson, at paras. 51-52).

[130]                     Here, the Charter breaches arising from Beaver’s unlawful detention did not undermine the legality of Beaver’s arrest for murder or the reliability of his confession. Nor is this a case where the Charter breaches effectively compelled Beaver to talk to the state after he had been arrested for murder (Grant, at para. 81). Rather, Beaver spoke voluntarily with Det. Hossack for hours in an effort to deceive her and to obstruct justice. Beaver’s confession was also essential to the Crown’s case against him, as reflected in the agreed statement of facts at trial. And while the seriousness of the offence has the potential to “cut both ways” (Grant, at para. 84), the public has a heightened interest in seeing serious offences such as manslaughter and obstruction of justice adjudicated on the merits.

[131]                     Excluding reliable evidence critical to the Crown’s case, such as Beaver’s confession, can also undermine the truth-seeking function of the justice system and render the trial unfair from the public’s perspective, thus bringing the administration of justice into disrepute (see Grant, at paras. 80-81; Harrison, at paras. 33-34; Tim, at para. 96). These considerations apply forcefully here.

[132]                     The third line of inquiry therefore strongly supports admission of Beaver’s confession.

(d)         Final Balancing

[133]                     The final step in the s. 24(2) analysis involves weighing each line of inquiry to determine whether admitting the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. This balancing has a prospective function: it aims to ensure that evidence obtained through a Charter breach does not cause further damage to the justice system. It is also societal in scope: its goal is not to punish the police but to address systemic concerns involving the broad impact of admitting the evidence on the long‑term repute of the justice system (see Grant, at paras. 69-70 and 85-86; Le, at para. 139; Tim, at para. 98).

[134]                     When undertaking this weighing exercise, “it is the cumulative weight of the first two lines of inquiry that trial judges must consider and balance against the third line of inquiry” (Lafrance, at para. 90 (emphasis in original)). “[W]hen the two first lines, taken together, make a strong case for exclusion”, the third line of inquiry “will seldom tip the scale in favour of admissibility” (Lafrance, at para. 90). The third line of inquiry “becomes important when one, but not both, of the first two inquiries pushes strongly toward the exclusion of the evidence” (R. v. McGuffie, 2016 ONCA 365, 131 O.R. (3d) 643, at para. 63, per Doherty J.A.; see also R. v. Chapman, 2020 SKCA 11, 386 C.C.C. (3d) 24, at paras. 125-26 and 130). It is possible that admitting evidence obtained by particularly serious Charter-infringing conduct will bring the administration of justice into disrepute, even if the conduct did not have a serious impact on the accused’s Charter-protected interests (Le, at para. 141). But where the cumulative weight of the first two lines of inquiry is overwhelmed by a compelling public interest in admitting the evidence, the administration of justice will not be brought into disrepute by its admission.

[135]                     In my view, the third line of inquiry is central to the s. 24(2) weighing exercise in this case. The first two lines of inquiry, taken together, do not make a strong case for excluding Beaver’s confession. Only the seriousness of the Charter breaches strongly favours exclusion. The second line of inquiry pulls neither towards nor against exclusion because the breaches had minimal impact on Beaver’s Charter-protected interests. The cumulative weight of the first two lines of inquiry is overwhelmed by a compelling public interest in admitting Beaver’s confession. This evidence is crucial to the prosecution’s case against an offender who allegedly killed another person and then tried to obstruct the police investigation. On a proper balancing of the lines of inquiry under s. 24(2), I conclude that admitting Beaver’s confession would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

[136]                     I would therefore admit Beaver’s confession and confirm his conviction for manslaughter.

VI.         Disposition

[137]                     I would dismiss both appeals.

                  Martin J. —

I.               Overview

[138]                     On the morning of October 9, 2016, the appellants, Brian John Lambert and James Andrew Beaver, called 9-1-1 and reported arriving home from a night away to find their roommate’s dead body. Shortly after arriving at the scene, police unlawfully detained the appellants pursuant to non-existent legislation, transported them to police headquarters for questioning, and searched them upon arrival. During Mr. Lambert’s transport, police questioned him before facilitating his request to exercise his right to counsel. This conduct resulted in multiple serious breaches of the appellants’ rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

[139]                     I part ways with the majority on two points. First, on whether it was lawful for the lead investigator, after learning of the circumstances of the appellants’ unlawful detention, to immediately arrest them for murder and direct their continued questioning. I conclude that the information relied on to direct the appellants’ arrests does not come close to the particularized probability required to meet the reasonable grounds standard. The arrests were a blatant attempt to salvage the investigation in the face of what officers knew were multiple serious violations of the appellants’ Charter rights. The accumulation of breaches of well-established Charter standards in this case requires that the evidence be excluded as a remedy under s. 24(2) of the Charter to avoid bringing further disrepute to the administration of justice.

[140]                     Second, the test for inclusion under s. 24(2) is long established and well known. The focus is on the connection between the breach and the evidence obtained, with reference to temporal, contextual, and causal elements (R. v. Strachan, 1988 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 980; R. v. Goldhart, 1996 CanLII 214 (SCC), [1996] 2 S.C.R. 463; R. v. Wittwer, 2008 SCC 33, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 235). There is simply no need to speak in terms of whether or not there was somehow a “fresh start” for those who have breached Charter rights. Indeed, the notion of a “fresh start” is an unhelpful and potentially misleading concept that has no place in the s. 24(2) analysis. It divides what is to be a holistic analysis into before and after segments and operates to cure and/or remove Charter breaches from the analysis, thus placing a heavy finger on the scale of s. 24(2).  

[141]                     The combination of these two conclusions is more than enough to allow the appeals, exclude all the evidence obtained in a manner that infringed the appellants’ Charter rights, set aside the convictions, and order new trials. Thus, while I should not be taken as accepting the majority’s voluntariness analysis, I find it unnecessary to address the voluntariness issue raised by Mr. Beaver.

II.            Background

A.           Facts

[142]                     Shortly before 10:00 a.m. on October 9, 2016, Mr. Lambert called 9‑1‑1 and reported finding his roommate and landlord, Sutton Raymond Bowers, lying face down in a puddle of blood inside their home. He told the 9‑1‑1 operator that he and Mr. Bowers had been having “altercations” all week. When he came home the previous evening, Mr. Bowers told him and his other roommate, Mr. Beaver, to “get the hell out” (R.R., at p. 18). They left Mr. Bowers at home with guests and returned that morning to find his body in the townhouse.

[143]                     Police officers arrived at the scene within minutes. They observed the deceased lying at the base of “a fairly steep set of polished hardwood stairs” (2019 ABQB 125, 88 Alta. L.R. (6th) 337, at para. 7). An empty bottle of rum was left out on a table (para. 10). Mr. Lambert informed one of the officers, Cst. Taylor, that it was not unusual for the deceased to be passed out from intoxication. None of the officers observed either of the appellants acting suspiciously. There were no signs of a struggle at the scene.

[144]                     None of the officers at the scene believed they had grounds to arrest the appellants.

[145]                     Sgt. Lines was in charge at the scene. He directed two officers, Cst. Husband and Cst. Taylor, to detain the appellants under the Medical Examiners Act. He testified that he meant to refer to the Fatality Inquiries Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. F‑9, as he believed this legislation authorized police to detain people at the scene of a potential homicide. He acknowledged that he erred in two respects: there is no such legislation as the Medical Examiners Act in Alberta, and the Fatality Inquiries Act provides no detention power to police.

[146]                     Cst. Husband took Mr. Beaver into custody. She told him that she had to “read [him] the legalities” and that she was “investigatively detaining [him] for, uh, whatever’s going on in there, (laughing)” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 28). She testified that she did not know what Mr. Beaver was under investigative detention for; he was taken into custody because police did not know whether he was a witness or an offender and they needed to find out his involvement.

[147]                     Cst. Taylor was in charge of Mr. Lambert’s detention. He read Mr. Lambert his Charter warning and caution, informing him that he was detained under the Medical Examiners Act. Mr. Lambert replied that he understood and wished to speak to a lawyer.

[148]                     Cst. Taylor then transported Mr. Lambert to the station in his police vehicle. During the car ride, he asked Mr. Lambert about what had happened. Mr. Lambert described his version of what had occurred the previous night between himself, Mr. Beaver, and the deceased. He noted that a male he did not recognize had been at the residence with Mr. Bowers the previous evening.

[149]                     Det. Vermette was assigned as the primary investigator on the file. At 10:36 a.m., he received a phone call from S/Sgt. Chisholm calling out the homicide unit to investigate a death. During this call, S/Sgt. Chisholm indicated that he had spoken to the medical investigator and a man had been found face down in a pool of blood at the bottom of the stairs near the front entrance of a residence. He informed Det. Vermette that there had been some conflict or dispute between the victim and his roommates, who were being transported to the police detachment. S/Sgt. Chisholm also sent Det. Vermette an email relating this information.

[150]                     Csts. Husband and Taylor and the appellants arrived at police headquarters at about 11:15 a.m. The appellants were both searched and Mr. Lambert was given an opportunity to speak with a lawyer. They were placed in separate holding rooms. 

[151]                     At 11:39 a.m., Det. Vermette spoke with Csts. Husband and Taylor. They informed him that the appellants had been “Chartered and cautioned” and provided with an opportunity to speak with legal counsel (A.R., vol. I, at p. 210). Det. Vermette was “assuming” that they had been arrested for murder (p. 251). He assigned Det. Hossack and Det. Demarino to interview Mr. Lambert and Mr. Beaver, respectively.

[152]                     Det. Vermette testified that when he met with Csts. Husband and Taylor, he did not have reasonable grounds to arrest the appellants.

[153]                     Det. Vermette then reviewed the material in the police file. The material included an “Event Information”, which provided a summary of the case based on the 9‑1‑1 call and some remarks inputted from officers, and an “Event Chronology”, which essentially repeated the content of the Event Information.

[154]                     The Event Information indicated that the 9-1-1 call was categorized as “medical – sudden death” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 321). It identified the townhouse as a location of interest, or “LOI”, because Mr. Lambert had previously made a complaint about his landlord, Mr. Bowers. It also indicated that police and emergency medical services had been called to the townhouse in August of that year, about three months prior to the 9‑1‑1 call, to perform a mental health check on Mr. Bowers after he had drank floor cleaner in what Det. Vermette described as an “attempted suicide kind of situation” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 217). The Event Information showed that Mr. Bowers had a criminal history for violence, but showed no criminal history for either of the appellants. Det. Vermette testified he believed the Event Information was important because it showed there was an “environment of violence” at the townhouse (p. 219).

[155]                     Mr. Lambert’s complaint about Mr. Bowers was further detailed in a Police Information Management System (“PIMS”) report, which also formed part of the file. The PIMS report indicated that three days before the 9-1-1 call, Mr. Lambert had reported to police that Mr. Bowers had been drinking and punched him in the groin. Mr. Lambert called police to inquire about the process if charges were pursued, but the report noted that he did not wish to lay charges, provide a statement, or further involve police. He planned to move out within the next two weeks. Det. Vermette explained that he viewed the PIMS report as important because it corroborated the “environment of violence” from the Event Information.

[156]                     Shortly after beginning Mr. Lambert’s interview, Det. Demarino learned of the circumstances of the appellants’ detention from Cst. Husband. Recognizing the serious legal issues engaged, he brought his concerns to Det. Vermette. Det. Vermette then instructed the interviewing detectives to arrest the appellants for murder, re-do their cautions, and proceed with the interviews. He testified that he took at most two minutes to make the decision to arrest the appellants after he learned of the circumstances of their detention. He said he needed to act quickly because he knew the appellants were at the police headquarters “illegally” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 256).

[157]                     Det. Vermette took no notes of this interaction with Det. Demarino, or others, and did not record the grounds on which he based his decision to direct the appellants’ arrests.

[158]                     Det. Demarino returned to Mr. Lambert’s interview room and arrested him for murder. He provided Mr. Lambert with another opportunity to consult counsel and cautioned him on his right to silence. Cst. Arns photographed and swabbed Mr. Lambert. She told him, “right now it’s just you’re one of our witnesses and it’s a normal procedure that we usually do” (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 132-33; see also ABQB reasons, at para. 37). Mr. Lambert maintained for several hours that he wished to exercise his right to silence, but eventually began to speak.

[159]                     In a separate room, Det. Hossack arrested Mr. Beaver for murder and informed him of his right to counsel. She emphasized that nothing had changed from when he was previously cautioned — she was simply reading the caution to “start off fresh” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 50). When Mr. Beaver expressed surprise that he was under arrest, Det. Hossack reassured him all this meant was that he could not leave. Det. Hossack told Mr. Beaver she was only reading the caution again because she was a new person he was speaking to. Mr. Beaver told Det. Hossack that he did not think he needed counsel, but he was “not understanding the severity of it” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 53). In response, Det. Hossack explained to Mr. Beaver that he was brought to police headquarters because he was at the scene where the body was found and told him, “we need to figure out what’s going on and because . . . you were there um, just kind of in a, in a cautionary way we have to charter everyone” (p. 54).

[160]                     Mr. Beaver waived his right to counsel. For the first 12 hours of the interview, he maintained that he could not remember what had happened as he had been drinking the previous night. At around 1:00 a.m., after Det. Hossack started taking a more aggressive approach, he began adopting the inculpatory statements she put to him.  

B.            Lower Court Decisions

[161]                     The trial judge denied the appellants’ application to exclude the evidence as a remedy for the Charter breaches. He concluded that the appellants’ detention at the scene was unlawful because there was no “clear nexus” between the appellants and Mr. Bowers’ death; nor was it clear that Mr. Bowers had died as a result of a criminal offence (para. 149). Nevertheless, he found that Det. Vermette had subjective and objectively reasonable grounds to arrest the appellants for murder based on the trauma Mr. Bowers suffered and the appellants’ motive and opportunity to commit the offence (para. 159). Unlike the officers at the scene who did not form reasonable grounds, Det. Vermette had access to the PIMS report, which demonstrated animosity between Mr. Bowers and Mr. Lambert (para. 158).

[162]                     Although he found it unnecessary to analyze whether to exclude the evidence under s. 24(2) of the Charter because the arrests constituted a “fresh start” that “cured” the breaches (at para. 215), the judge conducted an alternative analysis of the factors as outlined in R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353. He concluded the breaches would not have warranted exclusion because the state conduct was not deliberate, severe, or a blatant disregard for Charter rights; the breaches had little impact on the appellants; and there were no reliability concerns with the evidence, despite their importance to the Crown’s case being unclear.

[163]                     The Court of Appeal of Alberta unanimously dismissed the appeal (2020 ABCA 203, 4 Alta. L.R. (7th) 301). The court agreed that there were reasonable grounds for the arrests, opining that Det. Vermette “made a practical and common-sense decision to arrest the appellants based on the information he had received by the time of the arrests” (para. 9). It found no error in the trial judge’s “fresh start” analysis, and did not consider his alternative analysis under s. 24(2).

III.         Analysis

[164]                     My analysis will address three issues. First, were the appellants’ arrests unlawful? Second, was the evidence provided in their statements “obtained in a manner” that infringed their Charter rights? Finally, would admission of the evidence bring the administration of justice into disrepute?

[165]                     I have no hesitation in answering each of these questions in the affirmative.

A.           The Appellants’ Arrests Were Unlawful

[166]                     It is well established that police must have reasonable grounds to believe an individual committed or was about to commit an indictable offence in order to lawfully arrest them without prior judicial authorization (Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 495(1)(a)). The reasonable belief must relate to two elements: whether an offence has been committed, and whether the person under arrest committed the offence. The test must be met on both a subjective and an objective basis. This means that it is necessary, but not sufficient, for the police to have a personal, honestly held belief in the presence of reasonable grounds. The Crown must also establish that the asserted grounds were objectively reasonable from the perspective of a reasonable person standing in the position of the officer (R. v. Storrey, 1990 CanLII 125 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 241, at pp. 250-51).

[167]                     Reasonable grounds is a high threshold that is met at the point where a credibly based probability replaces suspicion (Hunter v. Southam Inc., 1984 CanLII 33 (SCC), [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at pp. 166-67; Baron v. Canada, 1993 CanLII 154 (SCC), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 416, pp. 446-47). It requires the police to point to particularized evidence to support “an objective basis for the belief which is based on compelling and credible information” (Mugesera v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 SCC 40, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 100, at para. 114). Whether the legal standard of reasonable grounds was met on the particular facts of a given case is a question of law to be assessed on a correctness standard (R. v. Shepherd, 2009 SCC 35, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 527, at para. 20; R. v. MacKenzie, 2013 SCC 50, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 250, at para. 54).

[168]                     The need to establish reasonable grounds before effecting an arrest is not a mere procedural requirement — it is a constitutional imperative. An arrest is a key investigative step on which much hinges, both for the police and for the arrestee. It triggers intrusive police powers relating to detention, interrogation, search, and the use of force. An arrest empowers police to search the individual and their immediate surroundings without requiring them to obtain a warrant or show independent reasonable and probable grounds. Police can detain arrested individuals without any review for up to 24 hours — potentially longer if a justice is unavailable (Criminal Code, s. 503(1)). During this prolonged detention, the police may subject the arrestee to hours on end of questioning involving forms of manipulation, including lying to the arrestee in order to extract information. This is why, in the foundational decision of Storrey, Cory J. described the reasonable grounds requirement as a vital protection necessary to safeguard citizens’ liberty and without which “even the most democratic society could all too easily fall prey to the abuses and excesses of a police state” (p. 249). The powers an arrest affords to the police is only justifiable on the basis of demonstrating reasonable grounds to believe an offence has been committed. Absent this information, the intrusion on liberty interests tolerated in the name of the investigation of crime cannot be justified. The reasonable grounds standard is a key constitutional safeguard and it must not be watered down because of mere investigative expediency or to salvage an investigation in the face of Charter-infringing conduct.

[169]                     It is worth setting out at some length Det. Vermette’s testimony describing the basis on which he asserted that there were reasonable grounds to direct the appellants’ arrests. He explained his grounds for arrest in this way:

. . . when I get called out, it’s called out on a suspicious death. The -- the -- there is -- it is clear that there’s a conversation between Staff Sergeant Chisholm and the medical examiner. That is important to me. I know the process that we go through and how the medical examiner or the Medical Examiner’s Office triage those type of calls. So that call coming in as suspicious is important to me.

 

I know that someone is deceased at the scene, and I start getting relationships based on that. I can tell you that Brian Lambert is the caller. He identifies himself as the roommate. And without getting into too much detail, I believed that Jim Beaver is the other roommate that is present as well. . . .

 

. . .

 

. . . we talk about a prior altercation with roommates. So what I am looking at here, if I look at the totality, I look at the environment, I look at the violence, I look at the anger, I look at some of the vernacular that was used, I can see that both roommates were there at the time of this 911 call. I look -- I start looking at opportunity. Is there possible opportunity that Mr. Beaver or Mr. Lambert could have committed this offence? Why do I say “this offence”? I believe it to be suspicious in nature. There’s red flags all over the document.

 

Now, when I look at the PIMS report and then I look at that as corroborating some of the information that I saw, I start looking at motive. I start looking at motivation. And, again, in culmination with all of the information that I am getting -- and to review, phone call from Staff Sergeant Chisholm, email from Staff Sergeant Chisholm, review of the I/Net Event Information, review of the I/Net Event Chronology, review of the PIMS report, the belief that investigatively that the victim is going to be Sutton Bowers, I believe there are subjective and objective grounds to arrest both Mr. Lambert and Mr. Beaver for murder.

 

(A.R., vol. I, at pp. 226-27)

[170]                     The grounds relied on by Det. Vermette to direct the appellants’ arrests do not come close to providing the particularized evidence required to ground a reasonable belief based on credible and compelling information that the reasonable grounds standard demands. I explain this conclusion in the following manner. I begin by briefly commenting on the relevance of the absence of notes taken by Det. Vermette to the assessment of reasonable grounds. Then, I explain why the above information fails to meet the objective reasonable grounds standard. First, all of the information, in its totality, is not sufficient to meet the particularized probability required to form reasonable grounds. Second, the timeline of events in Det. Vermette’s testimony undermines the reasonableness of his stated belief that there was reason to believe the appellants killed Mr. Bowers at the time of their arrest. Third, the individual pillars of evidence relied on for the asserted grounds do not support the officer’s reasoning.

(1)         There Were No Notes to Review on the Claimed Grounds for Arrest

[171]                     Det. Vermette did not take notes detailing the actual and individual information he claimed to rely on to support his decision-making at the time of the arrest. There is therefore no contemporaneous record of the particular grounds asserted to justify why the arrest power was believed to be a legally available option for each accused at the relevant point in time.

[172]                     It is well recognized that police notes are crucial to the court’s ability to meaningfully review the exercise of police power without prior judicial authorization, including the arrest power (R. v. Fearon, 2014 SCC 77, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 621, at para. 82; R. v. Vu, 2013 SCC 60, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 657, at para. 70; see also Wood v. Schaeffer, 2013 SCC 71, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1053, at paras. 63-66).

[173]                     The absence of notes is a factor to be considered in deciding whether to accept the witness’s testimony (R. v. Lotfy, 2017 BCCA 418, 357 C.C.C. (3d) 516, at para. 54; see R. v. Faulkner, 2020 ABQB 231, at para. 37 (CanLII); R. v. Abdulatif, 2017 ONSC 2089, at paras. 39-42 (CanLII); R. v. Mascoe, 2017 ONSC 4208, 350 C.C.C. (3d) 208, at paras. 114-15; United States of America v. Sheppard, 2013 QCCS 5260, 295 C.R.R. (2d) 113, at para. 20; R. v. Davidoff, 2013 ABQB 244, 560 A.R. 252, at para. 25; R. v. Odgers, 2009 ONCJ 287, at para. 16 (CanLII); R. v. Fisher, 2005 CanLII 16070 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 1).

[174]                     In reviewing reasonable grounds, the absence of notes may inform the court’s assessment of the officer’s credibility, which is relevant to both the subjective and the objective elements of the test. Without notes, it is difficult to cross‑examine or question what is often a bare assertion by the officers that they had grounds to arrest the individual. Notes are therefore critical to checking the exercise of police power by ensuring that statements of personal belief do not go routinely or effectively unchallenged. With respect to the objective element of the test, notes provide contemporaneous documentary evidence of what information the officer actually considered at the time the decision to arrest was made. The question at this stage is whether there were objectively reasonable grounds based on the information the police did rely on, not what they could have relied on. This is to prevent Charter breaches to the extent possible by ensuring a thorough assessment is conducted before the decision to arrest is made. To do otherwise would incentivize police to make snap decisions and piece together information in an attempt to justify those decisions after-the-fact. The absence of notes detailing the information used to form the decision at the time it was made may therefore hinder the arrestee’s ability to challenge the decision to arrest, and the court’s ability to get to the truth of the basis for that decision.

[175]                     It is unnecessary to decide whether the judge’s acceptance of the officer’s subjective belief was tainted by palpable and overriding error because it is clear that the asserted grounds, even if believed, do not come close to meeting the test on an objective standard.

(2)         The Totality of the Information Relied on Is Insufficient to Meet the Reasonable Grounds Standard

[176]                     The grounds forming the basis on which Det. Vermette directed the appellants’ arrests in their totality do not rise to the level of a credibly based probability required to meet the reasonable grounds standard. Det. Vermette’s testimony continuously restated the same information in various verbal formulations. The reasons proffered were embellished, long-winded, abstract and repetitive. They exaggerated the extent and utility of the information relied upon and obscured the lack of particularized evidence grounding the stated belief. When the inflated explanations are stripped back, the reasoning is essentially that the police were called on the scene to investigate a suspicious death and the individuals who found the body had an acrimonious relationship with the deceased, in which the deceased appeared to be the aggressor. I cannot accept that the police, whenever they are called upon to investigate a traumatic death, are entitled to arrest the individuals who reported the body for murder simply because they had a tumultuous history with the deceased.

[177]                     Det. Vermette admitted that when he spoke to Csts. Taylor and Husband at 11:39 a.m. — after his conversation with S/Sgt. Chisholm but before reviewing the materials in the police file — he did not have grounds to arrest the appellants. The implication from his testimony was, however, that the material he subsequently reviewed in the file provided the additional information necessary to meet the threshold of reasonable grounds.

[178]                     All of the information taken together does not amount to reasonable grounds. In addition, the information in the police reports could not have made up the difference needed to ground a credibly based probability. Det. Vermette’s testimony indicates that most of the circumstances he relied on to form reasonable grounds were known to him before he reviewed these documents. In particular, he already knew: the homicide unit had been called out to investigate a death; the body was found face down in a pool of blood near the bottom of the stairs at the front entrance of a residence; there was a prior conflict or dispute between the deceased and his roommates; and the roommates had been brought into custody by the officers who attended at the scene. While slightly more detailed, the additional information in the police file did not significantly alter the factual matrix. Corroborating the undisputed information that the appellants and the deceased were roommates and that they had been arguing that week could not raise the level of suspicion to that of reasonable grounds to believe that the appellants had killed Mr. Bowers.

[179]                     Further, the grounds asserted by Det. Vermette and accepted by the lower courts fail to engage with the exculpatory evidence pointing away from Mr. Bowers’ death being a homicide, and from the appellants being involved. In assessing whether the reasonable grounds standard is met, the police must take into account the totality of the circumstances. This means that they are not entitled to disregard exculpatory, neutral, or equivocal information unless they have good reason to believe it is unreliable (R. v. Chehil, 2013 SCC 49, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 220, at paras. 26, 29 and 33). Here, there were serious questions relating to both the offence and the individuals.

[180]                     With respect to the offence, information at the scene suggested that Mr. Bowers may have died in an intoxicated fall. This is reflected in the trial judge’s finding that, at the time of the appellants’ detention, it was unclear whether the death was the result of a criminal offence. No further information suggesting the death was the result of a homicide was uncovered between the initial detention and the appellants’ arrests. Det. Vermette’s assertion that the death was “suspicious” because there were “red flags all over the document” is not the type of credible, compelling, particularized information that police can rely upon to support a reasonable belief that an offence has been committed for the purpose of justifying an arrest for murder.

[181]                     With respect to the individuals, the appellants’ connection to the death was tenuous. There was no information about the time of death suggesting that it had occurred when the appellants would have had the “opportunity” to commit the offence. It will be true in every case that a particular individual or individuals report finding the body. This fact alone does not provide evidence of an “opportunity” to commit the offence. The information known to police at the time of the arrests was that the deceased was last seen alive with an unknown man.

[182]                     Further, in all of the history in the police file, the deceased was the aggressor in the altercations. He was the only one with a history of violence. Neither of the accused had a criminal record. The information in the PIMS report relied on to support the “motive” suggested that Mr. Lambert didn’t think much of the assault and did not want to involve the police, have charges laid or provide a statement. Any indication that the assault provided Mr. Lambert with a motive to kill was minimal.

[183]                     Moreover, there was nothing at all to suggest Mr. Beaver was involved in any of the prior incidents other than the argument the evening before the 9-1-1 call, which was already known to officers at the scene. It is untenable to conclude, as the trial judge did, that the information in the PIMS report could make up the difference between the absence of reasonable suspicion to detain the appellants at the scene, and the presence of reasonable grounds to arrest them at police headquarters.

(3)         The Timing of the Arrests Suggests the Decision Was Made for Expediency

[184]                     The timing of Det. Vermette’s direction to arrest the appellants also calls into question the reasonableness of the decision. On Det. Vermette’s own evidence, he made the decision to arrest the appellants within two minutes of learning that the appellants had been illegally detained and transported to the station. Up to this point, he had been under the mistaken impression that officers at the scene had already arrested the appellants for murder. Det. Vermette testified that he made the decision to arrest quickly in order to “rectify” the situation (A.R., vol. I, at p. 225).

[185]                     The circumstances of the appellants’ unlawful detention and transport should have been a cause for concern not only because of the Charter breaches that resulted, but to prompt questioning into why the other officers did not believe they had grounds to arrest the appellants under their authority in s. 495 of the Criminal Code. Det. Vermette’s failure to make any such inquiries in this case is indicative of the arrests being a means to salvage the investigation, rather than the result of asking himself whether he in fact had lawful grounds to keep the appellants in custody, even if not done in bad faith.

(4)         The Evidence Relied on for the Asserted Grounds Did Not Support a Reasonable Belief

[186]                     Finally, the individual pillars of evidence relied on for the asserted grounds do not support the officer’s reasoning, either standing alone or in combination.

[187]                     I have already explained why the information relied on to support the appellants’ “motive” and “opportunity” is not compelling. In addition, much was made in Det. Vermette’s testimony of the fact that the medical examiner had called the homicide unit to investigate the death, which in his view meant that the death was suspicious. The word “suspicious” was Det. Vermette’s own — the police reports described the death as a “sudden death”, not a suspicious one.

[188]                     For an investigator to rely on the “suspicious” nature of a death in support of reasonable grounds, this label must hold up to scrutiny on the basis of particularized, objectively verifiable information. The police, not the medical examiner, are legally trained on what the constitutional standard of reasonable grounds entails. The possibility of foul play will be true any time the homicide unit is called in to investigate a death. It is not the fact of the medical investigator calling for further investigation, but the basis on which she made that decision, that could reasonably support the belief that an offence had been committed. The medical examiner can explain to the police the information on which they believe foul play may or may not have been involved, and the police can and should use that information to inform their view of whether or not there are reasonable grounds. This appears to have happened in a phone call between the medical examiner and Det. Vermette at 12:35 p.m. in which she provided the details of her scene assessment. However, this occurred approximately 20 minutes after he had directed Dets. Hossack and Demarino to arrest the appellants for murder. At the time of the arrests, there was no information about why the medical examiner had engaged the homicide unit and what facts or factors grounded her assessment. It could be that the medical examiner calls out the police to every “sudden death”, or it could be that there were particular facts about the scene that supported a belief that the death was not the result of an accident. We simply do not know.

[189]                     The information that Det. Vermette explained formed the basis of his decision to arrest the appellants may have given rise to a reasonable suspicion, but to accept that it formed the basis of reasonable grounds to believe that the appellants killed Mr. Bowers would erode the reasonable grounds standard to a level inconsistent with what is required to provide a meaningful check on the state’s investigatory powers in accordance with the Charter’s requirements. While the assessment is global and does not require an isolated parsing of each particular component or a prima facie case to answer on each element of the offence, there must be something of substance proffered in order to meet the objective reasonable grounds standard. The police have failed to offer a substantively reasonable basis to support the asserted belief that at the time of the appellants’ arrests, there were reasonable grounds to believe they had killed Mr. Bowers.

B.            The Evidence Was “Obtained in a Manner” That Infringed the Appellants’ Charter Rights

[190]                     The Crown conceded, and the trial judge found, that the police breached the appellants’ ss. 9, 10(a) and 10(b) Charter rights. The trial judge also held that the arrests and the searches subsequent to those arrests were lawful and that the right to silence was not breached because the statements were voluntary. I conclude that the arrests were not supported by reasonable and probable grounds and that as a result, the searches conducted pursuant to those arrests were also constitutionally infirm under s. 8 of the Charter (R. v. Feeney, 1997 CanLII 342 (SCC), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 13, at para. 60; R. v. Tim, 2022 SCC 12, at para. 48). Further, the s. 9 guarantee against arbitrary detention is a manifestation of a person’s s. 7 Charter right to liberty (Grant, at para. 54; Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, 1985 CanLII 81 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at pp. 502‑3). As I explain, these additional breaches of a person’s ss. 7 and 8 rights combine to be sufficient to exclude the impugned evidence and I need not address the majority’s views on the voluntariness of the statements given.

[191]                     In determining whether evidence was “obtained in a manner” that breaches the Charter, I agree with my colleague that courts should examine the entire relationship between the evidence and the breach to determine the strength of the connection and assess whether the breach and the evidence are part of the same transaction or course of conduct. The connection may be temporal, contextual, causal, or a combination of the three (Strachan; Goldhart; Wittwer). A strict causal connection is not required (R. v. Therens, 1985 CanLII 29 (SCC), [1985] 1 S.C.R. 613, at p. 649; Strachan, at pp. 1005-6). Instead, a global assessment is necessary “to determine whether a Charter violation occurred in the course of obtaining the evidence” (Strachan, at p. 1005). Indeed, a Charter breach following the discovery of evidence may still meet the “obtained in a manner” requirement of s. 24(2) (R. v. Pino, 2016 ONCA 389, 130 O.R. (3d) 561). The “obtained in a manner” analysis necessitates the full contextual analysis each time it is performed, regardless of whether subsequent Charter-compliant actions exist.

[192]                     The trial judge and Court of Appeal departed from this holistic assessment. They defined a “fresh start” as an attempt by police to “cure” an earlier breach so that any subsequently discovered evidence would not be “obtained in a manner” that infringed a person’s Charter rights (C.A. reasons, at para. 12; see also I.F., Canadian Civil Liberties Association (“CCLA Factum”), at para. 13). Instead of examining the connection between the breach and the evidence holistically, the “fresh start” principle focuses on whether the police, after the breach, corrected their behaviour. This definition of “fresh start” reduces the broad “obtained in a manner” analysis and asks only two questions: (1) whether there was subsequent Charter-compliant state conduct following the breach but before the discovery of the evidence; and (2) whether that subsequent Charter-compliant conduct severed the relationship between the breach and the discovery of the evidence (CCLA Factum, at para. 13).

[193]                     The arrests, even if they were lawful, do not constitute a “fresh start” that shields subsequent actions by the police from Charter scrutiny.

[194]                     I do not think this vague notion of a “fresh start” is already part of our law and I am convinced it should not be so recognized. The idea of a “fresh start” is unnecessary because the established holistic approach is more than adequate to the task and this new flourish creates many deep pitfalls with no countervailing purpose.

[195]                     I disagree with my colleague’s contention that this Court has accepted that, in principle, the police can make a “fresh start” after a Charter violation (para. 100). I would not read Wittwer as endorsing the “fresh start” concept as one that can shield evidence from the application of s. 24(2) of the Charter. No such conclusion was ever made in that case.

[196]                     Wittwer concerned the admissibility of an incriminating statement that the police obtained from the accused in a manner that violated his right to counsel. Another officer made a new attempt to get a statement from the accused without referring to the information gathered from the unconstitutionally obtained statement, but eventually referred to it after the officer determined there was no other way to convince the accused to talk. Fish J. concluded that the evidence was obtained in a manner that violated the Charter because “[w]hat began as a permissible fresh start thus ended as an impermissible interrogation inseparably linked to its tainted past” (para. 3 (emphasis added; emphasis in original deleted)).

[197]                     Some have sought to elevate this ambiguous wording as endorsing the view that “fresh starts” may be permissible in appropriate cases, even if the one in Wittwer was found not to be (see R. v. Simon, 2008 ONCA 578, 269 O.A.C. 259; R. v. Manchulenko, 2013 ONCA 543, 116 O.R. (3d) 721; R. v. Hamilton, 2017 ONCA 179, 347 C.C.C. (3d) 19; R. v. McSweeney, 2020 ONCA 2, 451 C.R.R. (2d) 357). In my view, the above statement does not establish the notion of a “fresh start” as an accepted doctrine or binding principle of our law. The Court in Wittwer found that there was no break between the manner in which the Charter was breached in these two offending interrogations. Fish J. used a colloquial description of what police were trying to do by their conduct and by doing so he did not create a new doctrine which operates outside of the holistic analysis done under s. 24. The “fresh start” described related to the police’s conduct, and not the admissibility of the second statement under s. 24. Indeed, on the contrary, Fish J. determined that the taking of the second statement was tainted by reference to the “inadmissible statement” taken some five months prior (para. 22).

[198]                     The concept of a “permissible fresh start” detracts from the broad and generous approach that this Court has adopted for the “obtained in a manner” requirement of s. 24 of the Charter. Regardless of the presence of Charter-compliant conduct following a breach, the test must remain the same in every case: the evidence is “obtained in a manner” that infringes a Charter right if upon review of the entire course of events, the breach and the obtaining of the evidence can be said to be part of the same transaction or course of conduct. The connection between the breach and the obtaining of the evidence may be temporal, contextual, causal or a combination of the three, and the connection must be more than tenuous (R. v. Plaha (2004), 2004 CanLII 21043 (ON CA), 189 O.A.C. 376, at para. 45, citing Goldhart, at paras. 32‑49). I see no reason why this test should not govern in all cases even if, or maybe especially when, police have recognized a breach and have taken steps to stop it.

[199]                     This is precisely the approach adopted by Fish J. in Wittwer (at para. 21) and is the only legal test endorsed by this Court. Although arguably, Fish J. refers to a “fresh start”, he then unequivocally applies the generous and broad approach to the “obtained in a manner” requirement developed in Strachan and Goldhart to conduct his analysis. The text of s. 24(2) is not worded so narrowly as to preclude evidence from consideration even when the police take steps to cease an ongoing Charter violation. Substituting a “fresh start” analysis for a complete and contextual “obtained in a manner” analysis creates an inflexible test that makes Charter remedies less accessible to those whose rights were violated. No single rule should disrupt the courts’ remedial inquiry (CCLA Factum, at para. 22).

[200]                     As with all remedial provisions, s. 24 of the Charter must be given a large and liberal interpretation consistent with its purpose. Taking a broad and generous approach to the “obtained in a manner” threshold requirement is important, as it is the gateway to the focus of s. 24(2): whether the admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute (Pino, at para. 56). An overly narrow interpretation of s. 24(2) would prevent courts from even considering the seriousness of the Charter-infringing conduct, an unwelcome result which would automatically immunize prior Charter breaches. There is simply no need or utility in speaking about a “fresh start” because the current s. 24 jurisprudence contemplates that there may be circumstances in which the requisite connection is not established and the evidence was outside its “obtained in a manner” requirement. In my view, it is an unhelpful label that creates and supports an improper path of reasoning, serving to divide a holistic analysis into two parts. The trial decision in this case demonstrates the dangers that accompany the “fresh start” doctrine. In finding that there was a “fresh start” such that the Charter breaches were “cured”, the trial judge characterized the police conduct following the arrest as a second transaction, unrelated to the prior events (paras. 207‑11). This allowed him to ignore the unlawful conduct that preceded the arrests while relying only on the Charter-compliant conduct following the arrests to justify a lack of connection between the Charter violations and the statements.

[201]                     Respectfully, the approach my colleague has taken to the “fresh start” doctrine leads to a replication of the trial judge’s error. Though he rejects the trial judge’s conclusion that police can “cure” an earlier Charter breach with Charter-compliant conduct (para. 106, citing ABQB reasons, at paras. 191, 206, 215, 239 and 253), he similarly enumerates police conduct that would allow just that; indicators that the police have rectified their breaches with new, Charter-compliant conduct (factors enumerated at para. 103). There is no “focussed and powerful antidote” that can erase conduct violating the Charter (para. 101, citing Simon, at para. 70); this conduct must always form part of the “obtained in a manner” analysis.

[202]                     By shifting the focus to the eventual Charter-compliant conduct, the “fresh start” doctrine distracts from the remedial nature of s. 24(2) and allows police to insulate their conduct from review, regardless of the severity of that conduct. This approach clashes with the principle under the Grant inquiry that Charter-compliant conduct by some police officers does not negate or reduce the severity of the Charter-infringing conduct of other police officers (R. v. Reilly, 2020 BCCA 369, 397 C.C.C. (3d) 219, at paras. 93-102, aff’d 2021 SCC 38; see also CCLA Factum, at para. 20).

[203]                     After reviewing the entire course of events, I conclude that the evidence was “obtained in a manner” that infringed the appellants’ Charter rights. Because the trial judge erred in (1) concluding that there were reasonable grounds to arrest the appellants and in (2) relying on the concept of a “fresh start” to sever the connection between the initial Charter breaches and subsequent statements provided, his conclusion that the evidence was not “obtained in a manner” within the meaning of s. 24(2) of the Charter is not owed deference. Here, there is a strong temporal, contextual, and causal connection between the breaches of the appellants’ Charter rights and the collection of their statements. The appellants were under the continuous control and supervision of the police from the time of their unlawful detention and transportation from the scene, to the time Det. Vermette unlawfully directed their arrests, to the time they ultimately admitted their involvement some 12 hours later. The police facilitating a second consultation with counsel for Mr. Lambert and advising him that they are “start[ing] everything all over again” does nothing to relinquish the firm grasp they continued to hold on him (A.R., vol. II, at p. 30). Although a causal connection is not required, the fact that the police would not have obtained the evidence but for the detention, transport, and arrests that were conducted in a manner that violated their Charter rights supports the conclusion that the Charter breaches and the evidence the appellants provided in their statements were “inextricably linked” (R. v. Black, 1989 CanLII 75 (SCC), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 138, at p. 163).

C.            Admission of the Evidence Would Bring the Administration of Justice Into Disrepute

[204]                     The final question to be addressed is whether, having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of that evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. I have no doubt that it would.

[205]                     Given my conclusion that the trial judge erred in his analysis on whether there were reasonable grounds for arrest, his alternative analysis under s. 24(2) is not owed deference (R. v. Le, 2019 SCC 34, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 692, at para. 138; R. v. Paterson, 2017 SCC 15, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 202, at para. 42; Grant, at para. 129). Even if this were not the case, there are legal errors in the trial judge’s alternative analysis, which I discuss below, that would justify revisiting his conclusions. Further, the judge’s finding that the arrests “cured” the previous Charter breaches undermined his ability to appreciate the impact of those breaches on the appellants. I will therefore conduct my own analysis of the Grant factors.

(1)         Seriousness of the Charter-Infringing State Conduct

[206]                     The Charter-infringing state conduct for which the appellants seek a remedy includes:

(i)     their unlawful detention, transport, and search pursuant to a non-existent police power in non-existent legislation, resulting in breaches of ss. 7, 8, 9, 10(a) and 10(b);

(ii)  Cst. Taylor’s failure to hold off on questioning Mr. Lambert, violating his rights under ss. 7 and 10(b); and

(iii) their arrest for murder absent reasonable grounds, resulting in further arbitrary detention contrary to s. 9.

[207]                     The police conduct in this case can only be described as a string of extremely serious violations of well-established Charter principles. In no circumstances were the officers acting in areas of urgency or legal uncertainty. Each of the principles that were breached in this case have been foundational legal requirements since the early years of the Charter. That these Charter requirements took a back seat to investigative convenience and expediency is unacceptable and brings the administration of justice into disrepute. The trial judge’s conclusion that the breaches were not serious, and even the product of “good faith” errors, is untenable when applying the correct legal principles to the facts as he found them.

[208]                     The absence of bad faith conduct in breaching Charter rights does not mean that the breaches are not “severe” or at the serious end of the spectrum in the analysis under s. 24(2). Circumstances where police are found to have deliberately breached the Charter are exceedingly rare. However, we expect a great deal more of police than simply refraining from purposely abusing their powers. As state actors who are empowered with extraordinary authority to detain, interrogate, and use force against members of the public in the execution of their duties, it is imperative that police conduct remains scrupulously in line with the boundaries circumscribed by constitutional standards. For this reason, a failure to abide by established principles governing police conduct is considered extremely serious conduct that would tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute (R. v. Kokesch, 1990 CanLII 55 (SCC), [1990] 3 S.C.R. 3, at pp. 32-33; R. v. Genest, 1989 CanLII 109 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 59, at p. 87). Indeed, conduct that is “reckless”, “negligent”, or “ignorant” should support exclusion of the evidence (Grant, at paras. 74-75). Conduct does not need to be deliberate, motivated by an ulterior purpose, or involve systemic or institutional abuse in order to favour a remedy (Grant, at para. 75; R. v. Harrison, 2009 SCC 34, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 494, at paras. 24-25; Paterson, at para. 47; Le, at para. 143).

[209]                     The concept of “good faith” has a particular legal meaning in the context of the s. 24(2) analysis. For conduct to be described as “good faith”, the police must have conducted themselves in a manner consistent with what they “subjectively, reasonably, and non-negligently believe[d] to be the law” (Le, at para. 147, quoting R. v. Washington, 2007 BCCA 540, 248 B.C.A.C. 65, at para. 78 (emphasis added); see also Paterson, at para. 44). The conduct cannot be considered “good faith” if it was based on an unreasonable error or ignorance as to the scope of police authority (R. v. Buhay, 2003 SCC 30, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 631, at para. 59; Tim, at para. 85). Failing to act in bad faith — for example, by knowingly or deliberately breaching the accused’s Charter rights — does not mean that there was good faith police conduct, unless the conduct was also reasonable and showed a genuine attempt to respect and even promote the rights guaranteed under the Charter (Le, at para. 147).

[210]                     The trial judge erred in failing to apply these principles to the actions of the officers in this case in the alternative analysis he conducted under s. 24(2).

[211]                     The trial judge found that in directing the appellants’ arrests under the Medical Examiners Act, Sgt. Lines “was looking for a way to maintain control over Mr. Beaver and Mr. Lambert, but was not sure exactly how to do it” (para. 230). He characterized this conduct as “reckless”, but not “deliberate”, “severe”, or indicative of a “blatant disregard” for the appellants’ Charter rights (para. 230). While the judge correctly found that this conduct could not be characterized as good faith and favoured exclusion, I cannot accept his conclusion that the conduct was not severe and did not show a disregard for the appellants’ Charter rights. Detaining the appellants under a non-existent police power simply because the officer was searching for a way to maintain control over them does exactly that. The import of his finding was that the officer was operating with an end goal other than ensuring that the necessary legal standards governing police conduct were met. This shows a disregard for the bounds of police authority to limit individual liberty through arrest and detention. It is decidedly very serious conduct.

[212]                     As for Cst. Taylor’s decision to start questioning Mr. Lambert in the car before having provided him with an opportunity to speak to counsel, the judge found that the questioning was not serious or a blatant disregard for Mr. Lambert’s Charter rights. He noted that it was not an interrogation or a deliberate attempt to elicit incriminating information; Cst. Taylor simply asked what had happened. He described the seriousness of this conduct in the following terms (at para. 234):

This Court cannot find Cst. Taylor’s question completely blameless. Although innocent on its face, and likely intended not to illicit incriminating information, Cst. Taylor took the risk that Mr. Lambert would provide incriminating evidence. In posing this question, therefore, he was negligent. But does this negligent behaviour move the breach to the more serious side of the breach spectrum? In Grant, McLachlin CJC and Charron J said, “‘[g]ood faith’ on the part of the police will also reduce the need for the court to disassociate itself from the police conduct”: Grant at para 75. This Court finds that Cst. Taylor was posing the question in good faith. He was not attempting to elicit evidence from Mr. Lambert. Rather, he was simply posing a question that might further the investigation as to how Mr. Bowers died. In so doing, he was negligent, but not grossly so. His behaviour would fall more to the less serious side of the spectrum.

[213]                     Respectfully, it is not possible to conclude that the failure to hold off on questioning Mr. Lambert was a “good faith” or non-serious error. In citing para. 75 of Grant for authority that good faith on the part of police will reduce the need to dissociate from police conduct, the judge unfortunately overlooked the very next sentence of that paragraph, which affirms that “negligence or wilful blindness cannot be equated with good faith”. The judge made the express finding, which is well grounded in the facts, that Cst. Taylor’s failure to hold off questioning demonstrated negligence in meeting the conduct required of police officers.

[214]                     The legal implication of the trial judge’s factual findings is that the s. 10(b) breach during the transportation of Mr. Lambert was serious and favoured exclusion of the evidence. Section 10(b) of the Charter is concerned with self-incrimination and these concerns are present at the outset of detention (R. v. Suberu, 2009 SCC 33, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 460, at para. 2). The duty to hold off has long been a crucial aspect of the implementational duties required of police; once a detainee asserts their right to counsel, the police cannot compel them to partake in a process which could adversely affect the conduct of an eventual trial until that right has been exercised (R. v. Prosper, 1994 CanLII 65 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 236, at p. 269, citing R. v. Ross, 1989 CanLII 134 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 3, at p. 12).

[215]                     There was no uncertainty in the law, nor was there any sense of urgency that might have required the police to begin questioning Mr. Lambert before they could facilitate a call with counsel. The fact that the questioning was done in a casual manner rather than an interrogation-style in no way diminishes the seriousness of this conduct, which by the trial judge’s finding was designed to “further the investigation as to how Mr. Bowers died”. The question asked was designed to get a response about what happened. Whether the officer said he did not expect to receive incriminating evidence does not negate the seriousness of failing to ensure that Mr. Lambert obtained the legal advice he requested and had a right to receive before he was subject to police questioning. Mr. Lambert could have made incriminating statements in the police cruiser, and the seriousness of the police’s Charter-infringing conduct is not mitigated by the fact that he did not.

[216]                     Finally, the judge concluded that if he was wrong in finding there were reasonable grounds to arrest the appellants, Det. Vermette’s conduct would not be serious. He relied on the fact that Det. Vermette was acting in a “fluid situation”, did not “have the luxury of time and thorough consideration”, and could not be expected to undertake a complete analysis of the bases supporting his grounds like a court could do in hindsight (paras. 232 and 240). I disagree in principle with these conclusions.

[217]                     The decision to arrest the appellants constituted a serious violation of their Charter rights. A subjective belief in reasonable grounds does not excuse the decision to arrest in order to justify continued detention in the absence of objective reasonable grounds. Undertaking a thorough analysis of whether the information known to officers at the time was enough to support a credibly based probability that the appellants had killed Mr. Bowers was thus required.

[218]                     Contrary to the trial judge’s conclusion, the officers were not acting in the type of “fluid situation” that might support a finding that there was insufficient time to undertake a complete analysis of the bases supporting, and pointing away from, the grounds for arrest. There was no need to act quickly to preserve officer safety, take control of a dynamic situation, or prevent the destruction of evidence. An investigation is always “fluid” in the sense that officers continuously gather information and make decisions on the basis of that information. This does not licence them to breach the Charter, nor does it make any breaches less serious or excusable. Fluidity is not a reason to fail to approach the applicable legal standard with rigour. There is no reason that the police did not have the luxury of time and consideration before making a determination about whether there were reasonable grounds to arrest the appellants.

[219]                     While the officer was right to be concerned with protecting the appellants’ Charter rights when he was presented with the circumstances of their unlawful detention, there was an equally viable alternative that would better achieve that objective in this case: releasing the appellants from custody and arresting them once there were reasonable grounds to do so. No attempts were made to inquire into the reasons why the appellants were not arrested and were instead detained under a statute that Det. Vermette knew did not exist and did not grant the police any detention powers. Any perceived urgency by the officers at this time was of their own making. It is not a basis for lowering the standards we expect them to uphold under the Charter.

[220]                     While I find it unnecessary to determine whether it impacted the voluntariness of the statements, the post-arrest conduct of the police also indicates a lack of attention to ensuring the appellants understood the seriousness of the circumstances they faced. At best, informing the appellants that they were arrested simply because they were witnesses and the police needed to determine what happened showed a lack of care towards ensuring the appellants understood the extent of the jeopardy that accompanies being arrested for murder.

[221]                     In sum, the state conduct in this case involved decisions by three separate officers to undertake actions in violation of well-established Charter standards, placing investigative expediency above the rights of the appellants in the face of no urgency and no legal uncertainty. Not only were these breaches serious on their own, but the pattern of disregard shown by these officers over the course of the investigation further supports the conclusion that admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute (Grant, at para. 75). This factor weighs heavily in favour of exclusion.

(2)         Impact on the Appellants’ Charter-Protected Interests

[222]                     Because of the Charter breaches, the appellants were deprived of their liberty for several hours without a lawful basis and without being informed of the reason, preventing them from being able to make an informed decision about whether to cooperate with police. During this time, the police kept the appellants in custody, searched them, and continued their investigation to the point where they purportedly obtained sufficient grounds to arrest them for murder. They then continued to detain and interrogate them on the basis of those purported grounds until they admitted their involvement in Mr. Bowers’ death. There is no doubt that the intrusion on their Charter-protected interests was serious.

[223]                     In the alternative analysis the trial judge conducted under s. 24(2), he failed to consider the impact of the appellants’ inability to receive legal advice based on an informed understanding of their jeopardy during their unlawful detention and transport — a time at which they were highly vulnerable to the exercise of state power. He instead focused on his findings that the appellants knew they had staged the scene of the death, from which he surmised that they knew the reasons for their detention. He also gave significant weight to his findings that the appellants would have spoken to the police no matter what because they were intent on providing their exculpatory narrative. For these reasons, he concluded that the breaches “had little effect” on the appellants (para. 247).

[224]                     I have significant concerns with these aspects of the trial judge’s analysis. It does not follow from knowledge that the police are investigating a death that the appellants should have understood the extent of their legal jeopardy. Even the officers at the scene testified that they did not understand the basis for the appellants’ detention. In the case of Mr. Beaver, the officer laughed while detaining him and providing his caution, signaling that she was not taking the situation seriously and that he need not either.

[225]                     It is speculative to conclude that the appellants would have chosen to speak to police and provide the exculpatory narrative had they been properly notified of the circumstances of their jeopardy and given the right to speak to counsel on the basis of that information. It could equally have been the case that the appellants gave their exculpatory narrative because they did not appreciate the seriousness of the jeopardy they faced or the implications of providing that information, or felt they had to continue with the narrative they had committed themselves to without being properly informed (see, e.g., Plaha, at paras. 59-61; R. v. Noel, 2019 ONCA 860, at para. 27 (CanLII)).

[226]                     The trial judge also commented on the impact of Cst. Taylor’s breach of the duty to hold off on Mr. Lambert, determining that he “provided his explanation to Cst. Taylor spontaneously following Cst. Taylor’s Charter breach” and would have done so in any event because he wanted to profess his innocence (para. 238). It is unclear what was spontaneous about this explanation given that it was provided in direct response to Cst. Taylor’s questioning. The basis on which the judge concluded that Mr. Lambert would have provided his explanation to Cst. Taylor without prompting is also unclear. Again, the fact that the explanation provided was exculpatory does not lessen the impact of his uninformed choice to speak to police. 

[227]                     The Crown argues that the impact of the unlawful arrests is lessened by the fact that the police found out shortly after the arrests, at about 12:35 p.m., that Mr. Bowers had sent incriminating messages on his computer to a friend on the evening of October 8, 2016. The messages stated that Mr. Bowers was “taking brian and jim down” because “they fucked [him]” (R.R., at p. 45). Another message was sent some three hours later, stating: “I just destroyed brian and jim now I can get some worthy roommates any suggestions” (p. 45). In the Crown’s submission, these messages further confirmed the animus between the deceased and the appellants and would have resolved any doubt about the grounds for the arrests shortly after they were originally carried out.

[228]                     I am doubtful that this information, which again corroborated an uncontroversial point and which pointed to the deceased — not the appellants — as the aggressor, would have made up the difference needed to reach the reasonable grounds threshold. Further, the additional information from the PIMS report establishes Mr. Bowers as having assaulted Mr. Lambert, and the report makes no mention at all of Mr. Beaver. In any event, even if this information were sufficient to provide objectively reasonable grounds, it would not significantly lessen the cumulative impact of the breaches on the appellants’ Charter-protected interests that led to that point.

[229]                     The comments by police after the appellants’ arrests telling them that they were mere witnesses and the arrests were merely procedural further exacerbated the impact of the breaches on the appellants by downplaying the extent of their jeopardy. For Mr. Beaver, Det. Hossack’s reassurance that his arrest changed nothing about his circumstances — which was clearly false — heightened the impact on his Charter-protected interests.

[230]                     This factor also weighs in favour of exclusion.

(3)         Society’s Interest in the Adjudication of the Case on Its Merits

[231]                     Society’s interests in the adjudication of the case on its merits favours admission of the evidence, but not overwhelmingly so. It is not clear that the Crown’s case would be “gutted” if the statements were excluded (Grant, at para. 83). And while the offence is undoubtedly serious, this factor “cut[s] both ways” as the public has a heightened interest in ensuring the justice system is above reproach when the penal stakes for the accused are high (Grant, at para. 84). On this point, Iacobucci J.’s comments in R. v. Burlingham, 1995 CanLII 88 (SCC), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 206, at para. 50, are apposite:

. . . I underscore that we should never lose sight of the fact that even a person accused of the most heinous crimes, and no matter the likelihood that he or she actually committed those crimes, is entitled to the full protection of the Charter. Short-cutting or short-circuiting those rights affects not only the accused, but also the entire reputation of the criminal justice system. It must be emphasized that the goals of preserving the integrity of the criminal justice system as well as promoting the decency of investigatory techniques are of fundamental importance in applying s. 24(2).

(4)         Balancing

[232]                     On balance, I conclude that admission of the evidence in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute and therefore the evidence must be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter. The circumstances of the appellants’ detention and questioning led to multiple officers breaching multiple Charter rights. The police conduct was extremely serious, violating foundational Charter principles that officers have been bound for decades to follow during the course of an investigation. There were no circumstances of uncertainty in the law or urgency in handling a dynamic situation that might explain these basic errors, which fundamentally undermined the appellants’ Charter-protected interests. Given the strength of the first two Grant factors, society’s interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits is insufficient to tip the balance in favour of admission (Le, at para. 142; Paterson, at para. 56).

IV.         Conclusion

[233]                     I would therefore allow the appeals, exclude all the evidence obtained in a manner that infringed the appellants’ Charter rights, set aside the appellants’ convictions, and order new trials. While the appellants sought an order substituting acquittals, the trial judge’s reasons indicated that the Crown may have evidence to make a case even having excluded this evidence (see ABQB reasons, at paras. 251-52), and there is insufficient information in the record available at this Court to determine otherwise.

                    Appeals dismissed, Karakatsanis, Côté, Brown and Martin JJ. dissenting.
