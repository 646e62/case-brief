Edmonton Between: His Majesty the King Respondent - and - Patrick Scarlett Applicant _______________________________________________________
Reasons for Decision of The Honourable Justice Frans Slatter _______________________________________________________
Application for Permission to Appeal _______________________________________________________
Reasons for Decision of The Honourable Justice Frans Slatter _______________________________________________________ 

[1] The applicant was convicted in traffic court of speeding and parking on a snow route.
It appears he was convicted after he failed to appear at his trial because he did not receive adequate notice of the charges.
He appealed to the Court of King’s Bench, and the prosecutor consented to setting aside the convictions and returning the matter for retrial. 

[2] The applicant applied for leave to appeal the King’s Bench decision to the Court of Appeal on the basis that the charges against him should have been quashed, not sent back for retrial.
As required by the Rules of Court, the applicant gave an address for service in South Edmonton. 

[3] On November 7, 2022 the applicant filed his memorandum of argument, using the same address for service.
On November 8, 2022 the Deputy Registrar set this matter for hearing on March 8, 2023.
A reminder was sent on February 22, 2023.
That letter was sent to the applicant’s address for service.
The process server who attempted to serve the Crown’s memorandum was apparently advised that the applicant has been in Jamaica since December 30, 2022, with a return date of March 12, 2023.
Yesterday the applicant telephoned the Registry and advised he will be back in the Country “within 1-2 weeks” at which time he will contact the Court regarding this matter. 

[4] When the applicant did not appear this morning, the Crown generously agreed to adjourn the matter.
That, however, is not an option because the matter is set for trial in the Provincial Court on March 20, 2023.
A further adjournment, and further delay, is not justified or appropriate. 

[5] It is unfortunate that the applicant apparently did not realize that the application was set for this morning.
However, all litigants are required to give an address for service, and keep it up to date.
It is not acceptable for an applicant to leave the country for an extended period of time without monitoring his court proceedings, having somebody check his mail, and having somebody forward time sensitive mail to him. 

[6] In many cases like this, the Court would grant an adjournment, but as mentioned that would jeopardize the Provincial Court trial date.
When a party fails to appear, the Court has the option of proceeding in his absence based on the written materials: R. 14.51.
In this case both parties filed extensive written arguments, and it is possible to fairly adjudicate the issues without oral argument. 

[7] The first impediment to the application is that the applicant consented to the order he wants to appeal.
Appeals of consent orders are rarely allowed.
As the Crown points out, the applicant obtained the relief he requested (setting aside his convictions) and he cannot fairly complain. 

[8] The second impediment is that the applicant requires an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal.
He has shown no basis on which an extension could be granted. 

[9] The third impediment is that the applicant has not shown any reason in law why the charges against him should be quashed.
The applicant argues that there were procedural irregularities leading up to his first conviction, but those have now been remedied by the consent order which grants him a new trial.
He also argues that he suffered “trials and tribulations”, including changes of the presiding judge, some delay in being heard, and having to move between different courtrooms in the Court of King’s Bench.
That is not a sufficient basis to quash the charges. 

[10] In summary, the applicant has not identified any basis for granting him leave to appeal, and the application is dismissed.
The applicant has his remedy, which is to defend the charges against him in the Provincial Court.
Written submissions filed November 7, 2022 and February 16, 2023 and oral appearance March 8, 2023.
