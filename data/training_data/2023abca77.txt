Henderson Convicted on the 19th day of May, 2021 (2021 ABQB 386, Docket: 160893426Q1) _______________________________________________________ Memorandum of Judgment Delivered from the Bench _______________________________________________________ Slatter J.A. (for the Court): 
[1] The appellant appeals his convictions for first degree murder, aggravated assault, and discharging a firearm with intent to prevent arrest: R. v Admasu, 2021 ABQB 386. 
[2] Daniel Holly was killed and his common law Spouse
[1] was injured as they left their apartment building when they were shot by two assailants who were waiting in the parking lot. Within a few minutes the police identified a suspect van and commenced a police chase during which shots were fired from the van at the police. The van was found a short time later. A police dog tracked the appellant from the van to a nearby school, where a black bag was found containing two handguns. The appellant’s DNA was on the handguns, and his hands tested positive for gun powder residue. The guns were confirmed to be those involved in the murder of Mr. Holly and in the shots fired during the police pursuit. The whole event from the shooting to apprehension lasted about 23 minutes. 
[3] The central issue at trial was identification. The trial judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was one of the shooters. 
[4] One issue arose from a photo lineup identification completed by the Spouse while she was waiting for surgery at the hospital. In the lineup, which was done within 16 hours of the events and which was videotaped and audiotaped, the Spouse can be seen making a tentative identification of the appellant. At trial, however, the Spouse claimed not to remember the lineup, said that she was drugged, and she would not confirm the identification she had made: reasons at para. 114. The trial judge did not believe her: reasons at para. 125. 
[5] Since the Spouse would not adopt the photo lineup, the trial judge concluded that it could only be admitted under the principled exception to the hearsay rule: reasons at para. 139. He concluded that the threshold requirement of “reasonable necessity” was met: reasons at para. 145. The evidence had both procedural reliability (reasons at para. 157) and substantive reliability (reasons at paras 171-72). The photo lineup had some, although not conclusive probative value on the issue of identity: reasons at para. 205. Its probative value exceeded its prejudicial effect and the evidence should be admitted: reasons at paras 139, 174. The appellant argues admission of this evidence was a reviewable error, but the trial judge correctly stated the law, and his findings of fact and inferences disclose no palpable and overriding error. 
[6] The appellant argues that the procedure followed was unfair. It appears, however, that experienced defence counsel likely made no objection to the procedure for tactical reasons. Necessity was obvious, and the defence decided to focus on the reliability of the statement. 
[7] The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in his assessment and reliance on the circumstantial evidence, because there were other reasonable inferences that could have been drawn. This argument is a challenge to the fact findings of the trial judge, which are entitled to deference on appeal. The circumstantial evidence when taken collectively overwhelmingly supported the trial judge’s findings that the appellant was one of the shooters, and that this shooting was planned and deliberate. There is no risk of a miscarriage of justice on this record. 
[8] In conclusion, the appellant has not shown any reviewable error, and the appeal is dismissed. Appeal heard on March 02, 2023 Memorandum filed at Edmonton, Alberta this 6th day of March, 2023 Slatter J.A. Appearances: R.A. Fata for the Respondent A.L. Serink for the Appellant
