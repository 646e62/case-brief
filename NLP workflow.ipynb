      "made to him by the Crown in response to his constitutional right to make full\n",

      "[8]    According to Mr. S.D.B., the offending portions of the reasons of the trial judge are found at paras.\n",
      "47 and 48 of the judgment.  They read as follows:\n",
      "[47]      S.D.B.\n",
      "knew, at the time that he gave his evidence, that the police had a forensic\n",
      "report and other objective evidence placing him and the vehicle at the location\n",
      "where this alleged assault took place, that his semen (as a result of DNA\n",
      "testing and matching) that was recovered from J.G.’s vagina and anus and the\n",
      "pictures depicting the injuries to her face, neck and other areas of her body\n",
      "existed and would need to be explained. He testified that he reviewed this\n",
      "evidence, the preliminary hearing transcript and witness statements prior to\n",
      "testifying at the trial.\n",
      "[48]      His evidence respecting the\n",
      "three occasions of consensual intercourse served his need to explain the\n",
      "presence of his semen on and in J.G.’s body. His admission that he drove\n",
      "through the barb wire fence and did park at the alleged scene, the location of\n",
      "two further episodes of consensual sex, served to address that objective\n",
      "evidence. His testimony that an argument ensued between the second and third\n",
      "episodes causing him to strike her with the back of his hand under her chin was\n",
      "an admission of an assault. That evidence, however, comes nowhere close to\n",
      "explaining the nature and extent of her physical injuries. To this he added the\n",
      "explanation of her inexplicable wandering (apparently without shoes), into\n",
      "thick bush and his evidence that she fell when doing so. This, he testified,\n",
      "might account for any injuries she might have had. His evidence on these\n",
      "matters notwithstanding, he testified in cross-examination, on a number of\n",
      "occasions, that he saw no apparent physical injuries or marks on her face even\n",
      "up to the point when they were driving to the Cote gas bar. These statements\n",
      "lack all credibility when one considers J.G.’s appearance in the photographs in\n",

      "Trial Judge Improperly Admitted Reply Evidence\n",
      "[27]  Prior to closing its case, the Crown\n",
      "applied to tender J.G.’s panties as rebuttal evidence.  Its purpose in doing so\n",
      "was to rebut an assertion by the accused in his testimony that the complainant\n",
      "was not wearing panties on the occasion of the alleged sexual assault.  The\n",
      "alleged assault was said by the complainant to have occurred in the countryside,\n",

      "on three occasions that evening, beginning with sexual intercourse at his\n",
      "nephew’s place of residence, and followed by two additional acts of intercourse\n",
      "in the countryside.  In so testifying, he said she was not wearing panties on\n",
      "the first of the occasions in the countryside, which suggested by implication\n",
      "that her panties had been left behind at his nephew’s place of residence\n",
      "following the act of intercourse that had occurred there.\n",
      "[28]  In fact, the police had taken possession of her panties, along with the rest of her clothing, while\n",
      "she was in the hospital following the events of the evening.  This was not\n",
      "disputed.  But when the Crown sought to tender her panties in rebuttal, defence\n",
      "counsel objected.  He took the position the Crown could have tendered the\n",
      "panties as part of its case, and should have done so (if it intended to make\n",
      "something of the panties), for it could reasonably have anticipated that the\n",
      "panties formed an important part of its case.\n",
      "[29]  Before ruling on the Crown’s request to tender the panties as rebuttal evidence, the trial judge\n",
      "received the agreement of counsel that the issue was simply whether J.G. was\n",
      "wearing panties or not.  The trial judge permitted the panties to be tendered\n",
      "as rebuttal evidence since credibility was the primary issue and Mr. S.D.B. and\n",

      "[36]  The trial judge found Mr. S.D.B. to be a\n",

      "him, as such, to an indeterminate period of imprisonment pursuant to s. 753(4).\n",

      "[38]  While the judge was not satisfied of\n",
      "this, the psychologist designated by the court to perform the assessment contemplated\n",
      "by s. 752.1 took something of a different view of the matter. The psychologist\n",
      "was Dr. Stephen Wormith Ph.D., a professor on the Faculty of Psychology,\n",
      "University of Saskatchewan. As the trial judge observed, Dr. Wormith has a most\n",
      "impressive set of academic and clinical credentials, has conducted many such\n",
      "assessments, and is familiar with the Federal and Provincial correctional\n",
      "systems, including the treatment and other corrections programs available to\n",
      "inmates to assist in their rehabilitation. \n",
      "[39]  It was Dr. Wormith who raised the idea\n",
      "that Mr. S.D.B. might be found to be a long-term offender and sentenced as\n",
      "such. He did so based on his assessment of the prospects of eventually reducing\n",
      "Mr. S.D.B.’s risk of re-offence to an acceptable level in the community through\n",
      "the imposition of a suitable long-term offender sentence. \n",
      "[40]  In his report to the court upon\n",
      "completion of his assessment, Dr. Wormith reported that Mr. S.D.B., who\n",
      "was then 43 years of age, was of Saulteaux heritage and had grown up on the\n",
      "Cote Reserve, near the communities of Kamsack and B[…]. The latter was named\n",
      "after Mr. S.D.B.’s deceased father, who had a reputation as a hard-working\n",
      "farmer and logger, and as a distinguished aboriginal leader. Among other\n",
      "things, his father had been a First Nations Chief and was the first person ever\n",
      "elected to the […]. \n",
      "[41]  Mr. S.D.B., who is one of seven children\n",
      "(four boys and three girls), spent most of his formative years with his father,\n",
      "following upon the separation of his parents. Throughout his youth he worked\n",
      "alongside his father, of whom he was particularly proud (not so much as a\n",
      "parent as otherwise), and from whom he learned much about hard work and\n",
      "machines and equipment.  But he had not gained much else in the way of\n",
      "education, having dropped out of school in the sixth grade. Later, however, he\n",
      "managed to upgrade his formal education, achieving the equivalent of a grade\n",
      "12. Dr. Wormith regarded this as a noteworthy accomplishment.  \n",
      "[42]  Throughout his youth, Mr. S.D.B. and his\n",
      "siblings were exposed to a lifestyle lacking in parental supervision and rife\n",
      "with excessive alcohol consumption and domestic violence. Dr. Wormith said this\n",
      "had taken its toll on the family. Mr. S.D.B. had taken to drinking excessively,\n",
      "his three brothers had died at a relatively young age (one in an\n",
      "alcohol-related accident), and one of his sisters had fallen prey to alcohol,\n",
      "though in time she overcame this, earned a degree in social work, and went on\n",
      "to a productive career in that field.    \n",
      "[43]  In conducting his assessment of Mr.\n",
      "S.D.B., Dr. Wormith found him to be a cooperative and comparatively\n",
      "intelligent, educated, articulate, and agreeable man, possessed of considerable\n",
      "insight, though he tended to minimize some of his past criminal conduct. Dr.\n",
      "Wormith also found him to be mechanically skilled and accustomed to hard work,\n",
      "though given to impulsive and sometimes violent behavior, especially when\n",
      "drinking. \n",
      "[44]  In the opinion of Dr. Wormith, Mr.\n",
      "S.D.B. had a serious substance abuse problem and was probably alcohol\n",
      "dependent, if not drug dependent as well. In addition, he had an anti-social\n",
      "personality disorder. This was reflected in his criminal record, which included\n",
      "numerous property offences, even more numerous drinking and driving offences, a\n",
      "number of offences entailing the breach of court orders, and several assaults.\n",
      "Most of the assaults, particularly those of note, were associated with drinking\n",
      "and domestic violence. Two of them, including the predicate offence,\n",
      "constituted sexual assaults.  \n",
      "[45]  The nature and extent of Mr. S.D.B.’s\n",
      "criminal record, together with his anti-social personality disorder and the\n",
      "likelihood he was alcohol dependent, led Dr. Wormith to assess him as\n",
      "constituting a high risk to reoffend, both generally and, to a lesser extent,\n",
      "specifically. Thus he presented a high risk of again driving while impaired and\n",
      "prohibited from doing so for instance, and a high risk of again resorting to\n",
      "violence, especially domestic violence. \n",
      "[46]  Having thus assessed the risk and the\n",
      "basis for it, Dr. Wormith went on to assess the prospects of reducing it to a\n",
      "manageable level over time and by resort to the treatment and other corrections\n",
      "programs available in prison and beyond. He assessed the prospects as being\n",
      "sufficiently promising to suggest there was a reasonable possibility of\n",
      "eventual control of the risk in the community by means of intensive treatment\n",
      "and corrections programming in prison, followed by a suitable period of\n",
      "supervision in the community under such conditions as would provide for\n",
      "appropriate follow-up and control.\n",
      "[47]  The trial judge disagreed. He agreed\n",
      "with Dr. Wormith that Mr. S.D.B. was capable of participating in and potentially\n",
      "benefiting from such intensive treatment and corrections programs, but he\n",
      "disagreed with Dr. Wormith’s assessment that Mr. S.D.B. was motivated\n",
      "to do so. \n",
      "[48]  As the judge saw it, Mr. S.D.B.’s past\n",
      "performance in these respects belied the notion he was motivated to take\n",
      "advantage of the intensive treatment and rehabilitation programs offered in\n",
      "prison or, for that matter, the follow-up services available in the community.\n",
      "The man had participated in some such programs in the past, the judge observed,\n",
      "but had failed to take them seriously on occasion and had failed, in any event,\n",
      "to profit from them. Nor had he shown any real interest over the years in the\n",
      "programs and support services available to troubled residents of the Cote\n",
      "Reserve and other nearby Reserves, the judge noted, adding that this served to\n",
      "cast doubt upon the man’s sincerity in saying he would like to take\n",
      "advantage in time of the resources available in these First Nations\n",
      "communities. \n",
      "[49]  So, while agreeing that Mr. S.D.B. was\n",
      "capable of participating in and potentially profiting from intensive treatment\n",
      "and corrections programs while in prison, the judge disagreed with Dr.\n",
      "Wormith’s assessment that the man was motivated to do so, adding that the man’s\n",
      "sincerity in relation to his professed willingness to participate in follow-up\n",
      "programs in the community was doubtful.  Hence the judge rejected Dr. Wormith’s\n",
      "positive assessment of the prospects of the eventual control of the risk of\n",
      "re-offence in the community by means of the imposition of a suitable long-term\n",
      "offender sentence. \n",
      "[50]  In the light of all of this, and\n",
      "satisfied Mr. S.D.B. qualified as a dangerous offender, the trial judge discarded\n",
      "the idea that Mr. S.D.B. be sentenced as a long-term offender and, instead,\n",
      "sentenced him as a dangerous offender to an indeterminate period of\n",
      "imprisonment.\n",
      "[51]  To be sure, this is but a brief account\n",
      "of the imposition of the sentence and what lay beneath, but it will serve to\n",
      "set the context for what follows, including the bases for Mr. S.D.B.’s appeal.[1]    \n",
      "2.       The Bases for the Appeal\n",
      " \n",
      "[52]  The appeal is founded on ss. 759(1) and\n",
      "(3) of the Criminal Code. As such it is subject to the standard\n",
      "of appellate review laid down in R. v. Currie, 1997 CanLII 347 (SCC), [1997] 2 S.C.R.\n",
      "260, meaning the trial judge’s findings merit some deference on appeal, for\n",
      "credibility should be assessed and findings of fact made by the trier of fact\n",
      "who has the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses. \n",
      "[53]  That said, the appeal was advanced on\n",
      "the grounds the trial judge erred in three distinct but related respects:  \n",
      "(1)     He improperly\n",
      "discounted Dr. Wormith’s positive assessment of the prospects of eventually\n",
      "reducing Mr. S.D.B.’s risk of re-offence to an acceptable level in the\n",
      "community by means of the imposition of a suitable long-term offender sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2)     He failed to\n",
      "fully appreciate or give adequate expression to the notion that the prospect of\n",
      "reducing the risk of re-offence to an acceptable level by means of the\n",
      "imposition of a suitable long-term offender sentence is a function of both\n",
      "a fixed term of imprisonment of appropriate duration and quality and an\n",
      "appropriate period of long-term supervision in the community under suitable\n",
      "conditions. \n",
      "(3)     He imposed an\n",
      "unreasonable sentence in the circumstances.\n",
      "[54]  In consequence, Mr. S.D.B. asked to\n",
      "have the sentence set aside and replaced with a long-term offender sentence.\n",
      "[55]  In general, the errors the trial judge\n",
      "is said to have made fall to be addressed in the context of the underlay of\n",
      "principle bearing upon the proper application of the dangerous offender and\n",
      "long-term offender provisions of the Criminal Code, which is to say the\n",
      "provisions of s. 753 (dangerous offenders) and s. 753.1 (long-term offenders).\n",

      "[56]  The provisions of ss. 753 and 753.1,\n",
      "when working in tandem, are concerned to segregate the truly dangerous offender\n",
      "from other offenders whose risk of re-offence, while exceptional in nature and\n",
      "severity, appears nonetheless to be open to eventual control in the community\n",
      "through the imposition of a long-term offender sentence. This concern is born\n",
      "of the manifestly repressive nature of the sentence reserved for dangerous\n",
      "offenders, namely a sentence of imprisonment for an indeterminate period. This\n",
      "is an extraordinary sentence, inasmuch as it amounts to a form of indefinite\n",
      "preventive detention, and must therefore find justification in the\n",
      "extraordinary. Hence, it has been held that such a sentence “finds its\n",
      "justification in the protection of the public when the risk of re-offence and\n",
      "resulting harm to others is so acute and potentially unmanageable as to warrant\n",
      "such detention.” R. v. Lemaigre, 2004 SKCA 125, 189 C.C.C. (3d)\n",
      "492 (para. 11). \n",
      "[57]  That being so, the law recognizes that\n",
      "the sentence reserved for dangerous offenders is meant to apply only to that\n",
      "small group of offenders whose personal characteristics and particular\n",
      "circumstances militate strenuously in favour of indefinite preventive\n",
      "detention. The corollary of this is that the sentence reserved for long-term\n",
      "offenders is reserved for that much larger group of offenders whose risk of\n",
      "re-offence, while exceptional, appears open to eventual control in the\n",
      "community or, put another way, appears open to reduction to an acceptable level\n",
      "in the community through the imposition of a long-term offender sentence: R.\n",
      "v. Lemaigre (paras. 11, 15, and 16). \n",
      "[58]  The concern to segregate these offenders\n",
      "along these lines is the particular concern of s. 753.1(1)(c), in the sense\n",
      "that an offender who otherwise qualifies as a dangerous offender is\n",
      "nevertheless to be regarded as a long-term offender and sentenced as such if,\n",
      "according to s. 753.1(1)(c), “there is a reasonable possibility of eventual\n",

      "working basis for segregating the truly dangerous offender from the long-term\n",
      "offender, great care must be taken, when applying the subsection, to respect\n",
      "its terms. Subsection 753.1(1)(c) assumes the existence of a substantial\n",

      "of re-offence identified in the particular case. This is the risk of which the\n",
      "subsection speaks. And it speaks to it in terms of whether there is a reasonable\n",

      "\n",
      "39     The\n",
      "sentencing option available in relation to long-term offenders bears further\n",
      "comment. It has two parts to it: a period in prison and a period of community\n",
      "supervision. Regard must be had for both. Indeed, regard must be had for their\n",
      "combined effect when considering the potential for reducing the threat of\n",
      "public harm to an acceptable level in the community. An appropriate period of\n",
      "imprisonment can have deterrent and rehabilitative effects on the individual.\n",
      "So can an appropriate period of community supervision, which can also have a\n",
      "restraining effect. Hence, both merit consideration, especially as they operate\n",
      "in tandem.\n",
      "40     In considering the\n",
      "latter, regard must be had for the conditions that attach, or may be attached,\n",
      "to an order for community supervision, as provided for by the Corrections\n",

      "enhance the efficacy of community supervision and hence to reduce the threat of\n",
      "public harm to an acceptable level, are not to be overlooked or undervalued.\n",
      "41     To begin with, section\n",
      "161(1) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act Regulations (SOR/92-620)\n",

      "long-term offenders as it \"considers reasonable and necessary in order to\n",

      "the offender.\" This serves to clothe the Parole Board with extensive power\n",
      "in relation to reducing the threat of public harm to an acceptable level during\n",

      "clothes the Board with the power to suspend the operation of a long-term\n",

      "the offender. Furthermore, the Board is authorized to exercise this power in\n",

      "[63]  These powers and others, including the\n",

      "set of tools to control the risk of re-offence in the community and foster its\n",
      "further reduction.  This is not to be glossed over when applying s.\n",
      "753.1(1)(c).  Nor is the fact that community supervision may extend over\n",

      "Code, which renders it an indictable offence, punishable by imprisonment\n",

      "[64]  Nor should it be forgotten, when\n",
      "applying s. 753.1(1)(c), that the sentence reserved for long-term offenders, as\n",
      "opposed to that reserved for dangerous offenders, is the lesser of the two. The\n",
      "significance of this lies in the fact the law mandates the imposition of the\n",

      "[65]  The essential point of the whole of the\n",
      "foregoing is that it is imperative when applying s. 753.1(1)(c) to keep in mind\n",
      "this underlay of principle, including in particular the cast of the terms of\n",
      "the subsection, since these terms provide the working basis for segregating the\n",
      "truly dangerous offender from the long-term offender and, hence, for choosing\n",
      "between the sentence reserved for dangerous offenders and that reserved for\n",
      "long-term offenders.   \n",
      "[66]  With that, we turn to the first ground\n",
      "of appeal and the question it raises. \n",
      "Did the trial judge improperly discount Dr. Wormith’s\n",
      "positive assessment of the prospect of reducing Mr. S.D.B.’s risk of re-offence\n",
      "to an acceptable level in the community through the imposition of a suitable\n",
      "long-term offender sentence?\n",
      " \n",
      "[67]  To put the question into perspective, it\n",
      "will be recalled that the trial judge, in applying s. 753.1(1)(c) of the Criminal\n",
      "Code, concluded in effect that there was no reasonable possibility of\n",
      "eventual control in the community of Mr. S.D.B.’s risk of re-offence by means\n",
      "of a long-term offender sentence. Having come to this conclusion, he found Mr.\n",
      "S.D.B. to be dangerous offender, rather than a long-term offender, and\n",
      "sentenced him accordingly.  The trial judge, it is said, came to this\n",
      "conclusion in error, for he improperly discounted Dr. Wormith’s positive\n",
      "assessment of the prospects of eventual control of the risk in the community\n",
      "through the imposition of a long-term offender sentence of the sort Dr. Wormith\n",
      "had in mind.\n",
      "[68]  It will also be recalled that the trial\n",
      "judge did not discount the whole of Dr. Wormith’s assessment, or even major\n",
      "portions of it. Rather he discounted only that portion pertaining to Dr.\n",
      "Wormith’s assessment of the prospects of the eventual control in the community\n",
      "of Mr. S.D.B.’s risk of re-offence through the imposition of a suitable\n",
      "long-term offender sentence.  Hence, it is only this portion of the assessment\n",
      "that is in question. For ease of reference in addressing the question we shall\n",
      "refer to this portion of the assessment as simply the assessment, meaning not\n",
      "the whole of the assessment, of course, but only this portion of it. \n",
      "[69]  This, then, serves to put the question\n",
      "into perspective and to define the terms upon which we propose to address it. \n",
      "[70] That said, Mr. S.D.B. contended that the\n",
      "trial judge, in evaluating the assessment, failed to have proper regard for its\n",
      "foundation, for the whole of the evidence bearing upon the subject-matter of\n",
      "the assessment, and for the underlay of principle at work in cases such as\n",
      "these. The Attorney General contended otherwise.  \n",
      "[71]  In the light of all of this, it is\n",
      "necessary to have a close look at the assessment, including the foundation for\n",
      "it and the basis upon which the judge discounted it.  \n",
      "1.       The Assessment     \n",
      "[72]  In Dr. Wormith’s assessment, the\n",
      "prospect of the eventual control in the community of Mr. S.D.B.’s risk of\n",
      "re-offence was within the realm of reasonable possibility on the assumption the\n",
      "man:  \n",

      "serve a fixed\n",
      "term of imprisonment of sufficient length to allow him to participate in and\n",
      "potentially profit from several intensive treatment and corrections programs\n",
      "aimed at addressing the factors underlying his risk of re-offence; and \n",
      "•               \n",
      "be placed\n",
      "thereafter on long-term supervision in the community under appropriate conditions\n",
      "providing for suitable follow-up and control.  \n",
      "(1)      The\n",
      "Foundation for the Assessment \n",
      "[73]  The foundation consists of: (a) the\n",
      "treatment and corrections programs Dr. Wormith had in mind, both in prison and\n",
      "beyond; and (b) the potential utility of such programs in Mr. S.D.B.’s\n",
      "case.  \n",
      "(a)    The Available Treatment and Corrections Programs \n",
      "[74]  There was a good deal of evidence about\n",
      "what was available in these respects in the Saskatchewan Penitentiary, where Mr.\n",
      "S.D.B. was and is incarcerated. There was also quite a lot of evidence of the\n",
      "treatment and other programs available in the First Nations communities around\n",
      "Kamsack, including the Cote Reserve where Mr. S.D.B. originated. \n",
      "[75]  As for the Penitentiary, the\n",
      "Correctional Service of Canada there offers a multitude of high intensity,\n",
      "moderate intensity, and maintenance programs, many of which are tailored to the\n",
      "rehabilitation of offenders with a significant criminal history, aboriginal\n",
      "offenders in particular. These include intensive programs related to alcohol\n",
      "and drug dependency, domestic violence, sexual offending, anger management,\n",
      "cultural understanding and enrichment, and so on. Typically, the intensive\n",
      "versions of such programs are conducted in succession, take from six to eight\n",
      "months to complete, and require attendance from Monday through Friday for five\n",
      "to six hours a day. Many of the high intensity programs are conducted with the\n",
      "assistance of a psychologist or a First Nations elder. \n",
      "[76]  The Saskatchewan Penitentiary, it might\n",
      "be noted, is the only federal institution in the region to offer a High\n",
      "Intensity Sexual Offenders Program and a High Intensity Aboriginal Domestic\n",
      "Violence Program. These are specifically adapted to aboriginal offenders. It\n",
      "might also be noted that the Penitentiary offers a High Intensity Substance\n",
      "Abuse Program, a program available to aboriginal males in their forties with a\n",
      "long history of substance abuse and sexual/family violence. All such high\n",
      "intensity programs, once completed, are followed up with a Relapse Prevention\n",
      "Plan. \n",
      "[77]  The Penitentiary offers one other\n",
      "program that merits specific mention. Designed specifically for aboriginal\n",
      "offenders, it is called the “In Search of Your Warrior Program”. This is a six\n",
      "month, high intensity program geared toward fostering understanding of, and\n",
      "instilling pride in, First Nations traditions, culture, and beliefs to the end\n",
      "of further discouraging resort to violence by offenders of aboriginal\n",
      "ancestry.   \n",
      "[78]  With that, we turn from what the\n",
      "Penitentiary offers to what is available in the community, particularly the\n",
      "First Nations communities in the Kamsack area, including the Cote, Keeseekoose,\n",
      "and Key Reserves. As noted earlier, there was quite a lot of evidence of this.\n",
      "As it happened, much of it came from two of Mr. S.D.B.’s sisters, both of whom\n",
      "are heavily involved in the delivery of community services of the kind Dr.\n",
      "Wormith had in mind in assessing the prospects of reducing the risk of offence\n",
      "to a manageable level over time and by resort to the treatment and other\n",
      "corrections programs available in prison and beyond.\n",
      "[79]  The one sister, who had overcome alcohol\n",
      "dependence and earned a degree in social work, heads up the clinical component\n",
      "of the Circle of Strength Counselling Program on the Keeseekoose Reserve. This\n",
      "program employs six staff members and provides family counselling, crisis\n",
      "management, individual and group therapy, anger and life-skills management,\n",
      "recreational services, and the like. Her brother, she said, had reached out to\n",
      "her, asking for help, noting that of late he had shown signs of openness to\n",
      "help in overcoming his problems.     \n",
      "[80]  She also said that she and the Band\n",
      "Council had marked out their expectations of her brother, including the\n",
      "expectation he would assume some of the leadership role his father had played,\n",
      "and some of the work his grandfather had done in connection with the Sundance\n",
      "Lodge on the Cote Reserve, a traditional ceremonial lodge in need of\n",
      "restoration. She went on to express the belief that her brother, were he to\n",
      "take advantage of what was available to him on the Cote and Keeseekoose\n",
      "Reserves, could maintain an alcohol-free and crime-free lifestyle, saying he\n",
      "would have her support, and the support of those of his children and\n",
      "grandchildren who lived on the Cote Reserve.\n",
      "[81]  The other sister, who is a drug and\n",
      "alcohol counsellor in the employ of the Saulteaux Healing and Wellness Centre\n",
      "located in Kamsack, outlined the services offered by the Centre to First\n",
      "Nations people from the nearby Cote, Keeseekoose, and Key Reserves. These\n",
      "services are offered with the assistance of Elders and are aimed at fostering\n",
      "understanding of, and participation in, a wide array of Saulteaux cultural\n",
      "traditions. The Centre also offers a 20 day substance abuse and relapse\n",
      "prevention program. All of these services were available in relation to her\n",
      "brother, she said. \n",
      "[82]  In addition, the Saulteaux Spiritual\n",
      "Healer on the Cote Reserve testified, saying he offered sweat lodge and other\n",
      "traditional healing experiences aimed at spiritual rebirth, clearness of\n",
      "thought, and strength of mind, adding that Mr. S.D.B. had also reached out\n",
      "to him. He had known Mr. S.D.B. from youth, he said, noting that their fathers\n",
      "had grown up together.\n",
      "[83]  These, then, were among the programs of\n",
      "treatment and follow-up Dr. Wormith had in mind in assessing the prospects\n",
      "of the eventual control in the community of Mr. S.D.B.’s risk of\n",
      "re-offence.  \n",
      "(b)    The Potential\n",
      "Utility of Such Programs in this Case\n",
      "[84]  What Dr. Wormith had to say of the\n",
      "matter is this. Treatment presented a challenge and, since Mr. S.D.B.’s\n",
      "experience with treatment was limited, particularly recently, assessing the\n",
      "prospects of success was difficult. Nevertheless, Mr. S.D.B. “has the potential\n",
      "to participate in and benefit from an intensive long-term treatment program\n",
      "that addresses his criminogenic needs”, he stated, noting that the man is\n",
      "“quite motivated” in this regard.\n",
      "[85]  He then went on to elaborate, commenting\n",
      "upon the current level of the man’s maturity, motivation, insight, and mode of\n",
      "thought, as well as his recent behavior in prison, where he had eschewed gang\n",
      "involvement and become a model prisoner, even a mentor of sorts to other\n",
      "inmates. What he had to say of these matters is this:  \n",
      "Although his last experience with an intensive, relatively long\n",
      "term treatment program met with mixed results, that program was at the RPC\n",
      "[Regional Psychiatric Centre] many years ago (1986) when he was still in his\n",
      "late adolescence/early adulthood and lacked the maturity which he now has to\n",
      "reap the benefit of treatment.\n",
      "Mr. S.D.B. is bright, articulate and not one to shy away from\n",
      "personal conversation, at least not now. I believe he is also quite motivated\n",
      "to participate in such treatment and displays a reasonable degree of insight\n",
      "into the nature of his problems, in spite of the previously cited minimization\n",
      "that is reflected in his commentary. For example, he appreciates the impact\n",
      "that his rampant philandering has had on his relationships and indirectly on at\n",
      "least some of his offending. He also appreciates the extent of his drinking problem\n",
      "and realizes that he has to make some wholesale changes in this area if he is\n",
      "to remain problem free in the future. I would also suggest that the reputation\n",
      "that he has developed during his more recent sentences and while on remand for\n",
      "his current sentence reflect an increasing maturity in Mr. S.D.B.’s\n",
      "disposition. In sum, it appears that Mr. S.D.B. is in the ‘contemplative’ stage\n",
      "of change (Prochaska & DiClemente, 1986) and is ready to become seriously\n",
      "involved in an active intervention program.\n",
      "[86]  At that, Dr. Wormith expanded upon Mr.\n",
      "S.D.B.’s present attitude toward treatment and programming, saying this: \n",
      "Moreover, he is quite explicit about his intentions to pursue\n",
      "a variety of treatment initiatives. This was apparent both in his verbal\n",
      "commentary and his objective written testing using the PAI [Personality\n",
      "Assessment Inventory]. Admittedly, his current legal status could have\n",
      "influenced him in making these statements. However, the genuine emotion and\n",
      "affect that Mr. S.D.B. expressed suggests that, even if …his current status\n",
      "influenced his presentation, he also has an underlying and sincere desire to\n",
      "change his lifestyle.\n",
      "[87]  Having said this, Dr. Wormith went on\n",
      "to comment on the potential effectiveness of treatment, and on the forms of\n",
      "intensive treatment and programming in prison he would recommend in this case: \n",
      "\n",
      "Research in corrections suggests\n",
      "that the best correctional treatment programs may reduce recidivism rates by as\n",
      "much as 50 percent of the existing ‘base’ rate, although reductions of 10 to 20\n",
      "percent are much more common (Andrews & Bonta, 2003; McGuire, 2005). The\n",
      "kinds of programs that I would recommend for Mr. S.D.B. include the following:\n",
      "intensive versions of a domestic violence program, a sex offender program, an\n",
      "alcohol and drug program and possibly an anger and emotions program depending\n",
      "on the content of the other programs. Typically the intensive (daily) versions\n",
      "of each of these programs require six months and would have to be offered in\n",
      "succession. In addition, I would highly recommend both vocational training and\n",
      "cultural programming for Mr. S.D.B.. The former would assist him to formalize\n",
      "some of his natural skill and self-acquired knowledge and to capitalize on his\n",
      "intellectual capacity and positive work ethic. The latter would foster stronger\n",
      "connections with his aboriginal heritage and the positive social activities and\n",
      "support that can emerge from these activities.\n",
      "[88]  Dr. Wormith then turned to what might\n",
      "be done on Mr. S.D.B.’s eventual release from prison under long-term community\n",
      "supervision:  \n",
      "I would also suggest that a phased release with close\n",
      "monitoring in the community, particularly in the early months following Mr.\n",
      "S.D.B.’s release from custody, be entertained. Research has shown that\n",
      "custodial treatment and an integrated supervision plan in the community do have\n",
      "the potential of lowering the likelihood of recidivism of high risk offenders\n",
      "to some degree. In my view, a combination of institutional treatment coupled by\n",
      "a strong system of community support will be very important to Mr. S.D.B.’s\n",
      "long term success in the community.\n",
      "Given his chronic problem with domestic violence and with\n",
      "alcohol and substance abuse, I would suggest that long term supervision may be\n",
      "favoured over the kind of supervision that occurs with a traditional statutory\n",
      "release and is sometimes (partially or completely) lost if an offender is\n",
      "detained beyond his statutory release date (up to his warrant expiry date). In\n",
      "my view, Mr. S.D.B. is the kind of offender who not only can benefit from a\n",
      "strong system of community support, including that which is provided by the\n",
      "justice and correctional systems, but will actually require such assistance in\n",
      "order to desist from crime in the community.\n",
      "[89]  In this same vein, Dr. Wormith later\n",
      "suggested that serious consideration be given to making a long–term supervision\n",
      "order, because Mr. S.D.B. “would be an appropriate candidate to benefit\n",
      "from the kinds of supervision and services that such a sanction can offer”. \n",
      "[90]  On the whole, then, this is the\n",
      "foundation for Dr. Wormith’s positive assessment of the prospect of the\n",
      "eventual control in the community of Mr. S.D.B.’s risk of re-offence.\n",
      "That, then, brings us to why the trial judge did not accept the assessment.   \n",
      "(c)     The Trial Judge’s\n",
      "Reasons for Not Accepting the Assessment   \n",
      "[91]   At bottom, the judge rejected Dr.\n",
      "Wormith’s positive assessment because he did not agree with two components of\n",
      "the foundation for it, namely Mr. S.D.B.’s motivation (as Dr.\n",
      "Wormith saw the matter), or his lack of motivation (as the judge saw it) to\n",
      "participate in and profit from the proposed forms of intervention in prison and\n",
      "beyond; and, Mr. S.D.B.’s sincerity, or lack of it, in relation to his\n",
      "expressed desire to participate in the treatment and other programs available\n",
      "in the community. \n",
      "[92]  In the interests of identifying the\n",
      "point of disagreement more precisely, we note that Dr. Wormith’s assessment of\n",
      "the matter was this: Despite Mr. S.D.B.’s past failures to respond to\n",
      "rehabilitation programs, he is presently “quite motivated” to “participate in\n",
      "and profit from an intensive long-term treatment program that addresses his\n",
      "criminogenic needs”; is now  “ready to become seriously involved in an active\n",
      "intervention program”; has shown “genuine emotion and affect” in this regard;\n",
      "and has “an underlying and sincere desire to change his lifestyle”, albeit this\n",
      "may have been attributable in part to the man’s current legal status as a\n",
      "potential dangerous offender.   \n",
      "[93]  Having regard for this, the judge’s\n",
      "reasons for rejecting the assessment are oriented toward explaining why he\n",
      "disagreed with Dr. Wormith in these respects, or why, in other words, he\n",
      "disagreed with these components of the foundation for Dr. Wormith’s positive\n",
      "assessment of the prospects of reducing the risk of re-offence to an acceptable\n",
      "level in the community through the imposition of a long-term offender sentence\n",
      "of the sort Dr. Wormith had in mind. \n",
      "2.     The Analysis of the Judge’s\n",
      "Reasons for Rejecting the Assessment  \n",
      "[94]   As a matter of principle, the judge was\n",
      "not bound to have accepted the assessment. He was obliged to judicially\n",
      "consider and weigh it, having proper regard for its foundation, for the\n",
      "evidence bearing upon the subject, and for the underlay of general principle at\n",
      "work here. But he was not obliged to act on the assessment, or any portion of\n",
      "it. Rather, he was free, on a proper consideration of it, to accept or reject\n",
      "it, in whole or in part, for it was he who had ultimately to decide if, having\n",
      "regard for all of the evidence touching upon the subject, there existed a\n",
      "“reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the community”\n",
      "through the imposition of a long-term sentence as contemplated by\n",
      "s.  753.1(1)(c): R. v. Brass, 2011 SKCA 125, 375 Sask.\n",
      "R. 280.\n",
      "[95]  In the light of this, the issue to which\n",
      "the first ground of appeal gives rise reduces to whether the trial judge\n",
      "properly evaluated the assessment in the circumstances of the case, including,\n",
      "of course, the whole of the evidence bearing upon the matter.   \n",
      "[96]  The judge opened by saying that, while\n",
      "he agreed with Dr. Wormith that Mr. S.D.B. was capable of participating in\n",
      "and potentially profiting from intensive long-term treatment, he disagreed with\n",
      "Dr. Wormith’s assessment that Mr. S.D.B. was motivated to do so. There\n",
      "is nothing in the evidence, the judge observed, to demonstrate this, nothing,\n",
      "that is, aside from the man having said he would like to take advantage of the\n",
      "forms of intervention proposed by Dr. Wormith. But he had said much the same\n",
      "thing in the past, the judge noted, yet he had repeatedly failed in the past to\n",
      "respond to treatment and other corrections programs. He had simply reverted to\n",
      "his former ways. \n",
      "[97]  These opening remarks, as they pertain\n",
      "to Mr. S.D.B.’s motivation, are problematic in two respects. \n",
      "[98]  First, it is not quite accurate to\n",
      "suggest there was nothing in the evidence to demonstrate that Mr. S.D.B. was so\n",
      "motivated; nothing, that is, save for his professed desire to take advantage of\n",
      "the proposed forms of intervention.  With respect, there was more to the\n",
      "evidence than this, including the evidence that the man had entered upon middle\n",
      "age, was showing signs of increased maturity and insight, was turning from a\n",
      "‘legalistic’ to a ‘contemplative’ mode of thought, had become a model prisoner\n",
      "and something of a mentor to other inmates, and had begun to reach out to\n",
      "others for help with an apparent openness to help that he had not displayed in\n",
      "the past. This evidence, it might be noted, went un-contradicted and appears to\n",
      "have been accepted.  \n",
      "[99]  There was evidence, too, of a measure of\n",
      "objective confirmation that Mr. S.D.B. was genuinely interested in\n",
      "self-reform at this stage in his life. Dr. Wormith spoke to this in the\n",
      "context of the positive results of the Personality Assessment Inventory test he\n",
      "had administered. He was quick to add, however, that the results may have been\n",
      "influenced by the man’s current legal status. Even so, motivation is\n",
      "motivation, and if it derives, even in significant part, from fear of being\n",
      "locked away as a dangerous offender it is not the less real for that.  \n",
      "[100]   Second, to put as much stock as the\n",
      "judge did in Mr. S.D.B.’s past failures to respond to similar forms of\n",
      "intervention is difficult to justify in the circumstances of  the case. In\n",
      "fairness to the judge, Mr. S.D.B. had certainly failed in the past to profit\n",
      "from similar forms of intervention, either by reason of disinterest,\n",
      "lackadaisical commitment, or weakness of resolve. And the judge was certainly\n",
      "entitled to have regard for this. Still, it was incumbent upon him to evaluate\n",
      "the significance of this in the context of the whole of the evidence bearing on\n",
      "the matter. \n",
      "[101]   The whole included the factors\n",
      "mentioned above, namely Mr. S.D.B.’s present age and current levels of\n",
      "maturity, insight, mode of thought, fear of being locked away indefinitely, and\n",
      "so on. Just as importantly, the whole also included evidence to the effect the\n",
      "treatment and other corrections programs presently proposed were qualitatively\n",
      "different from those Mr. S.D.B. had failed to respond to in the past. The\n",
      "latter consisted in the main of provincial programs that were less intense and\n",
      "sustained and specific than the federal programs available in the Penitentiary.\n",
      "\n",
      "[102]   This is especially so of the high\n",
      "intensity versions of the programs available in the Penitentiary to aboriginal\n",
      "offenders with a history of offence akin to that of Mr. S.D.B.’s.\n",
      "Dr. Wormith drew attention to this difference, respectfully suggesting it\n",
      "was of noteworthy significance. There was no suggestion to the contrary.     \n",
      "[103]   In addition, the whole of the evidence\n",
      "included the fact Mr. S.D.B. had in middle-age clearly arrived at a major\n",
      "cross-roads in his life, for he faced the prospect of being locked away\n",
      "indefinitely as a dangerous offender. He had faced nothing of the kind in the\n",
      "past, nothing even remotely resembling this. Dr. Wormith thought this, too, was\n",
      "of noteworthy significance in relation to the man’s present motivation, as\n",
      "opposed to his past lack of motivation, to participate in and profit from the\n",
      "forms of intervention currently proposed. \n",
      "[104]   What Dr. Wormith had in mind in this\n",
      "connection was the fact the sentences Mr. S.D.B. had received in the past were\n",
      "of comparatively short duration. Only once had he been sentenced to a term of\n",
      "imprisonment in excess of two years less a day. That was in 1985, when, just\n",
      "short of his twentieth birthday, he was sentenced to a term of three years.\n",
      "Otherwise, his sentences, to the extent they consisted of imprisonment, were\n",
      "usually in the range of three to nine months. On the odd occasion they exceeded\n",
      "this range but were still under two years; mostly well under two years. And,\n",
      "with only one exception, these sentences were imposed while he was in his\n",
      "teens, twenties and thirties. The exception is a sentence of 45 days in custody\n",
      "he received in January of 2006 for being unlawfully at large.\n",
      "[105]   As Dr. Wormith observed, Mr. S.D.B.’s\n",
      "realization that he faced the prospect of serving a sentence of indefinite\n",
      "preventive detention may have accounted in part for the man’s present\n",
      "motivation to come to grips with the things in his life that lay beneath his\n",
      "criminal conduct, including his drinking, philandering, and propensity to\n",
      "resort to violence, especially domestic violence when drinking. But, as Dr.\n",
      "Wormith implied, motivation is motivation, no matter its stimulus. \n",
      "[106]   Viewed in the light of all of this, we\n",
      "are of the respectful opinion that the trial judge, in evaluating Mr. S.D.B.’s\n",
      "motivation or lack of it, put too much stock in the man’s past failures to take\n",
      "advantage of, or profit from, the treatment and other programs made available\n",
      "to him in the past. \n",
      "[107]   With the greatest of respect, then, we\n",
      "are unable to accept the trial judge’s opening remarks as providing a\n",
      "reasonable basis for rejecting Dr. Wormith’s positive assessment of Mr.\n",
      "S.D.B.’s motivation. To the extent these opening remarks may be seen to reflect\n",
      "findings of fact, we might add, we are unable to defer to them, for in our\n",
      "respectful opinion the whole of the evidence suggests otherwise, and quite\n",
      "clearly so.   \n",
      "[108]   Now, the judge had more to say of the\n",
      "matter than this, though in a sense it is all of a piece. But he did go on to\n",
      "say that he doubted Mr. S.D.B.’s sincerity in stating he would like to\n",
      "take advantage in the future of the support available to him in the community,\n",
      "which is to say the First Nations communities in the Kamsack area, including\n",
      "the Cote and Keeseekoose Reserves. The judge explained the basis for his doubt,\n",
      "saying that, while Mr. S.D.B. was a member of the Saulteaux or Cote First Nation\n",
      "and had grown up on the Cote Reserve, he had not lived on the Reserve for\n",
      "several years. And, aside from his historical roots, there was nothing in his\n",
      "past to suggest he had any interest in the cultural and healing traditions of\n",
      "his Saulteaux heritage. Nor anything to indicate he was seriously interested in\n",
      "living on the Reserve in the future.   \n",
      "[109]   The judge went on to say that he did\n",
      "not doubt the good intentions and sincerity of those persons (the two sisters\n",
      "included), who testified to the First Nation’s programs available to persons on\n",
      "the Cote, Keeseekoose, and Key Reserves. Rather, he doubted Mr. S.D.B.’s sincerity\n",
      "in saying he would like to take advantage of these resources, noting that,\n",
      "while the man had children living on the Cote Reserve, there was nothing in the\n",
      "evidence to indicate that he had any friends on the Reserve, or that the Band\n",
      "Council, aside from providing him with a house, could do anything “to ensure\n",
      "that the other reserve members would not be put at risk by his offending\n",
      "behaviours.” \n",
      "[110]   With respect, we are of the view there\n",
      "is no more in these added remarks than there is in the opening remarks to\n",
      "justify rejection of Dr. Wormith’s positive assessment of Mr. S.D.B.’s motivation\n",
      "regarding the treatment and other programs available in prison or, for that\n",
      "matter, Mr. S.D.B.’s sincerity in relation to his willingness to\n",
      "participate in the follow-up programs available in the community. Indeed, this\n",
      "business of sincerity, and what the trial judge had to say of it, is\n",
      "troublesome for two reasons. \n",
      "[111]   First, what the judge said of Mr.\n",
      "S.D.B.’s sincerity rests upon a questionable appreciation of the relevance of sincerity\n",
      "in the context of assessing the prospects of satisfactorily dealing with the\n",
      "risk of re-offence through long-term community supervision following release\n",
      "from prison. The relevance of sincerity is one thing in the context of an\n",
      "expressed willingness to undertake a voluntary course of action. Its relevance\n",
      "is quite another in the context of a compulsory course of action externally\n",
      "prescribed and enforced, as is customary of long-term community supervision\n",
      "managed by the Parole Board. Even to the extent sincerity is relevant in the latter\n",
      "context, it is clearly of much less import than in the former. All of which\n",
      "suggests the trial judge made too much of this business of sincerity.\n",
      "[112]   Second, the judge’s remarks in this\n",
      "connection reflect what appears to have been an unwitting departure from the\n",
      "underlay of principle informing the application of the provisions of the Criminal\n",
      "Code regarding dangerous and long-term offenders. He said that the Band,\n",
      "aside from providing Mr. S.D.B. with a house on the Cote Reserve, could do\n",
      "nothing “to ensure” that the community would not be at risk were he to settle\n",
      "there upon his eventual release from prison. Aside from the fact the law is not\n",
      "concerned with the elimination of the risk, but only of its reduction to an\n",
      "acceptable level in the community, it is not for the Band to manage the risk.\n",
      "It is for others to do so, particularly the Parole Board, which has the power,\n",
      "among others, to enforce compliance with the conditions that attach, or may be\n",
      "attached, to long-term supervision in the community. The Band can provide\n",
      "support, of course, including support in the form of the First Nations’\n",
      "treatment and other programs available to Band members. But that is about it.\n",
      "The rest is for others, especially the Parole Board. This seems to have been\n",
      "overlooked. \n",
      "[113]   In sum, the judge’s rejection of Dr.\n",
      "Wormith’s positive assessment of the prospects of the eventual control in the\n",
      "community of Mr. S.D.B.’s risk of re-offending came to rest on the judge’s\n",
      "disagreement with two aspects of the foundation for the assessment, namely Mr.\n",
      "S.D.B.’s motivation and sincerity in relation to the proposed\n",
      "forms of intervention. \n",
      "[114]   With the greatest of respect, we are\n",
      "of the view the judge’s evaluation of these aspects of the matter is materially\n",
      "flawed and cannot, therefore, sustain his conclusion that, notwithstanding Dr.\n",
      "Wormith’s assessment, there was no reasonable possibility of the eventual\n",
      "control of the risk in the community as contemplated by s. 753.1(1)(c) of the Criminal\n",
      "Code. In other words, we are of the view that, in light of the whole of Dr.\n",
      "Wormith’s assessment and the whole of the evidence touching the matter, there\n",
      "was no reasonable ground for the judge to ultimately conclude that, on the\n",
      "basis of motivation and sincerity, Mr. S.D.B. should be found to be a dangerous\n",
      "offender, rather than a long-term offender.\n",
      "[115]   Speaking more broadly, we are of the\n",
      "opinion Mr. S.D.B. qualifies as a long-term offender, for in our judgment there\n",
      "is a reasonable possibility of eventually reducing his risk of re-offence to an\n",
      "acceptable level in the community by means of the imposition of a suitable\n",
      "long-term offender sentence.  We say that having in mind the whole of the\n",
      "evidence and a number of related considerations, including (i) the underlay of\n",
      "principle at work in the case; (ii) the whole of the assessment made by Dr. Wormith,\n",
      "including his assessment of the nature and quality of the risk of re-offence\n",
      "and the factors underlying the risk; (iii) the lack of any other such\n",
      "assessment, particularly to the contrary; (iv) the impressive quality of the\n",
      "treatment and other programs available to aboriginal offenders such as Mr.\n",
      "S.D.B., both in prison and in the community; and (v) the powers enjoyed by the\n",
      "Parole Board in relation to long-term community supervision.  \n",
      "[116]   The trial judge, we might add, did not\n",
      "doubt the good intentions and sincerity of the two sisters heavily involved in\n",
      "the delivery of the First Nations programs material to the case. If one accepts\n",
      "their evidence, as the judge appears to have done, the treatment, follow-up,\n",
      "and other programs they referred to are highly relevant, extensive, and well\n",
      "funded. This speaks to an impressive level of commitment in these First Nations\n",
      "communities to caring for the troubled among them. This ties in with the\n",
      "impressive level of commitment behind the multitude of high intensity and other\n",
      "programs available in the Saskatchewan Penitentiary, geared as they are in so\n",
      "many ways to the rehabilitation of aboriginal offenders, including the like of\n",
      "Mr. S.D.B.. In our judgment, this should reasonably have counted for more\n",
      "than it did in this case; more, that is, in the context of segregating the\n",
      "truly dangerous offender from the long-term offender for the purposes of\n",
      "sentencing. \n",
      "[117]   For these reasons, then, we have\n",
      "decided to allow the appeal and set aside the sentence imposed upon Mr. S.D.B..\n",
      "Our reasons for doing so pertain in particular to the first of the grounds of\n",
      "appeal, but it will be apparent that the reasons spill over into the other\n",
      "grounds. It is unnecessary, however, to specifically address the others.  \n",
      "[118]   While we have decided to set aside the\n",
      "sentence, we are in no position to replace it with a suitable long-term\n",
      "sentence, as Mr. S.D.B. asked us to do, for we do not know what has transpired since\n",
      "the original sentence was imposed. Hence, we shall have to remit the case to\n",
      "the trial judge to impose a suitable long-term offender sentence having regard\n",
      "for the situation as it presently exists. There will be judgment accordingly. \n"
