"the police had confidential source information that their target was in possession of a large quantity of cocaine and that he kept most of his drugs on his person.", "Mr. Ali was found next to a table with drugs, other than cocaine, and with items consistent with drug trafficking, including a scale, money, and a ringing cell phone.

HISTORY
=======

user: This case was previously heard in the Alberta Court of Appeal. What did the previous court or courts decide?

"A majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal affirmed his conviction for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking.","They found that the trial judge did not err in determining that the police’s strip search of Mr. Ali, incident to his lawful arrest, complied with s. 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in accordance with the principles governing strip searches set out by this Court in R. v. Golden, 2001 SCC 83, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 679.","I further acknowledge that, as the courts below found no breach of s. 8 in this case, they did not consider whether the evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2).","At trial, counsel for Mr. Ali noted the search was “as humane as possible given the circumstances” (trial transcript, A.R., at p. 173)."

user: "What legal questions do these sentences contain?"

"Mr. Ali now concedes that Cst. Darroch’s testimony was not inadmissible hearsay because it was not entered for the truth of its contents; the question, he maintains, was whether Cst. Darroch could reasonably rely on the information from Cst. Odorski as a factor in deciding whether he had reasonable and probable grounds to request the strip search."
"Like the majority of the Court of Appeal, we are satisfied that there were reasonable and probable grounds justifying the strip search"
"We would not give effect to Mr. Ali’s argument that a hearsay error arose because the officer who requested the strip search, Cst. Darroch, testified that he was told by another officer, Cst. Odorski, that Mr. Ali was reaching towards the back of his pants, and Cst. Odorski did not refer to this in his testimony at trial."

assistant: "The legal questions contained in these sentences are related to the admissibility of testimony in a criminal trial and whether there were reasonable and probable grounds justifying a strip search. Additionally, there is a question of whether a hearsay error occurred due to the testimony of the officers involved in the search."

user: "Express these issues as questions to be answered"

"1. Was the testimony of Cst. Darroch admissible hearsay, and if not, was he justified in relying on the information from Cst. Odorski in deciding to request a strip search?
2. Were there reasonable and probable grounds justifying the strip search?
3. Did a hearsay error occur due to the conflicting testimony of the officers involved in the search?"

RULES
-----

user: "What legal rules did the majority use for their analysis?"

"Where a strip search is conducted as an incident to a person’s lawful arrest, there must be reasonable and probable grounds justifying the strip search, in addition to reasonable and probable grounds justifying the arrest (see Golden, at para. 99).","These grounds are met for the strip search where there is some evidence suggesting the possibility of concealment of weapons or other evidence related to the reason for the arrest (see Golden, at paras. 94 and 111)."

assistant: "The majority used the legal rule that for a strip search conducted as an incident to a lawful arrest, there must be reasonable and probable grounds justifying both the arrest and the strip search. The grounds for the strip search are met when there is some evidence suggesting the possibility of concealment of weapons or other evidence related to the reason for the arrest."

ANALYSIS
--------

user: "How did the majority apply the legal rules to the case's facts?"

assistant: "The majority applied the legal rules to the case's facts by finding that there were reasonable and probable grounds justifying the strip search. They rejected Mr. Ali's argument that a hearsay error arose and noted that defense counsel chose not to cross-examine either officer about the information, which undermined Mr. Ali's submission that it was unreasonable for the officer to rely on the information."

----------
CONCLUSION
----------

user: "What conclusion did the majority reach and how did they decide the appeal?"

"A majority of this Court agrees with the conclusion of the majority of the Court of Appeal and would dismiss the appeal.","We would not give effect to Mr. Ali’s argument that a hearsay error arose because the officer who requested the strip search, Cst. Darroch, testified that he was told by another officer, Cst. Odorski, that Mr. Ali was reaching towards the back of his pants, and Cst. Odorski did not refer to this in his testimony at trial.","For these reasons, we would dismiss the appeal.","As in Golden, I acknowledge that Mr. Ali has already served his custodial sentence."

user: "What legal questions do these sentences contain?"

"In my view, the respondent Crown failed to discharge its burden of establishing the legal basis for the strip search of Mr. Ali in accordance with the principles set out by this Court in Golden.","As such, I find that Mr. Ali’s s. 8 Charter rights were violated, substantially for the reasons of Veldhuis J.A., at paras. 27‑61.","Relying on Golden, at paras. 118‑19, Mr. Ali argues that this Court should substitute an acquittal because conducting an analysis under s. 24(2) of the Charter would be a mere theoretical exercise.","First, the seriousness of the police conduct in this case was at the lowest end of the spectrum.","Second, the impact of the strip search on Mr. Ali’s privacy interests, while serious, was somewhat attenuated by the reasonable manner in which it was conducted.","The final Grant inquiry strongly favours admission.","On balance, I conclude that excluding the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.",

To exclude evidence under the Charter, the court must find that
1. The state breached a Charter-protected interest; and
2. The breach was sufficiently serious to justify excluding evidence.
The second part of this test asks three questions:
1. Was the Charter breach serious?
2. What impact did the breach have on the defendant?
3. Does society nonetheless have an interest in admitting the evidence at trial?
Did the court use this analysis? If so, what did it find?

assistant: "Yes, the court used this analysis. The court found that the strip search of Mr. Ali violated his s. 8 Charter rights and that the seriousness of the police conduct in this case was at the lowest end of the spectrum. The court also found that the impact of the strip search on Mr. Ali’s privacy interests, while serious, was somewhat attenuated by the reasonable manner in which it was conducted. The court further found that the final Grant inquiry strongly favoured admission and that, on balance, excluding the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute."
