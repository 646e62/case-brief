I selected cases based solely on the style of cause, including all cases that followed the style *R v Defendant* or *Defendant v R*. As this is a NLP project, I only selected English decisions, thereby limiting the number of reported (quasi-)criminal cases from Quebec."

       ", for both the Crown and defence.  The new law came into effect on September 19, 2019.</br></br>Despite being readily foreseeable that the repeal would be contentious, and challenged in court, Parliament did not clarify by express wording whether the repeal of peremptory challenges was to apply retrospectively to all jury cases in the system, or prospectively only to charges filed after September 19, 2019.  Had Parliament done so, the retrospective/prospective issue would have been moot; certainty and finality would have been assured.</br></br>This is of no small moment, as errors in a jury selection process can often result in a trial being nullified and having to be repeated; wasting the original trial, inconveniencing or losing witnesses who have to be found and testify again, adding delay and generally increasing the strain the judicial system operates under daily.  Not to mention that jury trials often involve the most serious crimes tried in our system, including for instance all manner of murder and sexual assault.</br></br>I am aware of five decisions dealing with this issue to date.  Predictably, given the nature of a specific application, the circumstances, the evidence led and the analysis by the judge, the judgments do not all reach the same conclusion.  Three in Ontario found the repeal and new law is retrospective, while one case in each New Brunswick and British Columbia found the changes prospective.  No Court of Appeal has yet weighed in.  This decision is the first in \n",

       ".  But the peremptory challenge was older yet, dating to the 14th century, about the year 1300, when a person charged with a felony was allowed 35 peremptory challenges by common law.  Fast forwarding hundreds of years, in 1892 Canada incorporated peremptory challenges into its Criminal Code.  The number of statutory peremptory challenges stayed the same since, for 127 years, until its repeal, effective September 19, 2019.</br></br>Sir William Blackstone, Knight, Commentaries on the Laws of England, William Draper Lewis ed., vol. 4 (Philadelphia: \n",

       " is repeatedly cited for the historical context of peremptory challenges.  Blackstone explained it is “a provision full of that tenderness and humanity to prisoners for which our English laws are justly famous.”  It has two basis: (1) that the law ensures that a defendant will not be tried by any individual in whom he perceives a prejudice, even if the defendant is unable to show the bias; and (2) the fear that unsuccessfully challenging such a person for cause may leave a defendant concerned for any ill-feeling he perceives the process may instill to the person challenged.  As such, a peremptory challenge allows a party to dismiss a person from serving on the jury without providing any reason.</br></br>[Clearly, the basis of a peremptory challenge is purely subjective and always has been.

In other words, I find it applies forward to charges laid on or after its effective date of September 19, 2019.</br></br>Before setting out my reasons, I note that the test articulated by Deschamps J. in Dineley is whether the new law “affects” substantive rights.

       " more narrowly “impaired” a substantive right or more broadly “affected” such a right.  Either way, the taking away or eliminating a right is the most absolute and complete way to affect, alter, interfere or impair it.  More important to this analysis is whether peremptory challenges were a substantive right.</br></br>The distinction between substantive rights and procedural mechanisms is not crisp but certain hallmarks can tilt the evaluation.  In Dineley the majority commented that “… new procedural legislation designed to govern only the manner in which rights are asserted or enforced does not affect the substance of those rights.” (\n",

       ").  Further, in the context of that case, new legislation affecting the content or existence of a defence, as opposed to the manner of its presentation, indicates a substantive right (\n",

       ").  While I do not suggest describing it as a right is determinative per se, it nonetheless is emblematic of how the peremptory challenge has been construed and regarded.  It was always seen as more than just a point of process;</br>•the peremptory challenge was a long-standing facet of an accused’s role in the trial.  It was not that he could have a jury of his choice, but through this unchecked power to reject some jurors, he could have a direct say, or influence, over the composition of the jury that would decide his fate.  Any seasoned onlooker would agree that this power was crucial to an accused.  I pause to note that this is materially different than the stand by or challenge for cause changes in the new law.  An accused did not have a role in a decision to stand by or in a decision of the triers as to whether a prospective juror was acceptable or not;</br>•the fundamental importance of peremptory challenges has also been recognized repeatedly in a most critical way.  Courts, including the Supreme Court, have nullified trials where a peremptory challenge was denied to an accused.  Cloutier affirmed that an accused need not show prejudice from such an error; the error itself is sufficient for a new trial to be ordered.  I also note the comments of Cromwell J. in \n",

       " rights;</br></br>•as noted, the changes take away the peremptory challenge entirely, as opposed to modifying it in some fashion; and finally</br>•there is an arbitrariness to the retrospectivity argument in that the cut-off is a point-in-time, September 19, 2019; again, bearing in mind that the accuseds were already charged and engaged in the judicial process when the changes came about.  Thus, it is solely a fluke of timing that determines which side of September 19, 2019 a case falls on, and with it the power or right to exclude some jurors an accused sees as biased.</br></br>Further, here three accused have no choice but to proceed with a jury and as such are unable to rearrange their legal affairs to account for a change in the law that took place after they were arrested.</br></br>I find that the statutory provisions of peremptory challenges available to these accused when they were charged with this offence was a substantive right, it was more than just a manner of or procedure for asserting other trial rights.  It was understood as a fundamental precept of jury trials, a protection for an accused for good and valid reasons.  Its repeal did not just affect the right, it took away the right itself, gutting its content and substance.  I fail to see how this change is procedural only.  To return to the hallmarks gleaned from Dineley, repeal of peremptory challenges does not govern only the manner in which rights are asserted, it affects the content and existence, function and effect, of peremptory challenges and the jury selection process itself.  It alters the character and legal effect of an accused’s role in jury selection.</br></br>A few final matters.</br></br>I am mindful that other Commonwealth jurisdictions have abolished peremptory challenges.  That however is not to say that peremptory challenges were not a substantive right.  Parliament is supreme and properly done can abolish or do away with peremptory challenges, and indeed they said they wanted to.  However they did not do that.  Unlike Britain, Canada did not abolish, by clear language in the legislation, peremptory challenges but rather it simply repealed the provision, leading to the present quagmire.</br></br>Given the scope of the application as narrowed and argued at the oral hearing, I leave it to another court to determine whether common law peremptory challenges have, through the language of this repeal, been resurrected.  In any event, that would only apply to charges arising after September 19, 2019, as those before then still have the benefit of prospective application of the new law.  I also note the difference of opinion between Subramaniam and Lako respecting vested rights.  Given my finding, I need not deal with that issue.</br></br>Further, to be clear, my conclusion is not tied to the other changes in the jury selection process dealing with standbys and challenges to cause.  By itself, the repeal of peremptory challenges affects an accused’s substantive rights.</br></br>Finally, I should by this decision not be seen to be expressing any view of Parliament’s policy decision to take away peremptory challenges.  All I am saying is that peremptory challenges need be seen for what they are, an important feature of jury trials and a substantive power, or right, exercised freely by accuseds and the Crown alike for hundreds of years.  Parliament has not made it sufficiently clear that the timing of abolishing peremptory challenges was to be retrospective.</br></br>Consistent with the presumption against retrospectivity in statutory interpretation, the change must be prospective.</br></br>VIII.  CONCLUSION</br></br>The accused’s application is allowed to the extent that the repeal of \n",
