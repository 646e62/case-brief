I selected cases based solely on the style of cause, including all cases that followed the style *R v Defendant* or *Defendant v R*. As this is a NLP project, I only selected English decisions, thereby limiting the number of reported (quasi-)criminal cases from Quebec."

Upon his arrest on December 4 , 2019 , the accused was found in possession of 164.5 grams of cocaine , over $ 50,000 in cash and drug - trafficking paraphernalia .   He conceded that he was a mid - level dealer in cocaine although he also maintained employment . \n",

By all accounts , he thrived at Teen Challenge and took significant steps towards rehabilitation , including taking on a leadership role and being a dedicated worker at the Lighthouse Mission .   He has expressed interest in becoming a pastor . \n",

[ H]is delusional beliefs are impacting on his ability to appreciate the potential outcome of court proceedings , as he believes that God has sent him messages that he will be acquitted despite the evidence against him .

As a result of this agreement , the Crown was relieved of its obligation to prove these aggravating facts beyond a reasonable doubt ( see \n",

It submitted that , if the sentencing judge found exceptional circumstances ( which it argued against ) , the sentence could be further reduced to 5.5 years .   The accused suggested that the appropriate sentencing range was four to five years but that his rehabilitation demonstrated exceptional circumstances , warranting a probationary sentence of three years . \n",

She sentenced the accused to one day in custody ( noting enhanced credit of eight months for time in pre - sentence custody ) and three years going forward of supervised probation .

It is not necessary to address all of the alleged errors in order to dispose of the appeal .   I will deal with the Crown ’s arguments that the sentencing judge erred in finding reduced moral culpability in the absence of a connection between the accused ’s mental health challenges and his offending behaviour ; in finding exceptional circumstances when none existed ; and in imposing a sentence that failed to give paramountcy to denunciation and deterrence . \n",
       " [ 17 ] The accused argues that his circumstances and the extent of his rehabilitation are truly exceptional and that this finding by the sentencing judge is entitled to deference , as is the sentence imposed .   He also asserts that the sentencing judge was entitled to find that his delusional disorder played a role in his offending behaviour and that a non - custodial sentence can have a denunciatory and deterrent effect . \n",

       "\n",
       " [ 22 ] Here , the sentencing judge relied on her finding of exceptional circumstances to justify a sentence well below what one would expect considering only the facts relating to the offence .   Her finding was based on the combination of what she found to be the accused ’s reduced moral culpability due to his mental health diagnosis and his significant rehabilitation since his arrest . \n",
       " [ 23 ] Dr. Waldman ’s report was not commissioned to assess whether there was a link between the accused ’s mental health and the offence , nor does it suggest such a link .   The only connection mentioned by Dr. Waldman is that the accused ’s “ pattern of substance use did contribute to the circumstances that led to his charges ” ( emphasis added ) .   That said , the accused was not trafficking drugs solely to feed an addiction .   He was also motivated by and did profit . \n",
       " [ 24 ] Dr. Waldman ’s report indicates that the accused ’s “ perception [ was ] that he began to experience detailed premonitions and began noting coincidences that had special meaning to him , which he believed were direct communications to him from God , in [ the ] spring of 2019 . ”   The accused reported to Dr. Waldman that he “ did not understand the purpose of these premonitions until he was in custody ” after his arrest .   He believed that “ God [ wa]s guiding him for a special mission that he [ had ] yet to discover ” and came to believe that he would not be convicted for his charges “ so that he c[ould ] pursue missionary work and help others . ”   There is no indication that the accused ’s delusions led in any way to his decision to facilitate a three - kilogram methamphetamine transaction .   In fact , the accused was unable to attribute any meaning to the delusions until after his arrest . \n",
       " [ 25 ] In my respectful view , the sentencing judge committed one of the errors in principle warned against in JMO :   “ assuming an offender ’s moral blameworthiness for an offence is reduced automatically because he or she has a mental illness or other cognitive limitation ” ( at para 73 ) .   In addition , the sentencing judge failed to properly assess the evidence in respect of the accused ’s delusional disorder and its relationship with his criminal conduct .   The record does not reasonably support the sentencing judge ’s conclusion that “ the delusions themselves [ we]re connected to drug trafficking or criminal type lifestyle . ”   Although the accused need not establish that his delusional disorder caused the offending behaviour , the accused did not meet his burden of demonstrating that it contributed to that behaviour ( see R v JED , \n",

       " Determination of a Fit Sentence \n",
       "\n",
       " [ 28 ] Deference is owed to those of the sentencing judge ’s findings that are not tainted by error .   The primary mitigating factor identified by the sentencing judge is the very significant steps the accused has taken to rehabilitate himself and to make reparations to the community harmed by his offending .   She also found that his cocaine use disorder and alcohol use disorder were mitigating .   Despite the accused not selling drugs to feed an addiction , Dr. Waldman ’s report indicates at least some limited connection between his substance abuse and his offending . \n",
       "\n",
       " [ 29 ] The Crown argues that , all else being equal , a fit sentence for this offence would be eight years , but that it should be reduced to six years due to the accused ’s rehabilitation .   From this sentence , the Crown submits that recognition should be given to the accused ’s time on probation since the sentencing and the eight months of enhanced credit for time in pre - sentence custody , for a reduction of one year .   In any event , the Crown suggests that the absolute floor for the sentence should be four years due to parity concerns — other offenders convicted in the same project were sentenced to four years and had significantly less involvement than the accused . \n",
       " [ 30 ] The accused asserts that the six - year sentence sought by the Crown is excessive .   He suggests that a fit sentence , not considering rehabilitation , would be 3.5 to four years but that his extensive rehabilitation necessitates a conditional sentence order or a stay of execution of reincarceration . \n",
       " [ 31 ] I agree with the Crown that , but for the accused ’s rehabilitation , a sentence of about eight years would be fit .   The accused ’s moral culpability is high and the aggravating factors significant .   At the age of 31 , the accused was trafficking drugs for profit while gainfully employed and living with his mother .   He amassed cash and acquired other assets , such as vehicles .   As aptly observed by the sentencing judge , “ methamphetamine is a scourge on our society . ” \n",
       " [ 32 ] However , the extent of the accused ’s rehabilitation and the time he has devoted to helping others is highly mitigating .   In light of the accused ’s rehabilitation and the effect of his substance - use disorders , I would impose a sentence of four years .   I would , in addition , reduce the sentence by four months in recognition of the time he has spent towards completing his probationary sentence .   Therefore , the sentence will be 44 months ’ incarceration .   As noted by the sentencing judge , the accused should be credited with eight months of enhanced credit for pre - sentence custody . \n",
       " [ 33 ] I am not persuaded that the accused has met the burden to demonstrate that it is in the interests of justice to stay execution of the custodial portion of his sentence .   In my view , reincarceration is required because of the seriousness of the offence , the length of the sentence remaining to be served , and the importance of denunciation and deterrence ( see R v McMillan ( BW ) , \n",
