Generates a FIRAC-style case brief from a reported decision


## What is a case brief?


In countries like Canada that use the common law system, reported court cases are an important legal source. 

Case briefs are short high-level case summaries that distill the precedential value from a reported decision.


## What is FIRAC?


FIRAC is an initialism that stands for **F**acts, **I**ssues, **R**ules, **A**nalysis/Application, and **C**onclusion. 


### Facts


An important common-law legal principle is the idea that parties in similar circumstances be treated similarly. To this end, the underlying **facts** of each case are most frequently used to compare and contrast similarly-situatied litigants. 


### Issues


At the heart of every reported decision is a legal issue, absent which there would be no legal case to write about.

### Rules

Where facts help identify similarly-situated litigants, the rules inform courts how such litigants should be treated.

### Analysis/application

The analysis portion of a case applies **rules** to **facts** in order to address the **issues** the parties raised. Broken down in this way, the analysis describes the underlying logic used to apply each element together.


### Conclusion

The conclusion briefly identifies the successful party and any judicial findings made or remedies awarded. It summarizes a case's outcome.


## Why is this useful?

## How does this program create case briefs?

This project operates on the hypothesis that these five elements can reliably be found and identified in most reported decisions using NLP techniques. It adopts David Guenther's premise, outlined in [FIRAC: An ELEMENTary Approach](http://www.daveguenther.com/firac/judicialopinionsintro.html), that different linguistic components in reported cases (sentences, paragraphs, key words, etc) can be thought of as FIRAC elements,
